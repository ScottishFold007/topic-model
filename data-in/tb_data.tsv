10.1038_s41598_017_17705_3	Culture and Next-generation sequencing-based drug susceptibility testing unveil high levels of drug-resistant-TB in Djibouti: results from the first national survey	Djibouti is a small country in the Horn of Africa with a high TB incidence (378/100,000 in 2015). Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and resistance to second-line agents have been previously identified in the country but the extent of the problem has yet to be quantified. A national survey was conducted to estimate the proportion of MDR-TB among a representative sample of TB patients. Sputum was tested using XpertMTB/RIF and samples positive for MTB and resistant to rifampicin underwent first line phenotypic susceptibility testing. The TB supranational reference laboratory in Milan, Italy, undertook external quality assurance, genotypic testing based on whole genome and targeted-deep sequencing and phylogenetic studies. 301 new and 66 previously treated TB cases were enrolled. MDR-TB was detected in 34 patients: 4.7% of new and 31% of previously treated cases. Resistance to pyrazinamide, aminoglycosides and capreomycin was detected in 68%, 18% and 29% of MDR-TB strains respectively, while resistance to fluoroquinolones was not detected. Cluster analysis identified transmission of MDR-TB as a critical factor fostering drug resistance in the country. Levels of MDR-TB in Djibouti are among the highest on the African continent. High prevalence of resistance to pyrazinamide and second-line injectable agents have important implications for treatment regimens.

10.3389_fmicb.2017.02452	Repurposing and Revival of the Drugs: A New Approach to Combat the Drug Resistant Tuberculosis	Emergence of drug resistant tuberculosis like multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) and totally drug resistant tuberculosis (TDR-TB) has created a new challenge to fight against these bad bugs of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Repurposing and revival of the drugs are the new trends/options to combat these worsen situations of tuberculosis in the antibiotics resistance era or in the situation of global emergency. Bactericidal and synergistic effect of repurposed/revived drugs along with the latest drugs bedaquiline and delamanid used in the treatment of MDR-TB, XDR-TB, and TDR-TB might be the choice for future promising combinatorial chemotherapy against these bad bugs.	drug resistance tuberculosis; repurposing; revival of drugs; synergistic effect; proteomics and bioinformatics	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS; IN-VITRO; ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY; CLOFAZIMINE; KANAMYCIN; AMIKACIN; TB; SUSCEPTIBILITY
10.1007_s15010_017_1054_8	Outcomes of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Zambia: a cohort analysis	The purpose of this study was to establish a baseline for measuring the impact of the programmatic management of drug-resistant TB program by following up on outcomes of all patients diagnosed with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Zambia between 2012 and 2014. A cohort study of all the MDR-TB patients diagnosed at the national TB reference laboratory from across Zambia. MDR-TB was diagnosed by culture and DST, whereas outcome data were collected in 2015 by patient record checks and home visits. The total number of patients diagnosed was 258. Of those, 110 (42.6%) patients were traceable for this study. There were 67 survivor participants (60.9%); 43 (39.1%) were deceased. Out of the 110 patients who were traced, only 71 (64.5%) were started on second-line treatment. Twenty-nine (40.8%) patients were declared cured and 16.9% were still on treatment; 8.4% had failed treatment. The survival rate was 20.2 per 100 person-years of follow-up. Taking ARVs was associated with a decreased risk of dying (hazard ratio 0.12, p = 0.002). Sex, age, marital status and treatment category were not important predictors of survival in MDR-TB patients. More than half of the patients diagnosed with MDR-TB were lost to follow-up before second-line treatment was initiated.

10.1016_j.jgar.2017.07.002	Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in Morocco	Objectives: Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has recently been identified as a major global health threat. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of XDR-TB among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in Morocco and its association with demographic, clinical and epidemiological features. Methods: A total of 524 patients from the Moroccan National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory, representative of all of the geographic regions, were subject to first-line drug susceptibility testing (DST). Subsequently, 155 isolates found to be multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) underwent second-line DST. Moreover, to enhance our understanding of the genetic basis of these drug-resistant strains, drug resistance-associated mutations were investigated in isolates either identified as pre-XDR- and XDR-TB or suspected resistant using the GenoType (R) MTBDRsl V1.0 assay. Results: In this study, 4 (2.6%) XDR-TB and 18 (11.6%) pre-XDR-TB isolates were identified. Agreement between the MTBDRsl assay results and phenotypic DST was 95.2% for ofloxacin, 81.0% for kanamycin and 95.2% for amikacin. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the frequency of XDR-TB in Morocco. These results highlight the need to reinforce the TB management policy in Morocco with regard to control and detection strategies in order to prevent further spread of XDR-TB isolates.

10.1016_j.ijid.2017.09.019	Trends and characteristics of drug-resistant tuberculosis in rural Shandong, China	Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe the secular trends in drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) and to identify unique characteristics of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in rural China. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted using TB data collected from 36 TB prevention and control institutions serving rural populations in Shandong Province, China, for the period 2006-2015. Results: Approximately 8.3% of patients suffered from MDR-TB, among whom 70% were newly treated patients; this rate increased by 1.3% annually during the 10-year study period. An increase in the percentage of overall first-line drug resistance against isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and streptomycin was confirmed (p < 0.05). The percentage of MDR-TB in new and previously treated cases increased at yearly rates of 9.9% and 11.1%, respectively. MDR-TB patients were more likely to be female (odds ratio (OR) 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-1.89), smokers (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.47-2.07), to have had recent TB contact (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.04-2.42), or to have been retreated (OR 2.89, 95% CI 2.46-3.41). Conclusions: Increasing MDR-TB and rates of primary MDR-TB characterize DR-TB cases in rural China. Persistent efforts need to be made among MDR-TB patients in future TB control strategies.

10.1016_j.ijid.2017.10.013	Treatment outcomes of rifabutin-containing regimens for rifabutin-sensitive multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis	Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether rifabutin can improve treatment outcomes in patients with rifabutin-sensitive MDR-TB. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed on 76 patients with rifabutin-sensitive MDR-TB who were treated with or without rifabutin between 2006 and 2011. Results: Overall, 75% (57/76) of patients achieved favorable outcomes, including cure (53/76, 70%) and treatment completion (4/76, 5%). In contrast, 25% (19/76) had unfavorable treatment outcomes, which included treatment failure (6/76, 8%), death (2/76, 3%), loss to follow-up (4/76. 5%), and no evaluation due to transfer to other institutions (7/76, 9%). Rifabutin was given to 52 (68%) of the 76 patients with rifabutin-sensitive MDR-TB. Although favorable treatment outcomes were more frequent in patients who received rifabutin [81% (42/52)] than in those who did not receive rifabutin [63% (15/24)], this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.154). However, in multivariable regression logistic analysis, use of rifabutin was significantly associated with favorable treatment outcomes in patients with rifabutin-sensitive MDR-TB (adjusted odds ratio = 9.80, 95% confidence interval = 1.65-58.37, P = 0.012). Conclusions: These results suggest that the use of rifabutin can improve treatment outcomes in patients with rifabutin-sensitive MDR-TB. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

10.1007_s11094_017_1690_4	Tuberculostatic Activity of 2-Amino-6-Chloropurine Derivatives	Studies of the antimycobacterial activity of 2-amino-6-chloropurine and its N-acyl derivatives against laboratory (Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, M. avium, M. terrae) and clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains (MDR-TB) identified compounds with high tuberculostatic activity (MIC from 0.35 - 1.5 mu g/ml). The cytotoxic activities of the compounds with antimycobacterial activity against human embryo fibroblasts were studied in the MTT test, which showed that the study compounds were essentially nontoxic (IC50 > 50 mu M). Further chemical modification may yield compounds with potential for creating drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis. With the aim of identifying the possible mechanism of the tuberculostatic activity, the ability of the study compounds to inhibit mycobacterial serine-threonine protein kinases (STPK) was assessed. The tuberculostatic activity of 2-amino-6-chloropurine derivatives was not linked with their inhibition of STPK.	purines; tuberculostatic activity; protein kinases	ANTIMYCOBACTERIAL ACTIVITY; ANALOGS; PURINES; INHIBITORS; AGELASINE; TARGETS
10.5588_ijtld.16.0953	Renal function of MDR-TB patients treated with kanamycin regimens or concomitantly with antiretroviral agents	SETTING: To compare renal insufficiency among multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients treated with kanamycin (KM) based regimens and those treated concomitantly with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or other antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens in Namibia. DESIGN: Retrospective review of the treatment records and laboratory tests of patients initiated on MDR-TB treatment (January-December 2014). The glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) estimated pre-and post-treatment were compared using the analysis of variance test. Renal insufficiency was defined as an eGFR of,60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Use of KM or TDF and association with renal insufficiency was assessed using Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox proportional hazards analysis. RESULTS: The baseline mean eGFR for the three groups was similar (P = 0.24): 139.3 6 25.6 ml/min for the KM group (n = 68), 131.1 6 25.7 ml/min for the KM+TDF group (n = 44) and 134.2634.4 ml/min for the KM+Other group (n = 23). After 8 months, the values had declined significantly to respectively 104.8 +/- 37.5 ml/min (P < 0.001), 101.5 6 38.3 ml/min (P < 0.001) and 111.5 6 41.7 ml/min (P = 0.01). Co-treatment with KM+ARTwas associated with an increased risk of renal insufficiency (hazard ratio [HR] 1.8, 95% CI 0.7-4.1, P = 0.20 for KM+TDF, and HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.4-8.2, P = 0.005 for KM+Other ART). CONCLUSION: Renal function declined at a similar rate in MDR-TB patients treated with KM-based regimens compared with patients treated concomitantly with TDF-based or other ART. The risk of renal insufficiency was greater for patients on ART.	nephrotoxicity; TB-HIV co-infection; aminoglycosides; nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors; Namibia	INDUCED NEPHROTOXICITY; INDUCED NEPHROPATHY; INFECTED PATIENTS; FANCONI-SYNDROME; HIV; TENOFOVIR; TUBERCULOSIS; AMINOGLYCOSIDES; THERAPY
10.1093_jac_dkx316	Identification of novel mutations associated with cycloserine resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Objectives: D-Cycloserine is an important second-line drug used to treat MDR- and XDR-TB. However, the mechanisms of resistance to D-cycloserine are not well understood. Here we investigated the molecular basis of D-cycloserine resistance using in vitro-isolated resistant mutants. Methods: Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv was subjected to mutant selection on 7H11 agar plates containing varying concentrations of D-cycloserine. A total of 18 D-cycloserine-resistant mutants were isolated and subjected to WGS. The identified mutations associated with D-cycloserine resistance were confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Results: We identified mutations in 16 genes that are associated with D-cycloserine resistance. Interestingly, we found mutations only in alr (rv3423c) encoding alanine racemase, but not in other known D-cycloserine resistance-associated genes such as ddl, cycA or ald. Instead, we identified 13 new genes [rv0059, betP (rv0917), rv0221, rv1403c, rv1683, rv1726, gabD2 (rv1731), rv2749, sugI (rv3331), hisC2 (rv3772), the 50 intergenic region of rv3345c and rv1435c, and the 30 region of rv0759c] that had solo mutations associated with D-cycloserine resistance. Our findings indicate that the mechanisms of D-cycloserine resistance are more complex than previously thought and involve genes participating in different cellular functions such as lipid metabolism, methyltransferase, the stress response and transport systems. Conclusions: New mutations in diverse genes associated with D-cycloserine resistance have been identified that shed new light on the mechanisms of action and resistance of D-cycloserine. Future studies are needed to verify these findings in clinical strains so that molecular detection of D-cycloserine resistance for improved treatment of MDR-TB can be developed.

10.1016_j.jgar.2017.06.010	Distribution scheme of antituberculosis drug resistance among HIV patients in a referral centre over 10 years	Objectives: Antituberculosis drug resistance is increasing among tuberculosis (TB) patients globally, particularly in those who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive. The aim of this study was to determine the pattern of anti-TB drug resistance in these patients in an effort to improve successful treatment outcomes with a proper regimen. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on adult TB/HIV co-infected patients from 2005-2015. The pattern of anti-TB drug resistance was evaluated among HIV-positive patients with and without a history of TB treatment. Categorisation was made as follows: isoniazid (INH)-resistant; rifampicin (RIF)resistant; or multidrug-resistant (MDR). Results: A total of 52 patients were enrolled in this study (median age 38 years). Among the 52 patients, 18 (34.6%) were MDR-TB patients and the rest were monoresistant TB (resistant either to INH or RIF). INH resistance was the most common resistance pattern (36.5%) noted among patients and was significantly associated with new TB cases (69% vs. 31%; P = 0.01). During TB treatment, 3/48 patients (6.3%) failed treatment and 11/48 (22.9%) died. Patients with MDR-TB were more likely to die during treatment (44.4% vs. 10%; P = 0.011). Conclusions: Any drug resistance in previously treated TB cases among HIV-infected patients remains high. The risk of death is increasing in MDR-TB/HIV co-infected patients.

10.1097_INF.0000000000001691	Treatment Outcomes of Children With HIV Infection and Drug-resistant TB in Three Provinces in South Africa, 2005-2008	Objective: To describe outcomes of HIV-infected pediatric patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR TB). Methods: Demographic, clinical and laboratory data from charts of pediatric patients treated for DR TB during 2005-2008 were collected retrospectively from 5 multi-DR TB hospitals in South Africa. Data were summarized, and Pearson (2) test or Fisher exact test was used to assess differences in variables of interest by HIV status. A time-to-event analysis was conducted using days from start of treatment to death. Variables of interest were first assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard models were fit to estimate crude and adjusted hazard ratios. Results: Of 423 eligible participants, 398 (95%) had culture-confirmed DR TB and 238 (56%) were HIV infected. A total of 54% were underweight, 42% were male and median age was 10.7 years (interquartile range: 5.5-15.3). Of the 423 participants, 245 (58%) were successfully treated, 69 (16%) died, treatment failed in 3 (1%), 36 (9%) were lost to follow-up and 70 (17%) were still on treatment, transferred or had unknown outcomes. Time to death differed by HIV status (P = 0.008), sex (P < 0.001), year of tuberculosis diagnosis (P = 0.05) and weight status (P = 0.002). Over the 2-year risk period, the adjusted rate of death was 2-fold higher among participants with HIV compared with HIV-negative participants (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.28; 95% confidence interval: 1.11-4.68). Conclusions: Male, underweight and HIV-infected children with DR TB were more likely to experience death when compared with other children with DR TB within this study population.

10.1016_j.diagmicrobio.2017.08.016	Laboratory evaluation of the Anyplex (TM) II MTB/MDR and MTB/XDR tests based on multiplex real-time PCR and melting-temperature analysis to identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis and drug resistance	We evaluated the performance of two multiplex, real-time PCR tests (Anyplex II MTB/MDR and MTB/XDR; Seegene, Seoul, Korea), designed to detect the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) and drug-resistance mutations associated with isoniazid, rifampicin, fluoroquinolones, and second-line injectable drugs. We analyzed 122 clinical isolates with the Anyplex II MTB/MDR test, 68 of which were also tested with the Anyplex II MTB/XDR test. The Anyplex II MTB/MDR and MTB/XDR tests showed the following respective sensitivities and specificities: 68.8% and 100% for detecting isoniazid resistance, 93.8% and 100% for rifampicin, 82.8% and 100% for levofloxacin, 75.0% and 100% for kanamycin, and 92.6% and 100% for MTC identification. These kits correctly identified 61.8% of multi-drug resistant M. tuberculosis isolates and 64.7% of extensively drug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates, and enabled semi-automatic detection of drug-resistant MTC in 3 hours. The Anyplex II kits could be useful as rule-in tests for detecting MTC and drug resistance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

10.1007_s10096_017_3082_9	Molecular screening of multidrug-resistance tuberculosis by a designated public health laboratory in Taiwan	This manuscript describes our experience in early identifying MDR-TB cases in high-risk populations by setting up a single-referral molecular diagnosis laboratory in Taiwan. Taiwan Centers for Disease Control designated a single-referral laboratory to provide the GenoType MTBDRplus test for screening high-risk MDR-TB populations nationwide in 2012-2015. A total of 5,838 sputum specimens from 3,308 patients were tested within 3 days turnaround time. Compared with the conventional culture and drug susceptibility testing, the overall performance of the GenoType MTBDRplus test for detecting TB infection showed accuracy of 70.7%, sensitivity of 85.9%, specificity of 65.7%, positive predictive value of 45.5%, and negative predictive value of 93.3%. And the accuracy of detecting rifampin (RIF) resistance, isoniazid (INH) resistance, and MDR-TB (resistant to at least RIF and INH) were 96.5%, 95.2%, and 97.7%, respectively. MDR-TB contacts presented a higher rate of mutated codons 513-519, GenoType MTBDRplus banding pattern: rpoB WT3(-), and rpoB WT4(-) than the treatment failure group. The MDR-TB contact group also had a higher rate of inhA C15T mutation, banding pattern: inhA WT1(-), and inhA MUT1(+) than the recurrent group. Resistance profiles of MDR-TB isolates also varied geographically. The referral molecular diagnosis system contributed to rapid detection and initiation of appropriate therapy.

10.3389_fmicb.2017.02358	Molecular Characterization of Prothionamide-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates in Southern China	Prothionamide (PTH) has been widely used in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), especially multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), while data regarding prevalence of resistance-causing mutation is limited. In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular characteristics of PTH-resistant MTB isolates, and also analyzed the risk factors for PTH resistance among Mycobacterium tuberculosis(MTB) isolates in southern China. A total of 282 MTB isolates were enrolled in from Guangzhou Chest Hospital. Among these isolates, 46 (16.3%) were resistant to PTH. Statistical analysis revealed that PTH resistance was more likely to be associated with resistance to levofloxacin (LFX; OR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.02-4.63; P = 0.04). Of the 46 PTH-resistant MTB isolates, 37 (80.4%) isolates harbored 19 different mutation types, including 10 (21.7%) isolates with double nucleotide substitutions and 27 (58.7%) with single nucleotide substitution. The mutations in ethA (51.4%, 19/37) were most frequently observed among PTH-resistant isolates, followed by 16 (43.2%) in the promoter of inhA and 6 (16.2%) in inhA. In addition, no significant difference was found in the distribution of isolates with different mutation types between Beijing and non-Beijing genotypes (P > 0.05). In conclusion, our data demonstrate that high diversity of genetic mutations conferring PTH resistance is identified among MTB isolates from southern China. Mutations in inhA, ethA, mshA, and ndh genes confer increased resistance of MTB to PTH. Ancient Beijing genotype strains have higher proportion of drug resistance compared with modern Beijing strains. In addition, PTH resistance is more likely to be observed in the LFX-resistant MTB isolates.

10.1186_s13063_017_2292_x	An optimized background regimen design to evaluate the contribution of levofloxacin to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment regimens: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial	Background: Current guidelines for treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are largely based on expert opinion and observational data. Fluoroquinolones remain an essential part of MDR-TB treatment, but the optimal dose of fluoroquinolones as part of the regimen has not been defined. Methods/design: We designed a randomized, blinded, phase II trial in MDR-TB patients comparing across levofloxacin doses of 11, 14, 17 and 20 mg/kg/day, all within an optimized background regimen. We assess pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety and tolerability of regimens containing each of these doses. The primary efficacy outcome is time to culture conversion over the first 6 months of treatment. The study aims to determine the area under the curve (AUC) of the levofloxacin serum concentration in the 24 hours after dosing divided by the minimal inhibitory concentration of the patient's Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate that inhibits > 90% of organisms (AUC/MIC) that maximizes efficacy and the AUC that maximizes safety and tolerability in the context of an MDR-TB treatment regimen. Discussion: Fluoroquinolones are an integral part of recommended MDR-TB regimens. Little is known about how to optimize dosing for efficacy while maintaining acceptable toxicity. This study will provide evidence to support revised dosing guidelines for the use of levofloxacin as part of combination regimens for treatment of MDR-TB. The novel methodology can be adapted to elucidate the effect of other single agents in multidrug antibiotic treatment regimens.

10.2807_1560_7917.ES.2017.22.47.17_00103	Childhood multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the European Union and European Economic Area: an analysis of tuberculosis surveillance data from 2007 to 2015	Background: Confirming tuberculosis (TB) in children and obtaining information on drug susceptibility is essential to ensure adequate treatment. We assessed whether there are gaps in diagnosis and treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB in children in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA), quantified the burden of MDR TB in children and characterised cases. Methods: We analysed surveillance data from 2007 to 2015 for paediatric cases younger than 15 years. Results: In that period, 26 EU/EEA countries reported 18,826 paediatric TB cases of whom 4,129 (21.9%) were laboratory-confirmed. Drug susceptibility testing results were available for 3,378 (17.9%), representing 81.8% of the confirmed cases. The majority (n = 2,967; 87.8%) had drug-sensitive TB, 249 (7.4%) mono-resistant TB, 64 (1.9%) poly-resistant TB, 90 (2.7%) MDR TB and eight (0.2%) had extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. MDR TB was more frequently reported among paediatric cases with foreign background (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.73; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.12-2.67) or previous TB treatment (aOR: 6.42; 95% CI: 3.24-12.75). Successful treatment outcome was reported for 58 of 74 paediatric MDR TB cases with outcome reported from 2007 to 2013; only the group of 5-9 years-olds was significantly associated with unsuccessful treatment outcome (crude odds ratio (cOR) = 11.45; 95% CI: 1.24-106.04). Conclusions: The burden of MDR TB in children in the EU/EEA appears low, but may be underestimated owing to challenges in laboratory confirmation. Diagnostic improvements are needed for early detection and adequate treatment of MDR TB. Children previously treated for TB or of foreign origin may warrant higher attention.

10.1016_j.neucom.2016.08.151	Neural network models for supporting drug and multidrug resistant tuberculosis screening diagnosis	Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of global mortality among communicable diseases. The diagnosis of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (DR-TB) demands even more attention, leading to longer treatments and higher deceased rates. All diagnostic methods available have deficiencies in their detection rates, time release results, or have a higher cost and need a complex infrastructure to setup. New molecular diagnostics, such as the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, have great potential for revolutionizing the diagnosis of Rifampicin Resistance (RR). But, a positive RR result with this test should be carefully interpreted and take into consideration the risk of Multidrug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB) according to its prevalence, locally. Therefore, the development of screening approaches for DR/MDR-TB suspects would help to identify those should be tested by Xpert MTB/RIF. This work develops Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models considering data from presumed DR/MDR-TB subjects, according to the National Guidelines at Rio de Janeiro/Brazil, attended in reference centers in Rio de Janeiro, from Feb 2011 and May 2013. Subjects aged 18 years or older, and results were compared with models based on Classification And Regression Trees (CART). Practical operation at different epidemiological scenarios are considered by constructing models using different variable selection criteria, so that environments with low resource conditions can be assisted. Among 280 presumed DR-TB cases included, 38 were DR-TB, 48-MDR, 32-Drug-Sensitive and 162 with no TB. Between DR-TB and non DR-TB, the sensitivity and specificity reached 95.1%(5.0) and 85.0%(4.9), respectively.

10.3389_fmicb.2017.02296	Influence of Stress and Antibiotic Resistance on Cell-Length Distribution in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Clinical Isolates	Mycobacterial cellular variations in growth and division increase heterogeneity in cell length, possibly contributing to cell-to-cell variation in host and antibiotic stress tolerance. This may be one of the factors influencing Mycobacterium tuberculosis persistence to antibiotics. Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem in developing countries, antibiotic persistence, and emergence of antibiotic resistance further complicates this problem. We wanted to investigate the factors influencing cell-length distribution in clinical M. tuberculosis strains. In parallel we examined M. tuberculosis cell-length distribution in a large set of clinical strains (n = 158) from ex vivo sputum samples, in vitro macrophage models, and in vitro cultures. Our aim was to understand the influence of clinically relevant factors such as host stresses, M. tuberculosis lineages, antibiotic resistance, antibiotic concentrations, and disease severity on the cell size distribution in clinical M. tuberculosis strains. Increased cell size and cell-to-cell variation in cell length were associated with bacteria in sputum and infected macrophages rather than liquid culture. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains displayed increased cell length heterogeneity compared to sensitive strains in infected macrophages and also during growth under rifampicin (RIF) treatment. Importantly, increased cell length was also associated with pulmonary TB disease severity. Supporting these findings, individual host stresses, such as oxidative stress and iron deficiency, increased cell-length heterogeneity of M. tuberculosis strains. In addition we also observed synergism between host stress and RIF treatment in increasing cell length in MDR-TB strains. This study has identified some clinical factors contributing to cell-length heterogeneity in clinical M. tuberculosis strains. The role of these cellular adaptations to host and antibiotic tolerance needs further investigation.

10.3389_fcimb.2017.00478	Comparative Genomic Analysis of Two Clonally Related Multidrug Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis by Single Molecule Real Time Sequencing	Background : Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is posing a major threat to global TB control. In this study, we focused on two consecutive MDR-TB isolated from the same patient before and after the initiation of anti-TB treatment. To better understand the genomic characteristics of MDR-TB, Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) Sequencing and comparative genomic analyses was performed to identify mutations that contributed to the stepwise development of drug resistance and growth fitness in MDR-TB under in vivo challenge of anti-TB drugs. Result : Both pre-treatment and post-treatment strain demonstrated concordant phenotypic and genotypic susceptibility profiles toward rifampicin, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, cycloserine, ethionamide, and para-aminosalicylic acid. However, although both strains carried identical missense mutations at rpoB S531L, inhA C-15T, and embB M306V, MYCOTB Sensititre assay showed that the post-treatment strain had 16-, 8-, and 4-fold elevation in the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) toward rifabutin, isoniazid, and ethambutol respectively. The results have indicated the presence of additional resistant-related mutations governing the stepwise development of MDR-TB. Further comparative genomic analyses have identified three additional polymorphisms between the clinical isolates. These include a single nucleotide deletion at nucleotide position 360 of rv0888 in pre-treatment strain, and a missense mutation at rv3303c (lpdA) V44I and a 6-bp inframe deletion at codon 67-68 in rv2071c (cobM) in the post-treatment strain. Multiple sequence alignment showed that these mutations were occurring at highly conserved regions among pathogenic mycobacteria. Using structural-based and sequence-based algorithms, we further predicted that the mutations potentially have deleterious effect on protein function. Conclusion : This is the first study that compared the full genomes of two clonally-related MDR-TB clinical isolates during the course of anti-TB treatment. Our work has demonstrated the robustness of SMRT Sequencing in identifying mutations among MDR-TB clinical isolates. Comparative genome analysis also suggested novel mutations at rv0888, lpdA, and cobM that might explain the difference in antibiotic resistance and growth pattern between the two MDR-TB strains.	multidrug resistance; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; PacBio sequencing; growth rate; comparative genomic analysis	LEVEL ISONIAZID RESISTANCE; PARA-AMINOSALICYLIC ACID; ETHAMBUTOL RESISTANCE; RPOB MUTATIONS; TECHNOLOGY; RIFAMPIN; INDELS; FAMILY; IDENTIFICATION; STREPTOMYCIN
10.1186_s12879_017_2810_1	Treatment outcomes of MDR-tuberculosis patients in Brazil: a retrospective cohort analysis	Background: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a threat for the global TB epidemic control. Despite existing evidence that individualized treatment of MDR-TB is superior to standardized regimens, the latter are recommended in Brazil, mainly because drug-susceptibility tests (DST) are often restricted to first-line drugs in public laboratories. We compared treatment outcomes of MDR-TB patients using standardized versus individualized regimens in Brazil, a high TB-burden, low resistance setting. Methods: The 2007-2013 cohort of the national electronic database (SITE-TB), which records all special treatments including drug-resistance, was analysed. Patients classified as MDR-TB in SITE-TB were eligible. Treatment outcomes were classified as successful (cure/treatment completed) or unsuccessful (failure/relapse/death/loss to follow-up). The odds for successful treatment according to type of regimen were controlled for demographic and clinical variables. Results: Out of 4029 registered patients, we included 1972 recorded from 2010 to 2012, who had more complete outcome data. The overall success proportion was 60%. Success was more likely in non-HIV patients, sputum-negative at baseline, with unilateral disease and without prior DR-TB. Adjusted for these variables, those receiving standardized regimens had 2.7-fold odds of success compared to those receiving individualized treatments when failure/relapse were considered, and 1.4-fold odds of success when death was included as an unsuccessful outcome. When loss to follow-up was added, no difference between types of treatment was observed. Patients who used levofloxacin instead of ofloxacin had 1.5-fold odds of success. Conclusion: In this large cohort of MDR-TB patients with a low proportion of successful outcomes, standardized regimens had superior efficacy than individualized regimens, when adjusted for relevant variables. In addition to the limitations of any retrospective observational study, database quality hampered the analyses. Also, decision on the use of standard or individualized regimens was possibly not random, and may have introduced bias. Efforts were made to reduce classification bias and confounding. Until higher-quality evidence is produced, and DST becomes widely available in the country, our findings support the Brazilian recommendation for the use of standardized instead of individualized regimens for MDR-TB, preferably containing levofloxacin. Better quality surveillance data and DST availability across the country are necessary to improve MDR-TB control in Brazil.

10.1038_emi.2017.83	Improvement in clinical outcome and infection control using molecular diagnostic techniques for early detection of MDR tuberculous spondylitis: a multicenter retrospective study	There has been limited research on the therapeutic efficacy of molecular diagnosis of spinal tuberculosis. We attempted to determine whether the utilization of molecular diagnosis to detect multidrug-resistant spinal tuberculosis can improve clinical outcomes. A multicenter retrospective study was conducted from February 2009 to June 2015. Ninety-two consecutive culture-confirmed multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients with spinal tuberculosis who were diagnosed clinically and by imaging were enrolled in the study. The initial time to treatment for MDR-TB, the method of infection control, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and the occurrence of complications in patients who were diagnosed using molecular methods were compared with those of patients diagnosed using standard culture and drug susceptibility test methods. Of 92 MDR-TB patients with spinal tuberculosis, 41 (45%) were diagnosed by standard culture and drug susceptibility test methods (Group A), and 51 (55%) were diagnosed following implementation of detection using molecular diagnosis (Group B). The patients in Group B began the rational use of second-line drugs earlier than patients in Group A (5 days vs 73 days, P< 0.05). Among patients who were admitted to a general tuberculosis ward, those in Group B spent less time in the ward than those in Group A ( 4 days vs 33 days, Po0.05). At the one-month follow-up, the ESR was significantly lower in Group B. In patients who completed 6 months of follow-up (n= 92), the incidence of complications was significantly lower in Group B. The use of molecular diagnosis resulted in noteworthy clinical advances, including earlier initiation of MDR-TB treatment, improved infection control, better clinical outcome, a more rapid decrease in ESR and fewer complications.	clinical outcomes; multidrug-resistant; molecular diagnosis; tuberculous spondylitis	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; XPERT MTB/RIF; VALIDATION; ASSAYS
10.1186_s12879_017_2761_6	Prevalence and molecular characterization of pyrazinamide resistance among multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Southern China	Background: Pyrazinamide (PZA) plays a unique role in the treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in both first-and second-line regimens. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and molecular characterization of PZA resistance among MDR-TB isolates collected in Chongqing municipality. Methods: A total of 133 MDR-TB isolates were collected from the smear-positive tuberculosis patients who were registered at local TB dispensaries of Chongqing. PZA susceptibility testing was determined with a Bactec MGIT 960 system. In addition, the genes conferring for PZA resistance were screened by DNA sequencing. Results: Of these 133 MDR-TB isolates, 83 (62.4%) were determined as PZA-resistant by MGIT 960. In addition, streptomycin- (83.1% vs. 56.0%, P < 0.01), ofloxacin- (51.8% vs. 18.0%, P < 0.01), kanamycin- (22.9% vs. 2.0%, P < 0.01), amikacin- (18.1% vs. 2.0%, P = 0.01), capromycin-resistance (12.0% vs. 2.0%, P = 0.05), were more frequently observed among PZA-resistant isolates compared with PZA-susceptible isolates. Sequence analysis revealed that 73 out of 83 (88. 0%) MDR strains harbored a mutation located in the pncA gene, including 55 (75.3%, 55/73) of single nucleotide substitutions and 18 (24.7%, 18/73) of frameshift mutation, while no genetic mutation associated with PZA resistance was found in the rpsA gene. The pncA expression of strains harboring substitution from A to G at position -11 in the promoter region of pncA was significantly lower than that of H37Rv (P < 0.01). Conclusions: In conclusion, our data have demonstrated that the analysis of the pncA gene rather than rpsA gene provides rapid and accurate information regarding PZA susceptibility for MDR-TB isolates in Chongqing. In addition, loss of pncA expression caused by promoter mutation confers PZA resistance in MDR-TB isolates.		PNCA GENE; MUTATIONS; DIVERSITY; RPSA
10.1007_s10096_017_3025_5	Comparison of the characteristics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from sputum and lung lesions in chronic tuberculosis patients	Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in sputum originates from lung cavities in tuberculosis (TB) patients. But drug susceptibility testing (DST) of sputum Mtb can not be conducted the same as in the lung because mutagenesis of bacilli may be happening in the lung during treatment and result in the possibility of the presence of heterogeneous drug-resistant subpopulations in the different lung lesions. This could be one of the reasons for low cure rates for multi-drug resistant (MDR)-TB. We studied the resected lungs of nine surgery patients with chronic TB. The isolates isolated from the sputum and different lung lesions of each patient were tested for phenotypic DST and genotyped using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing method. Genetic analysis to resistance to first and second line drugs was also performed. Five of nine patients were MDR-TB and three XDR-TB. DST results for ten anti-TB drugs were in accordance among different lung lesions in eight patients. However, only three of these eight patients showed the concordance of DST with sputum. Even though the isolates were heteroresistant, genotyping them by RFLP showed the clonal population in each individual patient. Six of eight followed-up patients achieved successful cure. In conclusion, the heteroresistance between sputum and lung lesions and a clonal population without mixed infection might provide useful information in establishing treatment regimen and surgery decision for MDR- and XDR-TB.

10.1016_j.meegid.2016.07.001	Molecular epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Baja California, Mexico: A result of human migration?	The State of Baja California (BC) exhibits the highest incidence and prevalence rates of tuberculosis (TB), and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in Mexico. However information about the circulation of M. tuberculosis lineages in BC and Mexico as a whole is limited. Here, we describe the genetic relationship and genetic diversity among M. tuberculosis clinical isolates (n=140) collected in BC between October 2009 and April 2011 with other regions of Mexico, the United States, and Latin America. All specimens were genotyped based on 24 mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRU)-variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) loci. Population structure and minimum spanning tree (MST) analyses were used to assess the genetic diversity and distribution of BC isolates in comparison to USA and South America strains. Among the nine lineages observed, LAM, Haarlem and S were the most frequent identified in BC. Population structure analysis clustered most BC isolates (41%) into three distinctive groups that included strains from San Diego and South America, whereas other BC strains (22%) clustered with other Mexican strains. A subset of isolates (12%) seemed to be autochthonous of BC, while 25% were cosmopolitan and grouped into multiple clusters. It is highly likely that the TB genetic structure observed in BC is due to human migration. Additional studies are required to determine the mechanism involved in the phylogeographic distribution of M. tuberculosis in Mexico. Implementation of domestic molecular TB surveillance programs is required to better understand the molecular epidemiology of TB not only in the region but at the national level.

10.1016_j.meegid.2016.09.012	Molecular characterization of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from high prevalence tuberculosis states in Mexico	Mexico is one of the most important contributors of multidrug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Latin-America, however little is known about the molecular characteristics of these strains. For this reason, the objective of this work was to determine the genotype and characterize polymorphisms in genes associated with resistance to rifampicin, isoniazid, and second-line drugs in isolates from two regions of Mexico with high prevalence of drug resistant tuberculosis. Clinical isolates from individuals with confirmed MDR-TB were genotyped using MIRU-VNTR 12 loci. To characterize the polymorphisms in genes associated with resistance to rifampicin, isoniazid and second-line drugs; rpoB, katG, inhA, rrs, eis, gyrA, gyrB and tlyA were sequenced. 22 (41%) of the 54 MDR-TB isolates recovered were from the state of Baja California, while 32 (59%) were from Veracruz. The results show the katGS315T mutation was observed in 20% (11/54) of the isolates, while rpoBS315L was present in 33% (18/54). rrs had three polymorphisms (T1239C, ntA1401C and ntA1401G), gyrB presented no modifications, whereas gyrA showed five (S95T, F60Y, A90V, S91P and P124A), eis two (G-10A and A431G) and tlyA one (insertion at codon 67). Only 20% (11/54) of isolates were confirmed as MDR-TB by sequencing, and no mutations at any of the genes sequenced were observed in 43% (23/54) of the strains. Two isolates were recognized with the proper set of mutations like pre-XDR and one was XDR-TB. Eighteen isolates were classified as orphans and the remaining thirty-six were distributed in fourteen lineages, the most frequent were S (11%), Haarlem(9%), Ghana (9%) and LAM(7%). Out of the fourteen clusters identified, seven included unknown genotypes and nine had lineages. This is one of the most detailed analyses of genotypic characteristics and mutations associated with drug resistance to first and second-line drugs inMDR-TB isolates from Mexico. An important genetic variability and significant discrepancy between phenotypic tests and polymorphisms was observed. Our results set the need to screen additional loci as well as implement a molecular epidemiological surveillance system of MDR-TB in the country. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

10.5588_ijtld.17.0468	The devil we know: is the use of injectable agents for the treatment of MDR-TB justified?	For decades, second-line injectable agents (IAs) have been the cornerstone of treatment for multidrugresistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Although evidence on the efficacy of IAs is limited, there is an expanding body of evidence on the serious adverse events caused by these drugs. Here, we present the results of a structured literature review of the safety and efficacy of IAs. We review the continued widespread use of these agents in the context of therapeutic alternatives-most notably the newer TB drugs, bedaquiline and delamanid-and from the context of human rights, ethics and patient-centered care. We conclude that there is limited evidence of the efficacy of IAs, clear evidence of the risks of these drugs, and that persons living with MDR-TB should be informed about these risks and provided with access to alternative therapeutic options.	drug-resistant TB; MDR-TB; injectable agents; hearing loss; ototoxicity	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; EARLY BACTERICIDAL ACTIVITY; AMINOGLYCOSIDE-INDUCED OTOTOXICITY; POSITIVE PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; COMMUNITY-BASED THERAPY; HEARING-LOSS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; DRUG-RESISTANCE; ADVERSE EVENTS; XDR-TB
10.5588_ijtld.16.0826	Determinants of multidrug resistance among previously treated tuberculosis patients in Zimbabwe, 2014	SETTING: Zimbabwe. OBJECTIVE : To investigate the determinants of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) among previously treated TB patients. DESIGN: A 1:3 case-control study with bivariate analysis and logistic regression. RESULTS : Risk factors for MDR-TB were history of nursing an MDR-TB patient (adjusted OR [aOR] 4.46, 95% CI 2.02-9.88), history of hospitalisation for >= 3 days (aOR 2.91, 95%CI 1.62-5.23) and history of foreign travel and stay outside Zimbabwe (aOR 2.68, 95% CI 1.46-4.91). Protective factors were previous successful treatment (aOR 0.05, 95%CI 0.02-0.11), history of supervision by a health worker/village health worker (aOR 0.34, 95%CI 0.19-0.60) and having been treated not more than once previously for TB (aOR 0.18, 95% CI 0.08-0.38). No association between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and MDR-TB (aOR 1.00, 95%CI 0.53-1.88) was observed. However, among HIV-infected patients, those with CD4,200 cells/mm(3) were more likely to develop MDR-TB (aOR 4.62, 95%CI 2.49-8.53). CONCLUSION: Individual, service-related, social and demographic factors interact to determine multidrug resistance among previously treated TB patients. Infection control, treatment adherence, reduction of side effects and drug susceptibility testing must be strengthened to reduce the MDR-TB burden in Zimbabwe.	resistance; CD4; HIV; tuberculosis	EXTENSIVELY DRUG-RESISTANT; AFRICA
10.5588_ijtld.17.0230	Time to treatment for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis: systematic review and meta-analysis	BACKGROUND: To reduce transmission and improve patient outcomes, rapid diagnosis and treatment of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) is required. OBJECTIVE : To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing time to treatment for RR-TB and variability using diagnostic testing methods and treatment delivery approach. DESIGN: Studies from 2000 to 2015 reporting time to second-line treatment initiation were selected from PubMed and published conference abstracts. RESULTS : From 53 studies, 83 cohorts (13 034 patients) were included. Overall weighted mean time to treatment from specimen collection was 81 days (95%CI 70-91), and was shorter with ambulatory (57 days, 95%CI 4074) than hospital-based treatment (86 days, 95%CI 71-102). Time to treatment was shorter with genotypic susceptibility testing (38 days, 95%CI 27-49) than phenotypic testing (108 days, 95%CI 98-117). The mean percentage of diagnosed patients initiating treatment was 76% (95%CI 70-83, range 25-100). CONCLUSION: Time to second-line anti-tuberculosis treatment initiation is extremely variable across studies, and often unnecessarily long. Reduced delays are associated with genotypic testing and ambulatory treatment settings. Routine monitoring of the proportion of diagnosed patients initiating treatment and time to treatment are necessary to identify areas for intervention.	rifampicin-resistant; tuberculosis; time to treatment	COMMUNITY-BASED THERAPY; LINE-PROBE ASSAY; MDR-TB PATIENTS; SOUTH-AFRICA; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; TREATMENT INITIATION; PROGRAM CONDITIONS; XPERT(R) MTB/RIF; DIAGNOSIS
10.5588_ijtld.16.0839	Incorporating social justice and stigma in cost-effectiveness analysis: drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment	Novel therapies for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are likely to be expensive. The cost of novel drugs (e.g., bedaquiline, delamanid) may be so prohibitively high that a traditional cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) would rate regimens containing these drugs as not cost-effective. Traditional CEA may not appropriately account for considerations of social justice, and may put the most disadvantaged populations at greater risk. Using the example of novel drug regimens for MDR-TB, we propose a novel methodology, 'justice-enhanced CEA', and demonstrate how such an approach can simultaneously assess social justice impacts alongside traditional cost-effectiveness ratios. Justice-enhanced CEA, as we envision it, is performed in three steps: 1) systematic data collection about patients' lived experiences, 2) use of empirical findings to inform social justice assessments, and 3) incorporation of data-informed social justice assessments into a decision analytic framework that includes traditional CEA. These components are organized around a core framework of social justice developed by Bailey et al. to compare impacts on disadvantage not otherwise captured by CEA. Formal social justice assessments can produce three composite levels: 'expected not to worsen...', 'may worsen...', and 'expected to worsen clustering of disadvantage'. Levels of social justice impact would be assessed for each major type of outcome under each policy scenario compared. Social justice assessments are then overlaid side-by-side with cost-effectiveness assessments corresponding to each branch pathway on the decision tree. In conclusion, we present a 'justiceenhanced' framework that enables the incorporation of social justice concerns into traditional CEA for the evaluation of new regimens for MDR-TB.	stigma; human rights; economic evaluation; ethics; MDR-TB	TB-RELATED STIGMA; DETERMINANTS; HEALTH; BANGLADESH
10.1128_JCM.01013_17	The TB Portals: an Open-Access, Web-Based Platform for Global Drug-Resistant-Tuberculosis Data Sharing and Analysis	The TB Portals program is an international consortium of physicians, radiologists, and microbiologists from countries with a heavy burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis working with data scientists and information technology professionals. Together, we have built the TB Portals, a repository of socioeconomic/geographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and genomic data from patient cases of drug-resistant tuberculosis backed by shareable, physical samples. Currently, there are 1,299 total cases from five country sites (Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova, Georgia, and Romania), 976 (75.1%) of which are multidrug or extensively drug resistant and 38.2%, 51.9%, and 36.3% of which contain X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, and genomic data, respectively. The top Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineages represented among collected samples are Beijing, T1, and H3, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that confer resistance to isoniazid, rifampin, ofloxacin, and moxifloxacin occur the most frequently. These data and samples have promoted drug discovery efforts and research into genomics and quantitative image analysis to improve diagnostics while also serving as a valuable resource for researchers and clinical providers. The TB Portals database and associated projects are continually growing, and we invite new partners and collaborations to our initiative.

10.1016_j.kjms.2017.06.011	Genetic diversity of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated from tuberculosis patients in Iran using MIRU-VNTR technique	Tuberculosis (TB) is considered as one of the most important infectious diseases in the world, and recent rise and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains, have made the matter worsened. Due to the importance of TB prevalence in Iran, this study was designed to investigate the genetic diversity among MDR strains of MTB by MIRU-VNTR typing scheme. A total of 88 drug resistant M. tuberculosis isolates belong to pulmonary TB cases were collected from several TB reference centers of Iran. Drug susceptibility testing for Isoniazid and Rifampin was performed using the agar proportion method and MDR isolates were underwent genotyping by using 12-locus-based MIRU-VNTR typing. On performing proportion method, 22 isolates were identified as MDR. By typing of MDR isolates using 12-loci MIRU-VNTR technique, high diversity were demonstrated in MDR strains and these were classified into 20 distinct MIRU-VNTR genotypes. MIRU loci 10 and 26 were the most discriminatory loci with 8 and 7 alleles respectively; while MIRU loci 2, 20, 24 and 39 were found to be the least discriminatory with 1-2 alleles each. We noticed a mixed infection in isolate 53, as this isolate comprised simultaneous two alleles in MIRU loci 40, 10, 16 and 39. In conclusion, this result represents MIRU-VNTR typing as a useful tool for studying genetic diversity of MDR-MTB in regional settings, and will help the health sectors to construct a preventive program for MDR-TB. Additionally, it can detect mixed infection which can facilitate management of treatment. Copyright (C) 2017, Kaohsiung Medical University. Published by Elsevier Taiwan LLC.

10.1590_0074_02760170062	Correlation between the BACTEC MGIT 960 culture system with Genotype MTBDRplus and TB-SPRINT in multidrug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from Brazil	BACKGROUND The accurate detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is critical for the application of appropriate patient treatment and prevention of transmission of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. The goal of this study was to evaluate the correlation between phenotypic and molecular techniques for drug-resistant tuberculosis diagnostics. Molecular techniques used were the line probe assay genotype MTBDRplus and the recently described tuberculosis-spoligo-rifampin-isoniazid typing (TB-SPRINT) bead-based assay. Conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST) was done on a BACTEC (TM) MGIT 960 TB. METHOD We studied 80 M. tuberculosis complex (MTC) clinical isolates from Minas Gerais state, of which conventional DST had classified 60 isolates as MDR and 20 as drug susceptible. FINDINGS Among the 60 MDR-TB isolates with MGIT as a reference, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and kappa for rifampicin (RIF) resistance using TB-SPRINT and MTBDRplus, were 96.7% versus 93.3%, 100.0% versus 100.0%, 97.5% versus 95.0% and 0.94 versus 0.88, respectively. Similarly, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and kappa for isoniazid (INH) resistance were 85.0% and 83.3%, 100.0% and 100.0%, 88.8% and 87.5% and 0.74 and 0.71 for both tests, respectively. Finally, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and kappa for MDR-TB were 85.0% and 83.3%, 100.0% and 100.0%, 88.8% and 87.5% and 0.74 and 0.71 for both tests, respectively. MAIN CONCLUSIONS Both methods exhibited a good correlation with the conventional DST. We suggest estimating the cost-effectiveness of MTBDRplus and TB-SPRINT in Brazil.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; genotype; molecular	DRUG-RESISTANCE; ASSAY; CHALLENGES; MECHANISMS
10.7196_SAMJ.2017.v107i11.12577	Extraspinal osteoarticular multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in children: A case series	Background. South Africa (SA) is known to have a high disease burden of tuberculosis (TB). Extraspinal osteoarticular multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (ESOA MDR-TB) in children has only been described in a few case reports worldwide. Objectives. To describe the epidemiology and highlight the potential problem of ESOA MDR-TB infections as seen in children from a single academic hospital in SA. Methods. A retrospective record review was performed on all children diagnosed with ESOA TB infection at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Johannesburg, between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2015. All patients with a positive TB culture (fluid or tissue) from the surgical site of biopsy (bone or joint) and who were hospitalised were included. Organism culture and drug sensitivity testing were performed. Results. Overall 19 cases of ESOA TB were identified. Areas involved included the shoulder (2 cases), elbow (2 cases), hip (7 cases), knee (4 cases), ankle (3 cases) and humerus (1 case). The mean age of the population was 7.7 (range 2.0 - 14.0) years. The mean white cell count was 11.3 (range 5 - 28.9) x 10(9)/L, the mean C-reactive protein level 53.8 (range 1.0 - 364.0) mg/L and the mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate 35.5 (range 4.0 - 85.0) mm/h. Two cases (10.5%) were MDR, and a further case (5.3%) was resistant to isoniazid only. Four of 12 patients tested positive for HIV. One of the HIV-positive patients was isoniazid resistant. The two positive ESOA MDR-TB cases are discussed in detail. Conclusions. These findings indicate that ESOA MDR-TB is a reality in this paediatric population (10.5%) and a high index of suspicion should be maintained, especially when cultures are negative in children with signs and symptoms of ESOA TB. The effect of HIV infection on the incidence of ESOA MDR-TB requires further study.		MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; SOUTH-AFRICA; INFECTION; EPIDEMIC; SURGERY; CAPE
10.1111_lam.12787	GenoType MTBDRplus assay for screening and characterization of isoniazid and rifampicin resistance-associated mutations in multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis from India	Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is rising and the World Health Organization has recommended the line probe assay (LPA) for screening. In this study we assess LPA at a tertiary care centre from North India in 1758 samples from suspected MDR-TB cases. All smear-positive and/or Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture confirmed cases (n = 1170) were subjected to the GenoType-MTBDR assay. Amongst these the majority were retreatment cases, smear-positive at diagnosis (n = 637). An MDR prevalence of 7.8% was observed with the highest cases reported amongst MDR contacts (33.3%). The most common rifampicin resistance encoding mutation seen overall and in individual patient groups was H531L (53.3%). A higher prevalence of H526D mutation was observed in retreatment cases, smear-positive at 4 months of anti-tubercular therapy vs other patient groups (P = 0.052). The most common mutation encoding isoniazid resistance was S315T1 in the katG (79.9%) and C-15T in the inhA gene (91.1%). Thirty rifampicin and nine isoniazid resistant isolates had wild type gene deletion but no detectable mutation by LPA. Although LPA is a practical and rapid screening method for most mutations expected to result in MDR-TB, we observed that it only detects the known major mutations in specific genes. Such studies can provide the knowledge required to formulate customized strips based on prevalent mutations in our region and in specific patient groups.	line probe assay; multi drug resistance; mutations; rapid; tuberculosis	DRUG-RESISTANCE; RPOB MUTATIONS; PREVALENCE; RIFABUTIN; COMPLEX
10.3346_jkms.2017.32.11.1779	Submillisievert Computed Tomography of the Chest in Contact Investigation for Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Close contacts with infectious tuberculosis (TB) are persons at high risk for developing active disease. We preliminarily introduced submillisievert chest computed tomography (CT) scan (effective dose, 0.19-0.25 millisievert) in a contact investigation of multi-drug resistant (MDR)-TB. Baseline CT scan showed minimal nodules or branching opacities in two of six contacts. A two-month follow-up examination revealed a radiologic progression in contact 1, subsequently having the microbiologic diagnosis of MDR-TB at an asymptomatic early stage, whereas nodules transiently increased after 3 months in contact 2, followed by a decrease after one year. Contact 1 was cured after 1.5-year of anti-MDRTB treatment. In conclusion, early identification of secondary MDR-TB is feasible with submillisievert chest CT scans in contact investigations of MDR-TB, minimizing of MDR-TB transmission and offering a favorable treatment outcome.

10.1093_cid_cix561	Epidemiology of Pediatric Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in the United States, 1993-2014	Background. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is an important global public health threat, but accurate estimates of MDR-TB burden among children are lacking. Methods. We analyzed demographic, clinical, and laboratory data for newly diagnosed pediatric (age < 15 years) TB cases reported to the US National TB Surveillance System during 1993-2014. MDR-TB was defined as culture-confirmed TB disease with resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. To ascertain potential underestimation of pediatric MDR-TB, we surveyed high-burden states for clinically diagnosed cases treated for MDR-TB. Results. Of 20 789 pediatric TB cases, 5162 (24.8%) had bacteriologically confirmed TB. Among 4826 (93.5%) with drug susceptibility testing, 82 (1.7%) had MDR-TB. Most pediatric MDR-TB cases were female (n = 51 [62%]), median age was 5 years (interquartile range, 1-12 years), one-third were Hispanic (n = 28 [34%]), and two-thirds (n = 55 [67%]) were born in the United States. Most cases had additional resistance to = 1 other first-line drug (n = 66 [81%]) and one-third had resistance to = 1 second-line drug (24/73 tested). Of 77 who started treatment prior to 2013, 66 (86%) completed treatment and 4 (5%) died. Among the 4 high-TB-burden states/jurisdictions surveyed, there was 42%-55% underestimation of pediatric MDR-TB cases when using only culture-confirmed case definitions. Conclusions. Only one-quarter of pediatric TB cases had culture-confirmed TB, likely resulting in underestimation of true pediatric MDR-TB burden in the United States using strictly bacteriologic criteria. Better estimates of pediatric MDR-TB burden in the United States are needed and should include clinical diagnoses based on epidemiologic criteria.	tuberculosis; pediatric; antimicrobial resistance; multidrug resistance	CHILDHOOD TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; CLINICAL-FEATURES; CHILDREN; METAANALYSIS; OUTCOMES; THERAPY
10.1111_ijd.13708	The role of DNA polymerase chain reaction, culture and histopathology in the diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis	Background Cutaneous tuberculosis (TB) is re-emerging as a significant problem in India due to increased incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), other immunosuppressive states/ factors like drugs, and emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR-TB). Proper diagnosis is warranted as there is varied clinical presentation and similarity with many other diseases. Objective To assess the sensitivities of DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture, and histopathology for the diagnosis of cutaneous TB in clinically suspected skin lesions. Methods Clinically suspected cases of cutaneous TB were enrolled in the study. Two skin punch biopsies were taken from each patient and sent for histopathology examination and DNA PCR with culture, respectively. Results Of the total 70 cases enrolled, 49 were detected as cutaneous TB by the above tests. The sensitivities of DNA PCR, culture, and histopathology were 24.5, 16.3, and 91.8%, respectively. Conclusion DNA PCR and culture should be advised in cases of cutaneous TB with inconclusive histopathology. DNA PCR should be considered in preference over culture if facilities are available as it gives rapid results and has a higher sensitivity.

10.1371_journal.pone.0187211	Half of rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolated from tuberculosis patients in Sub-Saharan Africa have concomitant resistance to pyrazinamide	Background Besides inclusion in 1st line regimens against tuberculosis (TB), pyrazinamide (PZA) is used in 2nd line anti-TB regimens, including in the short regimen for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients. Guidelines and expert opinions are contradictory about inclusion of PZA in case of resistance. Moreover, drug susceptibility testing (DST) for PZA is not often applied in routine testing, and the prevalence of resistance is unknown in several regions, including in most African countries. Methods Six hundred and twenty-three culture isolates from rifampicin-resistant (RR) patients were collected in twelve Sub-Saharan African countries. Among those isolates, 71% were from patients included in the study on the Union short-course regimen for MDR-TB in Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central Africa Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Niger, and Rwanda PZA resistance, and the rest (29%) were consecutive isolates systematically stored from 2014-2015 in Mali, Rwanda, Senegal, and Togo. Besides national guidelines, the isolates were tested for PZA resistance through pncA gene sequencing. Results Over half of these RR-TB isolates (54%) showed a mutation in the pncA gene, with a significant heterogeneity between countries. Isolates with fluoroquinolone resistance (but not with injectable resistance or XDR) were more likely to have concurrent PZA resistance. The pattern of mutations in the pncA gene was quite diverse, although some isolates with an identical pattern of mutations in pncA and other drug-related genes were isolated from the same reference center, suggesting possible transmission of these strains. Conclusion Similar to findings in other regions, more than half of the patients having RR-TB in West and Central Africa present concomitant resistance to PZA. Further investigations are needed to understand the relation between resistance to PZA and resistance to fluoroquinolones, and whether continued use of PZA in the face of PZA resistance provides clinical benefit to the patients.

10.1093_cid_cix556	Fluoroquinolone Resistance Mutation Detection Is Equivalent to Culture-Based Drug Sensitivity Testing for Predicting Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment Outcome: A Retrospective Cohort Study	"Background. Molecular diagnostics that rapidly and accurately predict fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance promise to improve treatment outcomes for individuals with multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB). Mutations in the gyr genes, though, can cause variable levels of in vitro FQ resistance, and some in vitro resistance remains unexplained by gyr mutations alone, but the implications of these discrepancies for treatment outcome are unknown. Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 172 subjects with MDR/extensively drug-resistant TB subjects and sequenced the full gyrA and gyrB open reading frames in their respective sputum TB isolates. The gyr mutations were classified into 2 categories: a set of mutations that encode high-level FQ resistance and a second set that encodes intermediate resistance levels. We constructed a Cox proportional model to assess the effect of the gyr mutation type on the time to death or treatment failure and compared this with in vitro FQ resistance, controlling for host and treatment factors. Results. Controlling for other host and treatment factors and compared with patients with isolates without gyr resistance mutations, ""high- level"" gyr mutations significantly predict poor treatment outcomes with a hazard ratio of 2.6 (1.2-5.6). We observed a hazard of death and treatment failure with ""intermediate- level"" gyr mutations of 1.3 (0.6-3.1), which did not reach statistical significance. The gyr mutations were not different than culture-based FQ drug susceptibility testing in predicting the hazard of death or treatment failure and may be superior. Conclusions. FQ molecular-based diagnostic tests may better predict treatment response than traditional drug susceptibility testing and open avenues for personalizing TB therapy."

10.1371_journal.pone.0181797	Spatial distribution of extensively drugresistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) patients in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa	Background KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, has among the highest burden of XDR TB worldwide with the majority of cases occurring due to transmission. Poor access to health facilities can be a barrier to timely diagnosis and treatment of TB, which can contribute to ongoing transmission. We sought to determine the geographic distribution of XDR TB patients and proximity to health facilities in KwaZulu-Natal. Methods We recruited adults and children with XDR TB diagnosed in KwaZulu-Natal. We calculated distance and time from participants' home to the closest hospital or clinic, as well as to the actual facility that diagnosed XDR TB, using tools within ArcGIS Network analyst. Speed of travel was assigned to road classes based on Department of Transport regulations. Results were compared to guidelines for the provision of social facilities in South Africa: 5km to a clinic and 30km to a hospital. Results During 2011-2014, 1027 new XDR TB cases were diagnosed throughout all 11 districts of KwaZulu-Natal, of whom 404 (39%) were enrolled and had geospatial data collected. Participants would have had to travel a mean distance of 2.9 km (CI 95%: 1.8-4.1) to the nearest clinic and 17.6 km (CI 95%: 11.4-23.8) to the nearest hospital. Actual distances that participants travelled to the health facility that diagnosed XDR TB ranged from < 10 km (n = 143, 36%) to > 50 km (n = 109, 27%), with a mean of 69 km. The majority (77%) of participants travelled farther than the recommended distance to a clinic (5 km) and 39% travelled farther than the recommended distance to a hospital (30 km). Nearly half (46%) of participants were diagnosed at a health facility in eThekwini district, of whom, 36% resided outside the Durban metropolitan area. Conclusions XDR TB cases are widely distributed throughout KwaZulu-Natal province with a denser focus in eThekwini district. Patients travelled long distances to the health facility where they were diagnosed with XDR TB, suggesting a potential role for migration or transportation in the XDR TB epidemic.

10.1093_infdis_jix391	Using Patient Pathway Analysis to Design Patient-centered Referral Networks for Diagnosis and Treatment of Tuberculosis: The Case of the Philippines	Background. Tuberculosis (TB) is the 8th leading cause of death in the Philippines. A recent prevalence survey found that there were nearly 70% more cases of tuberculosis than previously estimated. Given these new data, the National TB Program (NTP), operating through a decentralized health system, identified about 58% of the estimated new drug-sensitive (DS) TB patients in 2016. However, the NTP only identified and commenced treatment for around 17% of estimated new drug-resistant patients. In order to reach the remaining 42% of drug-sensitive patients and 83% of drug-resistant patients, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of where patients seek care. Methods. National and regional patient pathway analyses (PPAs) were undertaken using existing national survey and NTP data. The PPA assessed the alignment between patient care seeking and the availability of TB diagnostic and treatment services. Results. Systemic referral networks from the community-level Barangay Health Stations (BHSs) to diagnostic facilities have enabled more efficient detection of drug-sensitive tuberculosis in the public sector. Approximately 36% of patients initiated care in the private sector, where there is limited coverage of appropriate diagnostic technologies. Important differences in the alignment between care seeking patterns and diagnostic and treatment availability were found between regions. Conclusions. The PPA identified opportunities for strengthening access to care for all forms of tuberculosis and for accelerating the time to diagnosis by aligning services to where patients initiate care. Geographic variations in care seeking may guide prioritization of some regions for intensified engagement with the private sector.	tuberculosis; patient pathway analysis; MDR-TB; care seeking; diagnosis	
10.1016_j.rmed.2017.08.002	Treatment outcomes of rifampin-sparing treatment in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis with rifampin-mono-resistance or rifampin adverse events: A retrospective cohort analysis	Background: Rifampin (RIF) mono-resistant tuberculosis (RMR-TB) is a rare disease. Current guidelines recommend that RMR-TB be treated as multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) but the evidence is scarce. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on pulmonary TB patients to investigate the characteristics and outcomes of RMR-TB. The characteristics of RMR-TB were compared with those with adverse events to rifampin (RAE-TB). Results: Forty-four RMR-TB and 29 RAE-TB patients were enrolled. RMR-TB patients showed more alcohol use, prior history of TB, and radiologically severe disease, while RAE-TB patients were older and had more comorbidities and combined extrapulmonary TB. A fluoroquinolone (FQ) was the drug most commonly added (70.5%, RMR-TB; 82.8%, RAE-TB). Median treatment duration was 453 days in RMR-TB and 371 days in RAE-TB (p = 0.001) and treatment success rates were 87.2% (34/39) and 80.0% (20/25), respectively (p = 0.586). Subanalysis of the RMR-TB group by treatment regimen (standard regimen [n = 11], standard regimen FQ En = 12], MDR-TB regimen [n = 21]) revealed a higher rate of radio logically severe disease in the MDR-TB subgroup, with similar treatment success rates for the subgroups (85.7% [6/7]), 91.7% [11/12], and 85.0% [17/20], respectively) despite different durations of treatment (345, 405, and 528 days, respectively). Two recurrences (33.3% [2/61) developed only in standard regimen subgroup, suggesting that standard regimen is not enough to treat RMR-TB patients. Conclusions: The treatment outcome of RMR-TB with 1st-line drugs + FQwas comparable to that of MDR-TB regimen. Shorter treatment duration may be considered for RMR-TB patients compared with MDR-TB patients. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

10.1017_S0950268817001911	Predicting treatment failure, death and drug resistance using a computed risk score among newly diagnosed TB patients in Tamaulipas, Mexico	The purpose of this study was to develop a method for identifying newly diagnosed tuberculosis (TB) patients at risk for TB adverse events in Tamaulipas, Mexico. Surveillance data between 2006 and 2013 (8431 subjects) was used to develop risk scores based on predictive modelling. The final models revealed that TB patients failing their treatment regimen were more likely to have at most a primary school education, multi-drug resistance (MDR)-TB, and few to moderate bacilli on acid-fast bacilli smear. TB patients who died were more likely to be older males with MDR-TB, HIV, malnutrition, and reporting excessive alcohol use. Modified risk scores were developed with strong predictability for treatment failure and death (c-statistic 0.65 and 0.70, respectively), and moderate predictability for drug resistance (c-statistic 0.57). Among TB patients with diabetes, risk scores showed moderate predictability for death (c-statistic 0.68). Our findings suggest that in the clinical setting, the use of our risk scores for TB treatment failure or death will help identify these individuals for tailored management to prevent these adverse events. In contrast, the available variables in the TB surveillance dataset are not robust predictors of drug resistance, indicating the need for prompt testing at time of diagnosis.

10.1093_heapol_czx041	Are scientific research outputs aligned with national policy makers' priorities? A case study of tuberculosis in Cambodia	With funding for tuberculosis (TB) research decreasing, and the high global disease burden persisting, there are calls for increased investment in TB research. However, justification of such investments is questionable, when translation of research outputs into policy and health care improvements remains a challenge for TB and other diseases. Using TB in Cambodia as a case study, we investigate how evidence needs of national policy makers are addressed by topics covered in research publications. We first conducted a systematic review to compile all studies on TB in Cambodia published since 2000. We then identified priority areas in which evidence for policy and programme planning are required from the perspective of key national TB control stakeholders. Finally, results from the literature review were analysed in relation to the priority research areas for national policy makers to assess overlap and highlight gaps in evidence. Priority research areas were: TB-HIV co-infection; childhood TB; multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB); and universal and equitable access to quality diagnosis and treatment. On screening 1687 unique papers retrieved from our literature search, 253 were eligible publications focusing on TB in Cambodia. Of these, only 73 (29%) addressed one of the four priority research areas. Overall, 30 (11%), five (2%), seven (2%) and 37 (14%) studies reported findings relevant to TB-HIV, childhood TB, MDR-TB and access to quality diagnosis and treatment respectively. Our analysis shows that a small proportion of the research outputs in Cambodia address priority areas for informing policy and programme planning. This case study illustrates that there is substantial room for improvement in alignment between research outputs and evidence gaps that national policy makers would like to see addressed; better coordination between researchers, funders and policy makers' on identifying priority research topics may increase the relevance of research findings to health policies and programmes.

10.1093_heapol_czx093	Preventing emergence of drug resistant tuberculosis in Myanmar's transitioning health system	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a particular threat to the populations of resource-limited countries. Although inadequate treatment of TB has been identified as a major underlying cause of drug resistance, essential information to inform changes in health service delivery and policy is missing. We investigate factors that may be driving the emergence of MDR-TB in Myanmar, a country where investment and health system reforms are ongoing to address the unexplained, high occurrence of MDR-TB. We conducted a multi-centre, retrospective case-control study in 10 townships across Yangon. Cases were 202 GeneXpert-confirmed MDR-TB patients with a history of prior first-line treatment for TB. Controls were 404 previously untreated smear-microscopy confirmed TB patients who had no evidence of resistance to anti-TB drugs. Information on patient and health service factors was collected through face-to-face patient interviews and hospital record reviews. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that the following TB patient groups are at higher risk of developing MDR-TB after initial TB treatment: those who have diabetes (aOR 2.10; 95% CI 1.17-3.76), those who missed taking drugs during the initial treatment more than once weekly (aOR 2.35; 95% CI 1.18-4.65) and those with a higher socioeconomic (aOR 1.99; 95% CI 1.09-3.63) or educational status (aOR 1.78; 95% CI1.01-3.13). Coinciding with a surge in funding to improve health in Myanmar, this study identifies practices of patients and healthcare organizations that can be addressed, and high-risk TB patient groups that can be prioritized for treatment support. Specifically, the study shows that TB patients who experience frequent, short interruptions in treatment and those with diabetes may require enhanced treatment support and monitoring by health services in order to prevent further generation of drug resistance.

10.1111_tmi.12934	Feasibility of a new model for early detection of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in a developed setting of eastern China	OBJECTIVES The poor detection rate of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) highlights the urgent need to explore new case finding model to improve the detection of MDR-TB in China. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a new model that combines molecular diagnostics and sputum transportation for early detection of patients with MDR-TB in Zhejiang. METHODS From May 2014 to January 2015, TB suspects were continuously enrolled at six county-level designated TB hospitals in Zhejiang. Each patient gave three sputum samples, which were submitted to laboratory for smear microscopy, solid culture and GeneXpert. The specimens from rifampin (RIF)-resistant cases detected by GeneXpert, and positive cultures were transported from county-level to prefecture-level laboratories for line probe analysis (LPA) and drug susceptibility testing (DST). The performance and interval of MDR-TB detection of the new model were compared with those of conventional model. RESULTS A total of 3151 sputum specimens were collected from TB suspects. The sensitivity of GeneXpert for detecting culture-positive cases was 92.7% (405/437), and its specificity was 91.3% (2428/2659). Of 16 RIF-resistant cases detected by DST, GeneXpert could correctly identify 15 cases, yielding a sensitivity of 93.8% (15/16). The specificity of GeneXpert for detecting RIF susceptibility was 100.0% (383/383). The average interval to diagnosis of the conventional DST model was 56.5 days, ranging from 43 to 71 days, which was significantly longer than that of GeneXpert plus LPA (22.2 days, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Our data demonstrate that the combination of improved molecular TB tests and sputum transportation could significantly shorten the time required for detection of MDR-TB, which will bring benefits for preventing an epidemic of MDR-TB in this high-prevalence setting.	tuberculosis; multidrug resistance; feasibility; detection	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MULTICENTER EVALUATION; NATIONAL-SURVEY; DIAGNOSIS
10.1016_j.diagmicrobio.2017.06.018	Direct detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and drug resistance in respiratory specimen using Abbott Realtime MTB detection and RIF/INH resistance assay	"Abbott RealTime MTB (Abbott-RT) in conjunction with Abbott RealTime MTB RIF/INH Resistance (Abbott-RIF/ [NH) is a new, high-throughput automated nucleic acid amplification platform (Abbott-MDR) for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and the genotypic markers for rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) resistance directly from respiratory specimens. This prospective study evaluated the diagnostic performance of this new platform for MTBC and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) using 610 sputum specimens in a tuberculosis high-burden setting. Using conventional culture results and clinical background as reference standards, Abbott-RT exhibited an overall sensitivity and specificity of 95.2% and 99.8%, respectively. Genotypic RIF/INH resistance of 178 ""MTB detected"" specimens was subsequently analyzed by Abbott-RIF/ INH. Compared to phenotypic drug susceptibility test results, Abbott-RIF/INH detected resistance genotypic markers in 84.6% MDR-TB, 80% mono-RIF-resistant and 66.7% mono-INH-resistant specimens. Two of the RIF-resistant specimens carried a novel single, nonsense mutation at rpoB Q513 and in silico simulation demonstrated that the truncated RpoB protein failed to bind with other subunits for transcription. Overall, Abbott-MDR platform provided high throughput and reliable diagnosis of MDR-TB within a TB high-burden region. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

10.1016_j.ijid.2017.06.010	High diversity of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Central Asian Strain isolates in Nepal	Objectives: Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) poses a major public health problem in Nepal. Although it has been reported as one of the dominant genotypes of MTB in Nepal, little information on the Central Asian Strain (CAS) family is available, especially isolates related to multidrug resistance (MDR) cases. This study aimed to elucidate the genetic and epidemiological characteristics of MDR CAS isolates in Nepal. Methods: A total of 145 MDR CAS isolates collected in Nepal from 2008 to 2013 were characterized by spoligotyping, mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) analysis, and drug resistance-associated gene sequencing. Results: Spoligotyping analysis showed CAS1_Delhi SIT26 as predominant (60/145, 41.4%). However, by combining spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR typing, it was possible to successfully discriminate all 145 isolates into 116 different types including 18 clusters with 47 isolates (clustering rate 32.4%). About a half of these clustered isolates shared the same genetic and geographical characteristics with other isolates in each cluster, and some of them shared rare point mutations in rpoB that are thought to be associated with rifampicin resistance. Conclusions: Although the data obtained show little evidence that large outbreaks of MDR-TB caused by the CAS family have occurred in Nepal, they strongly suggest several MDR-MTB transmission cases.

10.1016_j.ijid.2017.07.025	Drug adherence and efficacy of smear microscopy in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis after 2 months of medication in North-western Tanzania	Objectives: The study aimed at assessing the Tuberculosis (TB) medication adherence level and the efficacy of smear microscopy in the diagnosing pulmonary TB at month 2. Methods: A prospective study was conducted at the four sites located in the Northern-western Tanzania. New smear positive, pulmonary TB patients were followed up and their adherence to TB medication assessed after 2 months of the treatment. In addition, the acid fast bacilli (AFB) smear microscopy was performed after 2 and 5 months of the treatment. All smear positive samples were subjected to geneXpert (MTB/RIF) assay and culture on the Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) media. Results: A total of 331 smear positive, newly diagnosed patients with pulmonary TB were enrolled. The median age was 36 [Interquartile range (IQR): 28-45] years and males formed the slightly majority, 187 (56.5%) of the participants. A total of 105 (31.7%) patients were infected with HIV. Out of 331 patients, 36 (10.9%) were still AFB smear positive at the end of two month. Of these 19 (52.8%) were positive on GeneXpert MTB RIF and none was Rifampicin resistant. Of note, only 13 (31.1%) were culture positive (viable). None of the patients was positive at month 5. Poor adherence to TB medications in the first 2 months of treatment was observed in 56/331 (16.9%) [95% CI = 12.9-21.0] of the patients. Conclusion: Over two thirds of smear positive patients are wrongly put in one month extension of the intensive phase treatment; this may cause increased costs and drug toxicity. Culture should be advocated to confirm smear positivity after 2 months of medications. TB treatment drug adherence in our setting is good and is associated with successful cure. No multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) was observed. Continued surveillance and emphasizing of TB drug adherence should be kept upbeat in order to control tuberculosis in developing countries.

10.5588_ijtld.16.0939	Drug resistance patterns among extra-pulmonary tuberculosis cases in a tertiary care centre in North India	BACKGROUND: Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) is a growing public health concern, and data on drug resistance are limited. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Specimens from 2468 clinically diagnosed EPTB patients received at the Intermediate Reference Laboratory (IRL) of a tertiary centre in India were subjected to Ziehl-Neelsen staining, Xpert (R) MTB/RIF testing, liquid culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) using automated BACTEC MGIT (TM) 960 (TM). Line-probe assay (LPA) was performed on all culture-positive isolates. Gene sequencing was performed on rifampicin-resistant/multidrug-resistant TB (RR/MDR-TB) and phenotypic/genotypic discrepant isolates. RESULTS: The culture positivity rate was 18.9% (483/2553). The sensitivity and specificity of Xpert in diagnosing EPTB were respectively 70.8% (95%CI 66.5-74.8) and 97.7% (95 %CI 96.9-98.3), with liquid culture as the reference standard. Prevalence of RR/MDR-TB was 10.1% (49/483). Prevalence of pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR-TB) was 18.4% (09/49), whereas the prevalence of XDR-TB among MDR-TB patients was 2% (01/49). The sensitivity of genotypic DST for the detection of rifampicin resistance was 92.7% (95%CI 81.1-98.5) and specificity was 99.3% (95%CI 97.5-99.9), with 100% concordance between Xpert and LPA. CONCLUSION: The burden of drug resistance, including M/XDR-TB, among EPTB patients is high. Novel molecular tests can help in early diagnosis and treatment to prevent disease progression and amplification of resistance.

10.1186_s12879_017_2746_5	Predictors of unsuccessful interim treatment outcomes of multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients	Background: Interim treatment outcomes at 6-months for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment are among the most basic performance monitoring and key evaluation indicators in the Stop and End TB strategy of the World Health Organization (WHO). Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the interim treatment outcomes of MDR-TB patients in Pakistan. Methods: This study was conducted at the Programmatic Management Unit for Drug-resistance TB (PMDT) site of the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP), Pakistan. It is located in the Chest Disease Unit (CDU) of the Bahawal Victoria Hospital (BVH), Bahawalpur, Punjab, Pakistan. Data was collected between April 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015. The medical records, Electronic Nominal Recording Reporting System (ENRS) data and MRD-TB notification forms of the MDR-TB patients registered at the PMDT site were reviewed to obtain data. For reporting and calculation of interim treatment outcomes, standardized WHO methodology was adopted. Simple logistic regression analysis was used to examine the possible association between the dependent variable (i.e. unsuccessful interim treatment outcome) and selected socio-demographic and clinical variables. Results: A total of 100 drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) patients (all types) were registered during the study period. Out of these, 80 were MDR-TB patients for whom interim results were available. Out of the 80 MDR-TB cases, 48 (60%) were classified under the successful interim treatment outcome category. The remaining 40% had unsuccessful 6-month treatment outcomes and 12 (15%) patients died, while nine (11.3%) were lost to follow-up by six months. The final predictors of unsuccessful interim treatment outcomes were; being resistant to ofloxacin (AOR 3.23, 95% CI 0.96-10. 89; p-value = 0.04), having above normal baseline serum creatinine levels (AOR 6.49, 95% CI 1.39-30.27; p-value = 0.02), and being culture positive at the second month of treatment (AOR 6.94, 95% CI 2-24.12; p-value = 0.01). Conclusions: Despite free treatment and programmatic efforts to ensure patient adherence, the high rate of unsuccessful interim treatment outcomes is concerning. The identified risk factors for unsuccessful interim treatment outcomes in the current study provides clinicians an opportunity to identify high-risk patients and ensure enhanced clinical management and greater treatment success rates.

The preliminary results showed that all the targets (MIC: 0.10-8 mu g/mL) exhibited excellent inhibitory activity against MTB H37Rv and MDR-TB, but eight of them (CC50: 7.8-62.5 gimp were much more toxic than the parent GTFX (CC50: 125,agimL). Among them, 5g (MIC: 0.10 mu g/mL) was 4-8 times more potent in vitro than the references GTFX (MIC: 0.78 mu g/mL) and RIF (MIC: 0.39 mu g/mL) against MTB H37Rv, but less active than INH (MIC: 0.05, mu g/mL). The most potent 5g and 5h (MIC: 0.25 mu g/mL) were 4->512 times more active than the three references (MIC: 1.0->128 mu g/mL) against MDR-TB. Unfortunately, both of the two hybrids (CC50: 7.8 mu g/mL) were much more cytotoxic than the other derivatives, need to be further optimized. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

10.1371_journal.pone.0184510	Whole-genome sequencing illuminates the evolution and spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Southwest Nigeria	Nigeria has an emerging problem with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Whole-genome sequencing was used to understand the epidemiology of tuberculosis and genetics of multi-drug resistance among patients from two tertiary referral centers in Southwest Nigeria. In line with previous molecular epidemiology studies, most isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from this dataset belonged to the Cameroon clade within the Euro-American lineage. Phylogenetic analysis showed this clade was undergoing clonal expansion in this region, and suggests that it was involved in community transmission of sensitive and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Five patients enrolled for retreatment were infected with pre-extensively drug resistant (pre-XDR) due to fluoroquinolone resistance in isolates from the Cameroon clade. In all five cases resistance was conferred through a mutation in the gyrA gene. In some patients, genomic changes occurred in bacterial isolates during the course of treatment that potentially led to decreased drug susceptibility. We conclude that inter-patient transmission of resistant isolates, principally from the Cameroon clade, contributes to the spread of MDR-TB in this setting, underscoring the urgent need to curb the spread of multidrug resistance in this region.

10.3389_fmicb.2017.01768	Rifabutin Resistance Associated with Double Mutations in rpoB Gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates	The objective of this study was to investigate the cross-resistance between rifampin (RIF) and rifabutin (RFB) among clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates, and the correlations between specific rpoB mutations and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of RIF and RFB. A total of 256 RIF-resistant isolates were included from the National Tuberculosis Clinical Laboratory in China. The MICs of MTB isolates against RIF and RFB were determined by using a microplate alamarBlue assay. In addition, all the MTB isolates were sequenced for mutations in rpoB gene. 204 out of 256 isolates (79.7%) were resistant to RFB, whereas 52 (20.3%) were susceptible to RFB. RIF-resistant/INH-susceptible (RR) group had a significant lower proportion of RFB-resistance than MDR-(P = 0.04) and XDR-TB group (P < 0.01). DNA sequencing revealed that there were 218 isolates (85.2%) with a single mutation, 26 (10.1%) with double mutations, and 12 (4.7%) without mutation in rpoB gene. Notably, although the single substitution of Leu511Pro, Asp516Gly, and His526Asn did not result in RFB resistance, 77.8% (7/9) of the MTB isolates with these double mutations became resistant to RFB. Compared with RR group (38.9%, 7/18), MDR-TB (63.5%, 106/167) had significantly higher proportion of isolates with mutations in codon 531 of rpoB gene (P = 0.04). Our data demonstrate that various rpoB mutations are associated with differential resistance to RIF and RFB. A single specific mutation in codons 511, 516, 526, and 533 was linked to the susceptibility to RFB for MTB, while the strains with these double mutations irrelevantly conferring RFB resistance produced RFB-resistant phenotype.	tuberculosis; rifabutin; rpoB; double mutations; rifampicin	RIFAMPIN RESISTANCE; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; RNA-POLYMERASE; BETA-SUBUNIT; RAPID DETECTION; STRAINS; RIFAMYCINS; EFFICACY; COMPLEX
10.4103_0366_6999.213413	Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis Burden among the New Tuberculosis Patients in Zhejiang Province: An Observational Study, 2009-2013	Background: Screening on multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has been limited to the serious TB subpopulations excluding the new TB patients. This study aimed to examine MDR-TB burden among the new TB patients. Methods: We conducted a study in Zhejiang Province during 2009-2013 to screen for MDR-TB patients among the low MDR-TB risk patients and five subpopulations of high MDR-TB risk patients. The number, prevalence, and trend of MDR-TB were compared while the logistic regression model was used to examine risk factors related to MDR-TB. Results: A total of 200 and 791 MDR-TB cases were, respectively, identified from the 9830 new TB cases and 2372 high-risk suspects who took MDR-TB screening from 2009 to 2013. The MDR-TB rates went down in both of the new TB patients and five MDR-TB high-risk groups over the study time, but the percentage of MDR-TB patients identified from the new TB patients in all diagnosed MDR-TB cases kept stable from 28.3% in 2011 to 27.0% in 2012 to 26.0% in 2013. Conclusions: The study indicated that MDR-TB burden among new TB patients was high, thus screening for MDR-TB among the new TB patients should be recommended in China as well as in the similar situation worldwide.

10.1128_AAC.02586_16	Adverse Effects and Choice between the Injectable Agents Amikacin and Capreomycin in Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	The prolonged use of injectable agents in a regimen for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is recommended by the World Health Organization, despite its association with ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. We undertook this study to look at the relative adverse effects of capreomycin and amikacin. We reviewed the case notes of 100 consecutive patients treated at four MDR-TB treatment centers in the United Kingdom. The median total duration of treatment with an injectable agent was 178 days (interquartile range [IQR], 109 to 192 days; n = 73) for those with MDR-TB, 179 days (IQR, 104 to 192 days; n = 12) for those with MDR-TB plus fluoroquinolone resistance, and 558 days (IQR, 324 to 735 days; n = 8) for those with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). Injectable use was longer for those started with capreomycin (183 days; IQR, 123 to 197 days) than those started with amikacin (119 days; IQR, 83 to 177 days) (P = 0.002). Excluding patients with XDR-TB, 51 of 85 (60%) patients were treated with an injectable for over 6 months and 12 of 85 (14%) were treated with an injectable for over 8 months. Forty percent of all patients discontinued the injectable due to hearing loss. Fifty-five percent of patients experienced ototoxicity, which was 5 times (hazard ratio [HR], 5.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 22.6; P = 0.03) more likely to occur in those started on amikacin than in those treated with capreomycin only. Amikacin was associated with less hypokalemia than capreomycin (odds ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.72), with 5 of 37 (14%) patients stopping capreomycin due to recurrent electrolyte loss. There was no difference in the number of patients experiencing a rise in the creatinine level of >1.5 times the baseline level. Hearing loss is frequent in this cohort, though its incidence is significantly lower in those starting capreomycin, which should be given greater consideration as a first-line agent.	antibiotic resistance; antimicrobial safety; tuberculosis	INDUCED HEARING-LOSS; OTOTOXICITY; KANAMYCIN; EFFICACY; TB
10.7705_biomedica.v34i2.3437	Diagnostic accuracy of three technologies for the diagnosis of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis	Introduction: Multi-drug resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR-TB) tuberculoses are a global public health problem. Their timely detection might reduce the burden of the disease and the economic impact on health systems worldwide. Objective: To conduct a literature review of the diagnostic accuracy of three molecular tests to detect multi-drug resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculoses. Materials and methods: A systematic literature review following Cochrane methodology was carried out to study the diagnostic accuracy of three molecular tests to detect MDR-TB and XDR-TB in previous studies among immunocompetent population. Articles indexed in Medline and Embase were reviewed starting in 2007. Diagnostic accuracy was reported by sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of each test. Results: In total, 8, 12 and 13 studies were included to assess the diagnostic accuracy of GeneXpert MTB/RIF (R), GenoType MTBDRplus (R) and GenoType MTBDRsl (R), respectively. The specificity of GeneXpert MTB/RIF (R) ranged between 91 and 100%, and its sensitivity between 33.3 and 100%. The sensitivity of GenoType (R) MTBDRplus (R) ranged between 88 and 100%. The sensitivity and specificity of GenoType MTBDRsl (R) to evaluate drug resistance ranged between 56 and 100% and 21 and 100%, respectively. Conclusion: The three diagnostic tests evaluated have shown an adequate diagnostic accuracy to detect MDR and XDR tuberculoses.

10.1590_0037_8682_0465_2016	The importance of audiometric monitoring in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Introduction: A total of 771 cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were reported in Brazil in 2014. Treatment of MDR-TB with aminoglycosides can produce serious side effects such as permanent and irreversible hearing loss, which occurs in 5-64% of cases, and severely compromise patient quality of life. The goal of this research was to evaluate auditory and vestibular side effects in patients treated for MDR-TB and to identify associations between these complaints and the type of aminoglycoside used. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 599 medical records from patients with MDR-TB who were treated at the Helio Fraga/Fiocruz Reference Center between 2006 and 2010. Cases without auditory or vestibular complaints and patients who were not treated with aminoglycoside drugs were excluded from the study. Results: Of 164 eligible cases, 55 (33.5%) reported an auditory or vestibular complaint and medication was subsequently suspended, although hearing damage was not confirmed in all cases. Audiometric testing confirmed hearing loss in 11 (21.7%) of 12 cases submitted for evaluation. Hearing loss related to ototoxicity was confirmed in 15 (62.5%) cases. Tinnitus was significantly associated with the use of amikacin and streptomycin. Conclusions: Evaluations of ototoxicity symptoms were not usually reported in the routine care of patients with MDR-TB. Complaints of tinnitus were associated with amikacin and streptomycin use. These results require confirmation in future studies.	Aminoglycoside; Hearing; Hearing loss; Tuberculosis	HEARING-LOSS; AMINOGLYCOSIDE; OTOTOXICITY; PREVENTION; GENTAMICIN; AMIKACIN
10.1016_j.jiph.2016.11.005	Molecular modelling and docking analysis of katG and rpoB gene in MDR-TB isolates from North Central Indian population	Tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, requires multi drug therapy approach. Drug resistance in M. tuberculosis is caused by mutations in specific regions in drug target genes. The study aimed to identify mutations in katG and rpoB genes and investigate the drug-drug target interactions. A total of 27 MDR-TB isolates were sequenced for katG and rpoB genes and docking and MIC analysis were performed. Three types of mutations for katG gene (Arg463Leu in all isolates of Sahariya and non-tribes; Asp529Thr and Asp529His, each in two isolates only, in Sahariya) were observed. In rpoB gene, the Ser531Leu change was observed in 17/21 isolates in Sahariya and 3/6 isolates in non-tribes. The docking analysis revealed that the drugs isoniazid and rifampicin bind to different residues in mutant forms than their proposed active sites, making active binding sites rigid and causing resistance. The MIC for isoniazid was found to range from 0.2 to 5 mu g/ml in Sahariya tribe, whereas, in non-tribes, it is 0.2 mu g/ml and 1 mu g/ml. The MIC for rifampicin was observed at 64 mu g/ml in both the population groups. The study explored the possible functional variation in isoniazid and rifampicin resistance with respect to the identified mutations. The present results indicate that these mutations affect the drug binding affinity and are causing resistance. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Limited.

10.1016_j.jiph.2017.04.008	Screening mutations in drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in Yunnan, China	Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB), especially multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), is a seriousmedical and societal problem in China. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the mutation characteristics of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) isolates in Yunnan, China. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed in 523 clinical M. tuberculosis isolates. Six drug resistancegenes (katG, inhA, rpoB, rpsL, embB, and pncA) were selected to screen for mutations. In total, 54 clinical M. tuberculosis strains were identified as drug-resistant by DST, including 18 single drug-resistant( SDR) strains and 36 multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. Twenty-four types of mutations in five genes( excluding the inhA gene) were screened in forty-one strains. Six novel mutations were identified in thisstudy, including three missense mutations (p. S302R in katG, p. D78G in embB, and p. M1I in pncA), twoframeshift mutations (408 ins A and 538-580 del in pncA), and one mutation in a control region (-6 C>T located upstream of rpsL). The mutation frequencies in the hotspot mutation regions in the katG, rpoB, rpsL, embB, and pncA genes were 92.5%, 44.4%, 54.2%, 52.6%, and 37.5%, respectively. The mutation spectraand frequencies seemed some what unique in the Yunnan DR-TB strains. (C) 2017 The Authors.

10.1016_j.jgar.2017.04.010	High proportion of modern genotypes of M-tuberculosis and their affinity with drug resistance in northern region of India	Objectives: Comparative genomics on the basis of TbD1 deletion has differentiated the members of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) in two major genogroups. They exhibit differential distribution and virulence potential. The present study was carried out to see the proportion of these genogroups and their association with drug resistance. Methods: The drug resistance pattern of 205 culture positive cases of M. tuberculosis and their relation with TbD1 deletion was analysed from the tertiary care centre. Overall proportion of genotypes (TbD1 - and Tbd1+) and their association with drug resistance was also observed from the various studies from India. Results: Our study reports that 85.4% of the isolates of M. tuberculosis were modern genotypes (TbD1 -) and rest of 14.6% were ancient genotypes (TbD1+). 37 cases were of multiple drug resistant-TB (MDR-TB), 35 of them belongs to modern genogrop and rest of (2) were in ancient genogroup (p = 0.12). Overall pooled estimate of proportion of modern genotype is 75.5% (CI 95%, 73.03-77.87) and 24.55% (CI 95%, 22.13-26.97) for ancient genotypes from the studies carried out in India. Modern genotypes were more rarely drug sensitive phenotypes with a relative risk (RR) of 0.89 (CI 95%, 0.74-1.07) while MDR cases were more in this group with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.27 (CI 95%, 0-1.07). Conclusions: This study demonstrates a higher proportion of modern genotypes in our region/India; which are more likely to be associated with drug resistance. Future, epidemiological/in vitro studies are required to ascertain the relationship between genotypes and their virulence potential.

10.1016_j.jgar.2017.06.007	Sesamol exhibits potent antimycobacterial activity: Underlying mechanisms and impact on virulence traits	Objectives: Novel strategies to overcome multidrug resistance (MDR) in Tuberculosis (TB) still remain a concern. Usage of natural compounds nowadays to surmount the increasing burden of MDR-TB has shown promising results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimycobacterial potential of sesamol (Ses) a natural phenolic compound against Mycobacterium smegmatis, a surrogate for MTB and its underlying mechanism of action along with its effect on mycobacterial virulence traits. Methods: Cell surface phenotypes were estimated microscopically and spectrophotometrically respectively. Membrane parameters were assessed using propidium iodide (PI) uptake, passive diffusion of drug with substrate EtBr and phenotypic susceptibility assay. Changes in lipid profiles were estimated by lipase assay. Oxidative and genotoxic damage were studied using fluorescent probes DCFDA and DAPI. Biofilm formation was studied using crystal violet and calcoflour white staining probes along with biomass measurement. Cell adherence was estimated using buccal epithelial cells. Results: We observed that antimycobacterial activity of Ses was 6 mM and it enhances the efficiency of known anti-TB drugs. Ses affects cell surface phenotypes as displayed by altered colony morphology, impaired sliding motility and enhanced cell sedimentation rate. Membrane perturbation was revealed by hypersensitivity against SDS, reduced PI uptake, enhanced passive diffusion and lipase activity. In addition, Ses leads to oxidative and DNA damage along with abrogated iron homeostasis. Furthermore, we uncover phenotypes related to virulence like inhibited biofilm formation and cell adherence to buccal epithelial cells. Conclusion: This study for the first time establishes the anti-mycobacterial potential of Ses that may be further exploited for improving the therapeutic strategies and warrants further attention.

10.1016_j.micpath.2017.07.005	Molecular detection of Isoniazid, Rifampin and Ethambutol resistance to M-tuberculosis and M-bovis in multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients in Pakistan	The various aspects of MDR-TB, type of pathogen, different drug sensitive methods and mutation (s) in specific genes were determined. The histone-like protein (hupB) gene of M. tuberculosis was targeted by using primer sets: N & S and M & S (produced 645 bp & 318 bp fragment respectively). The most significant risk factors were the poverty and male gender of ages 11-25 years. All samples were detected as M. tuberculosis. By Drug Proportion method, the highest percentage (37%) was found resistant to only Rifampin. By MGIT method, the highest percentage (82.2%) was found resistant with the triple combination (Rifampin-RIF + Isoniazid-INH + Ethambutol-EMB) of the drugs. The highest mutations (76.92%) were found in gene rpoB (codon 531) in MDR TB patients. By, MAS-PCR, the highest percentage (34%) were found resistant to combination (INH + RIF) of the drugs. Minimum samples were resistant to RIF and RIF + INH drugs by MGIT, while proportionate results were observed from MAS-PCR and DP. Moreover, by MAS-PCR mutation in gene embB (306) caused EMB resistance (51.64%). We found that M. tuberculosis was the main cause of MDR-TB. Our findings may further be used for an early diagnosis of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.5588_ijtld.17.0086	Trends in drug-resistant tuberculosis in China: data from a clinical tuberculosis centre	OBJECTIVE: To describe the trends in prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) among in-patients in Beijing Chest Hospital, Beijing, China, using a 10-year retrospective study. DESIGN: From 2005 to 2014, 18 310 in-patients with TB were recruited for the study, most of whom were referrals; no distinction was made between new and previously treated cases. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed in culture-positive cases using the proportion method to determine multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). Risk factors associated with drug resistance were identified. RESULTS: A total of 5141 (28.0%) samples were culture-positive. DST results showed that 860 (16.7%) cases were MDR-TB and 176 (3.4%) were XDR-TB. MDR-TB and XDR-TB were detected in respectively 21.2% and 12.5% of new cases. The rate of MDR-TB and XDR-TB gradually increased from 2005, with MDR-TB reaching a peak in 2008 and XDR-TB in 2009. These data closely mirror national survey data on this region, patient age and occupation. CONCLUSION: Trends in MDR-TB and XDR-TB prevalence during the past decade and their inflection points were determined, which complemented reports from previous national surveys. This information is useful for fighting TB in China.	tuberculosis; prevalent tendency; multi drug resistance; extensive drug resistance	PUBLIC-HEALTH SYSTEM; EXTRAPULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; NATIONAL-SURVEY; PULMONARY
10.5588_ijtld.17.0174	Clinical significance of QT-prolonging drug use in patients with MDR-TB or NTM disease	SETTING: Many drugs with potential QT prolongation effects (QT drugs) have already been used for decades in patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) or non tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) disease, but without a common consensus. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of QT drugs on cardiac events in patients with MDR-TB or NTM disease. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 373 patients (mean age: 56.4 years) with MDR-TB or NTM disease treated for > 1 month with clofazimine (CFZ), moxifloxacin (MFX), bedaquiline (BDQ), delamanid (DLM) or macrolides (clarithromycin or azithromycin). Adverse cardiac events, death and QTcF changes were evaluated. RESULTS: Forty-four per cent had MDR-TB; 165 (44%), 315 (85%), 10 (3%), 229 (61%) and 1 patientreceived CFZ, MFX, BDQ, macrolides and DLM, respectively. Except for three patients (0.8%) lost to follow-up with unknown cause of death, 3 (0.8%, 95%CI 0.2-2.4) adverse cardiac events were documented: atrial fibrillation, cardiac tamponade due to TB pericarditis and cardiac arrest, which was determined to not have been caused by QT drugs. Clinically significant QTcF changes (QTcF > 500 msec or an increase > 60 msec) were observed in 10/60 patients (17%, 95%CI 8.0-30.7) without clinical events. CONCLUSION: The use of QT drugs, alone or in combination, in the treatment of MDR-1B or NTM disease is relatively safe.

OBJECTIVE: To present operational data and discuss the challenges of implementing FAST (Find cases Actively, Separate safely and Treat effectively) as a tuberculosis (TB) transmission control strategy. DESIGN: FAST was implemented sequentially at three hospitals. RESULTS: Using Xpert MTB/RIF, 733/6028 (12.2%, 95 %CI 11.4-13.0) patients were diagnosed with unsuspected TB. Patients with a history of TB who were admitted with other lung diseases had more than twice the odds of being diagnosed with unsuspected TB as those with no history of TB (OR 2.6, 95%CI 2.2-3.0, P < 0.001). Unsuspected multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) was diagnosed in 89/1415 patients (6.3%, 95%CI 5.1-7.7). Patients with unsuspected TB had nearly five times the odds of being diagnosed with MDR-TB than those admitted with a known TB diagnosis (OR 4.9, 95 %CI 3.1-7.6, P < 0.001). Implementation challenges include staff shortages, diagnostic failure, supply-chain issues and reliance on external funding. CONCLUSION: FAST implementation revealed a high frequency of unsuspected TB in hospitalized patients in Bangladesh. Patients with a previous history of TB have an increased risk of being diagnosed with unsuspected TB. Ensuring financial resources, stakeholder engagement and laboratory capacity are important for sustain ability and scalability.

10.1128_AAC.00511_17	Pyrazinamide Susceptibility and pncA Mutation Profiles of Mycobacterium tuberculosis among Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients in Bangladesh	Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a frontline antituberculosis (anti-TB) drug used in both first-and second-line treatment regimens. However, due to complex laboratory requirements, the PZA susceptibility test is rarely performed, leading to a scarcity of data on susceptibility to PZA. Bangladesh is a country with a burden of high rates of both TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), but to our knowledge, published data on rates of PZA susceptibility (PZA(s)), especially among MDR-TB patients, are limited. We aimed to analyze the PZA susceptibility patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from MDR-TB patients and to correlate the pncA mutation with PZA resistance in Bangladesh. A total of 169 confirmed MDR M. tuberculosis isolates from a pool of specimens collected in a nationwide surveillance study were included in this analysis. All the isolates were tested for phenotypic PZA susceptibility in Bactec mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT) culture medium, and the pncA gene was sequenced. We also correlated different types of clinical information and treatment outcomes with PZA susceptibility. We found that 45% of isolates were phenotypically PZA resistant. Sequencing of the pncA gene revealed a high concordance (82.2%) between the pncA gene sequence and the phenotypic assay results. A total of 64 different mutations were found, and 9 isolates harbored multiple mutations. We detected 27 new pncA mutations. We did not find any significant correlation between the different clinical categories, the genetic lineage, or treatment outcome group and PZA susceptibility. Considering the turnaround time, sequencing would be the more feasible option to determine PZA susceptibility, and further studies to investigate the MIC of PZA should be conducted to determine an effective dose of the drug.	pyrazinamide; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; MDR-TB; pncA; Bangladesh	EPIDEMIOLOGY; CHEMOTHERAPY; PORTUGAL; MUTANTS; BRAZIL; CHINA
10.1128_AAC.02039_16	Sterilizing Effect of Ertapenem-Clavulanate in a Hollow-Fiber Model of Tuberculosis and Implications on Clinical Dosing	Carbapenems are now being explored for treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), especially in conjunction with clavulanate. Clinical use is constrained by the need for multiple parenteral doses per day and the lack of knowledge of the optimal dose for sterilizing effect. Our objective was to identify the ertapenem exposure associated with optimal sterilizing effect and then design a once-a-day dose for clinical use. We utilized the hollow-fiber system model of tuberculosis in a 28-day exposure-response study of 8 different ertapenem doses in combination with clavulanate. The systems were sampled at predetermined time points to verify the concentration-time profile and identify the total bacterial burden. Inhibitory sigmoid maximum-effect (E-max) modeling was used to identify the relationship between total bacterial burden and the drug exposure and to identify optimal exposures. Contrary to the literature, ertapenem-clavulanate combination demonstrated good microbial kill and sterilizing effect. In a dose fractionation hollow-fiber study, efficacy was linked to percentage of the 24-h dosing interval of ertapenem concentration persisting above MIC (%T-MIC). We performed 10,000 MDR-TB patient computer-aided clinical trial simulations, based on Monte Carlo methods, to identify the doses and schedule that would achieve or exceed a %T-MIC of >= 40%. We identified an intravenous dosage of 2 g once per day as achieving the target in 96% of patients. An ertapenem susceptibility breakpoint MIC of 2 mg/liter was identified for that dose. An ertapenem dosage of 2 g once daily is the most suitable to be tested in a phase II study of sterilizing effect in MDR-TB patients.

10.1016_j.tube.2017.07.002	Real-time PCR followed by high-resolution melting curve analysis: A rapid and pragmatic approach for screening of multidrug-resistant extrapulmonary tuberculosis	Introduction: Multidrug resistance (MDR) in extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) is a diagnostic challenge in an endemic country like India. Timely detection of MDR-TB can contribute to a better patient outcome. Objective: To perform real-time PCR (qPCR) using rpoB, mpb64 and IS6110 gene on a variety of EPTB samples and to compare the performance of different gene targets. All qPCR positive samples were subjected to high resolution melt-curve analysis (HRM analysis) for rpoB and katG gene to evaluate its potential for MDR screening among different sample types. Methods: Real-time PCR using rpoB, mpb64 and IS6110 genes was carried out on 200 cases of study group and 100 cases of non-TB control group. The study group consisted of 100 culture-confirmed and 100 clinically suspected cases of EPTB. Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) for culture isolates was performed by the 1% indirect agar proportion method. DNA extracted from all qPCR positive samples was subjected to rpoB and katG HRM analysis for screening of MDR. Sequencing was used to confirm the results of HRM analysis and the results were also compared with phenotypic DST in all culture positive cases. Results: The sensitivity of qPCR using rpoB, mpb64 and IS6110 was 86.5%, 86.5% and 76.5%, respectively. All isolates from the control group were negative by all the three targets, giving a specificity of 100%. HRM analysis detected MDR in 22/200 (11%) isolates. 3/200 (1.5%) had mono-rifampicin resistance while 8/200 (4%) had mono-isoniazid resistance. HRM analysis identified an additional 4 MDR cases directly from the samples which were negative by culture. On sequencing, mutations were observed at codon 531 (60%); 533 (16%); 516 (12%) and 526 (12%) of the rpoB gene and at codon 315 (100%) of the katG gene. There was 100% concordance in the results of phenotypic DST, HRM analysis and sequencing. Conclusion: The HRM analysis can play a promising role in the reliable and rapid screening of EPTB samples for detection of MDR. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.1016_j.gene.2017.05.031	The novel gene mtb192 is a candidate marker for the detection of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains	Background: Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most main threats to the global TB control work at present. And it's very difficult to detect. From a screen of differentially expressed genes in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains, we identified a new gene, mtb192. In the present study, we verified the association of mtb192 with TB drug resistance by detecting its expression in clinical isolates from paediatric TB patients. Materials and methods: The homology of mtb192 was analysed by gene blasting in GenBank. The drug resistance of clinical TB isolates was tested, and mtb192 gene expression was compared using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative PCR. Results: Gene homology suggested that mtb192 is a new gene sequence. Among the 120 clinical isolates, 14 were positive for mtb192, including 12 in the MDR group, 2 in the single drug-resistant group, 1 in the poly-resistant group, and 1 in the sensitive group. The mtb192 positive expression rate was significantly higher in the MDR group than all other groups, and the mtb192 mRNA expression level was significantly higher in the MDR group than in the non-MDR group. Conclusions: The new gene mtb192 showed significantly higher expression in MDR-TB strains and could be related to the development of MDR in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, highlighting it as a new genetic marker in the detection of MDR-TB.

10.1186_s12879_017_2668_2	The impact of drug resistance on the risk of tuberculosis infection and disease in child household contacts: a cross sectional study	Background: The relative fitness of organisms causing drug-susceptible (DS) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) is unclear. We compared the risk of TB infection and TB disease in young child household contacts of adults with confirmed DS-TB and MDR-TB. Methods: In this cross-sectional analysis we included data from two community-based contact cohort investigation studies conducted in parallel in Cape Town, South Africa. Children <5 years of age with household exposure to an infectious TB case were included between August 2008 to June 2011. Children completed investigation for TB infection (tuberculin skin test) and TB disease (symptom evaluation, chest radiograph, bacteriology) in both studies using standard approaches. The impact of MDR-TB exposure on each covariate of TB infection and TB disease was assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Results: Of 538 children included, 312 had DS-TB and 226 had MDR-TB exposure. 107 children with DS-TB exposure had TB infection (34.3%) vs. 101 (44.7%) of children with MDR-TB exposure (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR]: 2.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.34-3.12). A total of 15 (6.6%) MDR-TB vs. 27 (8.7%) DS-TB child contacts had TB disease at enrolment (aOR: 0. 43; 95% CI: 0.19-0.97). Conclusions: Our results suggest a higher risk of TB infection in child contacts with household MDR-TB vs. DS-TB exposure, but a lower risk of TB disease. Although potentially affected by residual confounding or selection bias, our results are consistent with the hypothesis of impaired virulence in MDR-TB strains in this setting.

10.1186_s12879_017_2662_8	Treatment outcomes of patients with multidrug-resistant and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis in Hunan Province, China	Background: The worldwide emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has posed additional challenges for global tuberculosis (TB) control efforts, as limited treatment options are available and treatment outcomes are often sub-optimal. This study determined treatment outcomes among a cohort of MDR-TB and XDR-TB patients in Hunan Province, China, and identified factors associated with poor treatment outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study using data obtained from medical records of TB patients in Hunan Chest Hospital, and from the internet-based TB management information system managed by the Tuberculosis Control Institute of Hunan Province, for the period 2011 to 2014. Treatment outcomes were assessed for patients diagnosed with MDR-TB (TB resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin) and XDR-TB (MDR-TB plus resistance to any fluoroquinolone and at least 1 second-line injectable drug). Cumulative incidence functions were used to estimate time to events (i.e. poor treatment outcomes, loss to follow-up, and unfavourable treatment outcomes); and a competing-risks survival regression model was used to identify predictors of treatment outcomes. Result: Of 481 bacteriologically-confirmed patients, with a mean age of 40 years (standard deviation SD +/- 13 years), 10 (2%) had XDR-TB and the remainder (471; 98%) had MDR-TB. For the entire cohort, treatment success was 57% (n = 275); 58% (n = 272) for MDR-TB and 30% (n = 3) for XDR-TB. Overall, 27% were lost to follow-up (n = 130), 27% (n = 126) for MDR-TB and 40% (n = 4) for XDR-TB; and 16% had a poor treatment outcome (n = 76), 15% for MDR-TB and 30% (n = 3) for XDR-TB. Of the 10 XDR-TB patients, 3 (30%) completed treatment, 3 (30%) died and 4 (40%) were lost to follow-up. Of the 471 MDR-TB patients, 258 (57%) were cured, 16 (3%) completed treatment, 13 (3%) died, 60 (13%) experienced treatment failure, and 126 (27%) were lost to follow-up. Resistance to ofloxacin was an independent predictor of poor (AHR = 3.1; 95% CI = 1.5, 6.3), and unfavourable (AHR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.07, 2.9) treatment outcomes. Patients who started treatment during 2011-2012 (AHR = 2.8; 95% CI = 1.5, 5.3) and 2013 (AHR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.2, 3.9) had poorer treatment outcomes compared to patients who started treatment during 2014. Conclusion: Patients with MDR-TB and XDR-TB had low rates of treatment success in Hunan Province, especially among patients who started treatment during 2011 to 2013, with evidence of improved treatment outcomes in 2014. Resistance to ofloxacin was an independent predictor of poor treatment outcomes.

10.1016_j.bmcl.2017.07.023	Design, synthesis and in vitro anti-mycobacterial evaluation of gatifloxacin-1H-1,2,3-triazole-isatin hybrids	A set of novel gatifloxacin-1H-1,2,3-triazole-isatin hybrids 6a-1 was designed, synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro anti-mycobacterial activities against M. tuberculosis (MTB) H(37)Rv and MDR-TB as well as cytotoxicity. The results showed that all the targets (MIC: 0.025-3.12 mu g/mL) exhibited excellent inhibitory activity against MTB H37Rv and MDR-TB, but were much more toxic (CC50: 7.8-62.5 mu g/mL) than the parent gatifloxacin (GTFX) (CC50: 125 mu g/mL). Among them, 61 (MIC: 0.025 mu g/mL) was 2-32 times more potent in vitro than the references INH (MIC: 0.05 mu g/mL), GTFX (MIC: 0.78 mu g/mL) and RIF (MIC: 0.39 mu g/mL) against MTB H(37)Rv. The most active conjugate 6 k (MIC: 0.06 mu g/mL) was 16 -> 2048 times more potent than the three references (MIC: 1.0 -> 128 mu/mL) against MDR-TB. Both of the two hybrids warrant further investigations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.1038_s41598_017_07959_2	Epidemiology of tuberculosis in Chongqing, China: a secular trend from 1992 to 2015	Chongqing is a southwest city of China with high tuberculosis (TB) burden. An observational retrospective study has been performed based on routine TB surveillance data in Chongqing from 1992 to 2015. The TB notification rate has declined to 70.8 cases per 100,000 population from the peak of 106 cases per 100,000 in 2005. The TB notification rate in population over-65 years has become the highest among all-ages population since 2010. The average proportion of farmers in all notified cases from 2008 to 2015 was 62.5%, and the notification rate of farmers has become the highest among all occupations since 2011. The TB notification showed a regional disparity in Chongqing. Despite the improvement achieved since 1992, the TB control efforts has been threatened by new challenges such as the demographic shift towards an aging population, the prevalence of MDR-TB and TB/HIV co-infection, and the regional disparity of TB notification. More effective interventions should be implemented. Our study can serve as a guidance for the future development of TB control in Chongqing, and we believe it has general relevance to TB control in other regions with similar situations.

10.1186_s12879_017_2652_x	Epidemiological trends and outcomes of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in Shandong, China	Background: Extensively Drug-Resistant (XDR) Tuberculosis (TB) has posed a great threat to global health and finance systems, especially for developing countries with high TB and Multidrug-Resistant (MDR) TB burden. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed HIV-uninfected TB case confirmed and treated in Shandong Provincial Chest Hospital (SPCH) between January 2008 and December 2015. Unique characteristics of XDR-TB were identified; its longitudinal changes and survival were analyzed. Results: Between January 2008 and December 2015, a total of 144 cases were confirmed to be XDR-TB (2.5% of 5663 culture-confirmed TB cases; 27.9% of 516 MDR-TB cases). The proportion of XDR TB cases among MDR-TB cases has increased from 26.5% in 2008 to 44.5% in 2014 (Chi-Square test for trends: P < 0.01). Among the 144 XDR-TB cases, 21 patients (14.6%) had treatment success, 123 (85.1%) had poor treatment outcomes. Mortality was higher among XDR-TB cases than among MDR TB cases (8.3% vs. 3.8%, P = 0.033) and drug-susceptible TB cases (8. 3% vs. 2.1%, P < 0.01). Conclusions: XDR-TB cases comprise a substantial and increasing fraction of MDR-TB cases, causing poor treatment outcomes and high mortalities. Early drug susceptibility testing, adequate TB treatment and efficient infection control must be in place in future TB control strategies.

10.1371_journal.pone.0182780	Evaluation of a nurse practitioner-physician task-sharing model for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa	Background Treatment success rates for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in South Africa remain close to 50%. Lack of access to timely, decentralized care is a contributing factor. We evaluated MDR-TB treatment outcomes from a clinical cohort with task-sharing between a clinical nurse practitioner (CNP) and a medical officer (MO). Methods We completed a retrospective evaluation of outcomes from a prospective, programmatically-based MDR-TB cohort who were enrolled and received care between 2012 and 2015 at a peri-urban hospital in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Treatment was provided by either by a CNP or MO. Findings The cohort included 197 participants with a median age of 33 years, 51% female, and 74% co-infected with HIV. The CNP initiated 123 participants on treatment. Overall MDR-TB treatment success rate in this cohort was 57.9%, significantly higher than the South African national average of 45% in 2012 (p<0.0001) and similar to the provincal average of 60% (p = NS). There were no significant differences by provider type: treatment success was 61% for patients initiated by the CNP and 52.7% for those initiated by the MO. Interpretation Clinics that adopted a task sharing approach for MDR-TB demonstrated greater treatment success rates than the national average. Task-sharing between the CNP and MO did not adversely impact treatment outcome with similar success rates noted. Task-sharing is a feasible option for South Africa to support decentralization without compromising patient outcomes. Models that allow sharing of responsibility for MDR-TB may optimize the use of human resources and improve access to care.		ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; MDR-TB; OUTCOMES; DOCTORS
10.1128_AAC.00490_17	Pharmacokinetics of Pyrazinamide and Optimal Dosing Regimens for Drug-Sensitive and -Resistant Tuberculosis	Pyrazinamide is used in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) because its sterilizing effect against tubercle bacilli allows the shortening of treatment. It is part of standard treatment for drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB, and it is being considered as a companion drug in novel regimens. The aim of this analysis was to characterize factors contributing to the variability in exposure and to evaluate drug exposures using alternative doses, thus providing evidence to support revised dosing recommendations for drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Pyrazinamide pharmacokinetic (PK) data from 61 HIV/TB-coinfected patients in South Africa were used in the analysis. The patients were administered weight-adjusted doses of pyrazinamide, rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol in fixed-dose combination tablets according to WHO guidelines and underwent intensive PK sampling on days 1, 8, 15, and 29. The data were interpreted using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. PK profiles were best described using a one-compartment model with first-order elimination. Allometric scaling was applied to disposition parameters using fat-free mass. Clearance increased by 14% from the 1st day to the 29th day of treatment. More than 50% of patients with weight less than 55 kg achieved lower pyrazinamide exposures at steady state than the targeted area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h of 363 mg.h/liter. Among patients with drug-susceptible TB, adding 400 mg to the dose for those weighing 30 to 54 kg improved exposure. Average pyrazinamide exposure in different weight bands among patients with MDR-TB could be matched by administering 1,500 mg, 1,750 mg, and 2,000 mg to patients in the 33-to 50-kg, 51-to 70-kg, and greater than 70-kg weight bands, respectively.

10.3855_jidc.8009	A suggested algorithm for detection of multi drug-resistant tuberculosis in Zimbabwe	Introduction: Rapid genotypic and phenotypic methods for multi-drug-resistant-tuberculosis (MDR-TB) detection are now widely available. Zimbabwe adopted the use of GeneXpert-MTB/RIF, microscopic-observation-drug-susceptibility-assay (MODS) and Mycobacteria-Growth-Indicator-Tube (MGIT) drug-susceptibility-testing (DST). Data is limited on the ideal combination of use of these methods in resource limited settings. Methodology: Between August 2014 to July 2015, 211 sputa from MDR-TB suspects were tested with GeneXpert-MTB/RIF, MODS, manual-MGIT and Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ)-DST to determine diagnostic accuracy and turnaround-time (TAT), with LJ-DST as the gold standard. A performance score ranking table for diagnostic accuracy, TAT, costs, facilities and expertise requirements, was used to determine the most favourable tool. Results: GeneXpert-MTB/RIF sensitivity was 96% (95% CI: 80-100) and specificity was 95% (95% CI: 90-97). MODS sensitivity was 88% (95% CI: 68-97) and specificity was 97% (95% CI: 87-100). Manual MGIT-DST had slightly lower sensitivity of 80% (95% CI: 59-93). Median time to detection of MDR-TB was < 1 day (IQR: 0-0) for Xpert, 14 days (IQR: 11-31) for MODS, 21 days (IQR: 7-22) for MGIT-DST and 28 days (IQR: 25-28) for LJ-DST. Operational costs for MODS, MGIT-DST, and GeneXpert-MTB/RIF were $21.20, $27.52 and $39.76 respectively. From a summation of scores including facility and expertise requirements per diagnostic technique, GeneXpert-MTB/RIF was the most favourable tool, followed by MODS and MGIT-DST. Conclusions: For best scale-up of MDR-TB diagnosis in Zimbabwe, GeneXpert-MTB/RIF can be used for rapid detection of TB in smear negative cases, RIF-susceptibility for early treatment initiation and probable MDR-TB. MODS can rapidly confirm probable MDR-TB detected by GeneXpert-MTB/RIF, manual-MGIT can provide early results for susceptibility to other antibiotics, with affordable costs, with LJ-DST confirming discordant DSTs.

10.5588_ijtld.16.0933	What happened to patients with RMP-resistant/MDR-TB in Zambia reported as lost to follow-up from 2011 to 2014?	SETTING: University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, and Ndola Central Hospital, Ndola, Zambia, which implemented active tracing of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients reported as lost to follow-up (LTFU). OBJECTIVE: To determine 1) the number of patients treated for MDR-TB between 2011 and 2014; 2) the number, proportion, month when LTFU and characteristics of patients registered as LTFU; and 3) final outcomes observed following active patient tracing. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: Of 184 patients treated for confirmed MDR-TB, 76 (41%) were reported as LTFU. From 2011 to 2014, the proportions reported each year as LTFU were respectively 21%, 47%, 51% and 39%. Of patients who were LTFU, 43 (57%) had stopped attending the clinic during the intensive phase. These patients were predominantly male, aged 15-44 years, had pulmonary disease and had failed previous treatment. Of 57 (75%) patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, 42 (74%) were HIV-positive, 57% of whom were on antiretroviral treatment. After active patient tracing, 29 (38%) patients could not be found and the observed outcome remained LTFU. Of the remaining 47 patients, 29 (62%) were alive and had completed or were still on treatment, 14 (30%) were alive but had stopped treatment and 4 (8%) had died. CONCLUSION: Zambia has been underreporting its favourable outcomes for MDR-TB treatment and should continue with active tracing of LTFU patients.	true outcomes; loss to follow-up; active patient tracing; SORT IT; operational research; Africa	MDR-TB; TUBERCULOSIS; OUTCOMES; MANAGEMENT; REGIMEN; MALAWI
10.5588_ijtld.16.0850	Prevalence of pyrazinamide resistance and Wayne assay performance analysis in a tuberculosis cohort in Lima, Peru	BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) regimens often contain pyrazinamide (PZA) even if susceptibility to the drug has not been confirmed. This gap is due to the limited availability and reliability of PZA susceptibility testing. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of PZA resistance using the Wayne assay among TB patients in Lima, Peru, to describe characteristics associated with PZA resistance and to compare the performance of Wayne with that of BACTEC (TM) MGIT (TM) 960. METHODS: PZA susceptibility using the Wayne assay was tested in patients diagnosed with culture-positive pulmonary TB from September 2009 to August 2012. Factors associated with PZA resistance were evaluated. We compared the performance of the Wayne assay to that of MGIT 960 in a convenience sample. RESULTS: The prevalence of PZA resistance was 6.6% (95%CI 5.8-7.5) among 3277 patients, and 47.7% (95%CI 42.7-52.6) among a subset of 405 MDR-TB patients. In multivariable analysis, MDR-TB (OR 86.0, 95 %CI 54.0-136.9) and Latin American-Mediterranean lineage (OR 3.40, 95%CI 2.33-4.96) were associated with PZA resistance. The Wayne assay was in agreement with MGIT 960 in 83.9% of samples (kappa 0.66, 95%CI 0.56-0.76). CONCLUSION: PZA resistance was detected using the Wayne assay in nearly half of MDR-TB patients in Lima. This test can inform the selection and composition of regimens, especially those dependent on additional resistance.

10.5588_ijtld.16.0717	Modeling the impact of bedaquiline treatment strategies on the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis burden in India	SETTING: Bedaquiline (BDQ) has been approved in India for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), but is currently recommended for MDR-TB patients who have failed initial treatment with standard regimens. While some have argued that such deferred BDQ use allows a second line of defense with a potent drug, this strategy may not be optimal. OBJECTIVE: To compare several distinct scenarios of BDQ access and use, and their potential impact on the MDR-TB disease burden and the associated net economic benefit in India. METHOD: We used a state-transition model to carry out this evaluation. The scenarios differed in the timing and breadth of BDQ access. RESULTS: The simulations showed that a strategy reliant on reserving the use of BDQ for those who have failed other MDR-TB regimens is likely to result in worse treatment outcomes for patients and in inferior public health outcomes for communities, leading to reduced net monetary benefit. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that deferring patient access to new drugs such as BDQ until front-line regimens have failed, in order to 'save' these drugs for later use, could be detrimental to patients and to public health, and could reduce the economic benefit of treating MDR-TB.	economic burden; disease burden; simulation model	
10.1016_j.ijantimicag.2017.01.042	Role of second-line injectable antituberculosis drugs in the treatment of MDR/XDR tuberculosis	Second-line injectable antituberculosis drugs (aminoglycosides and capreomycin) are the main drugs used in the management of resistant tuberculosis. Their preserved efficacy in the case of multi-drug-resistant bacillus is counterbalanced by frequent adverse events. Adverse events are linked to the drugs themselves and to the recommended 8-month period of parenteral administration. In numerous countries facing a high incidence of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, treatment is administered by intramuscular injection. This procedure is painful and restrictive, and therefore treatment adherence is limited. This study reports the follow-up of 11 patients diagnosed with multi-drug-and extensively-resistant tuberculosis and treated with parenteral amikacin, and discusses the role of amikacin in the treatment of resistant tuberculosis.

10.1128_AAC.00343_17	Pharmacokinetics of Levofloxacin in Multidrug-and Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients	Pharmacodynamics are especially important in the treatment of multidrug-and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (M/XDR-TB). The free area under the concentration time curve in relation to MIC (fAUC/MIC) is the most relevant pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) parameter for predicting the efficacy of levofloxacin (LFX). The objective of our study was to assess LFX PK variability in M/XDR-TB patients and its potential consequence for fAUC/MIC ratios. Patients with pulmonary M/XDR-TB received LFX as part of the treatment regimen at a dose of 15 mg/kg administered once daily. Blood samples obtained at steady state before and 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 12 h after drug administration were measured by validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The MIC values of LFX were determined by the agar dilution method on Middlebrook 7H10 and the MGIT960 system. Twenty patients with a mean age of 31 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 27 to 35 years) were enrolled in this study. The median AUC(0-24) was 98.8 mg/h/liter (IQR = 84.8 to 159.6 mg/h/liter). The MIC median value for LFX was 0.5 mg/liter with a range of 0.25 to 2.0 mg/liter, and the median fAUC(0-24)/MIC ratio was 109.5 (IQR = 48.5 to 399.4). In 4 of the 20 patients, the value was below the target value of >= 100. When MICs of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/liter were applicable, 19, 18, 3, and no patients, respectively, had an fAUC/MIC ratio that exceeded 100. We observed a large variability in AUC. An fAUC(0-24)/MIC of >= 100 was only observed when the MIC values for LFX were 0.25 to 0.5 mg/liter. Dosages exceeding 15 mg/kg should be considered for target attainment if exposures are assumed to be safe.	levofloxacin; MDR-TB; pharmacodynamics; pharmacokinetics; pharmacology; treatment; tuberculosis; XDR-TB	HOLLOW-FIBER MODEL; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; POPULATION PHARMACOKINETICS; IN-VITRO; FLUOROQUINOLONES; PHARMACODYNAMICS; MOXIFLOXACIN; REGIMENS; SUSCEPTIBILITY
10.1016_j.mimet.2017.06.007	Evaluation of the BACTEC MGIT 960 system and the resazurin microtiter assay for susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to second-line drugs	Drug resistance in tuberculosis is a major threat to public health and control of the disease worldwide. Given the need of a rapid and accurate detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to second-line drugs, this study evaluated the performance of the BACTEC MGIT 960 for second-line, drug susceptibility testing in comparison with the resazurin microtiter assay (REMA), in order to implement the automated methodology in the diagnostic routine of a reference laboratory. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) for second-line drugs of 151 MDR M. tuberculosis clinical isolates was performed by both BACTEC MGIT 960 and REMA, and a panel of 26 M. tuberculosis reference isolates from a proficiency test was tested by the BACTEC MGIT 960. DST for second-line drugs by the BACTEC MGIT 960 system was more rapid, highly reproducible and showed 100% of proficiency. After these results, this methodology was successfully implemented in our diagnostic routine for all MDR-TB patients.

10.1186_s12879_017_2594_3	Pyrazinamide resistance-conferring mutations in pncA and the transmission of multidrug resistant TB in Georgia	Background: The ongoing epidemic of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Georgia highlights the need for more effective control strategies. A new regimen to treat MDR-TB that includes pyrazinamide (PZA) is currently being evaluated and PZA resistance status will largely influence the success of current and future treatment strategies. PZA susceptibility testing was not routinely performed at the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) in Tbilisi between 2010 and September 2015. We here provide a first insight into the prevalence of PZA resistant TB in this region. Methods: Phenotypic susceptibility to PZA was determined in a convenience collection of well-characterised TB patient isolates collected at the NRL in Tbilisi between 2012 and 2013. In addition, the pncA gene was sequenced and whole genome sequencing was performed on two isolates. Results: Out of 57 isolates tested 33 (57.9%) showed phenotypic drug resistance to PZA and had a single pncA mutation. All of these 33 isolates were MDR-TB strains. pncA mutations were absent in all but one of the 24 PZA susceptible isolate. In total we found 18 polymorphisms in the pncA gene. From the two major MDR-TB clusters represented (94-32 and 100-32), 10 of 15, 67.0% and 13 of 14, 93.0% strains, respectively were PZA resistant. We also identified a member of the potentially highly transmissive clade A strain carrying the characteristic I6L substitution in PncA. Another strain with the same MLVA type as the clade A strain acquired a different mutation in pncA and was genetically more distantly related suggesting that different branches of this particular lineage have been introduced into this region. Conclusion: In this high MDR-TB setting more than half of the tested MDR-TB isolates were resistant to PZA. As PZA is part of current and planned MDR-TB treatment regimens this is alarming and deserves the attention of health authorities. Based on our typing and sequence analysis results we conclude that PZA resistance is the result of primary transmission as well as acquisition within the patient and recommend prospective genotyping and PZA resistance testing in high MDR-TB settings. This is of utmost importance in order to preserve bacterial susceptibility to PZA to help protect (new) second line drugs in PZA containing regimens.

10.1371_journal.pone.0180916	Polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor gene are associated with reduced rate of sputum culture conversion in multidrugresistant tuberculosis patients in South Africa	Background Vitamin D modulates the inflammatory and immune response to tuberculosis (TB) and also mediates the induction of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin. Deficiency of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene may increase the risk of TB disease and decrease culture conversion rates in drug susceptible TB. Whether these VDR SNPs are found in African populations or impact multidrugresistant (MDR) TB treatment has not been established. We aimed to determine if SNPs in the VDR gene were associated with sputum culture conversion among a cohort of MDR TB patients in South Africa. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of adult MDR TB patients receiving second-line TB treatment in KwaZulu-Natal province. Subjects had monthly sputum cultures performed. In a subset of participants, whole blood samples were obtained for genomic analyses. Genomic DNA was extracted and genotyped with Affymetrix Axiom Pan-African Array. Cox proportional models were used to determine the association between VDR SNPs and rate of culture conversion. Results Genomic analyses were performed on 91 MDR TB subjects enrolled in the sub-study; 60% were female and median age was 35 years (interquartile range [IQR] 29-42). Smoking was reported by 21% of subjects and most subjects had HIV (80%), were smear negative (57%), and had cavitary disease (55%). Overall, 87 (96%) subjects initially converted cultures to negative, with median time to culture conversion of 57 days (IQR 17-114). Of 121 VDR SNPs examined, 10 were significantly associated (p<0.01) with rate of sputum conversion in multivariable analyses. Each additional risk allele on SNP rs74085240 delayed culture conversion significantly (adjusted hazard ratio 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.14-0.67). Conclusions Polymorphisms in the VDR gene were associated with rate of sputum culture conversion in MDR TB patients in this high HIV prevalence setting in South Africa.

10.1186_s13063_017_1996_2	Bracelet- and self-directed observational therapy for control of tuberculosis: study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial	Background: Approximately 80% of global tuberculosis (TB) cases occur in low-resource settings, with little opportunity for TB control. We hypothesized that the rapid increase in smartphone users and advances in digital technology would render bracelet-based applications possible; specifically, that bracelet- and self-directed observational therapy (BSDOT) can be used by patients with TB to ensure adherence to TB medication regimens and by basic village physicians to monitor care. This will ultimately allow TB to be controlled in low-resource environments. Methods and design: This study will have three phases: development of a bracelet capable of storing pills and recording adherence to medication regimens; creation of a BSDOT smartphone application capable of supporting reminders to patients and health care interactions between patients and village physicians; and performance of a cluster randomized controlled trial in Hunan Province, China. Patients in the intervention group will receive free bracelets and smartphones, and their daily medication intake will be directed by the smartphones; the control group will receive no intervention. The primary outcome will be the TB treatment result as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as follows: Cured, Treatment completed, Treatment failed, Died, Lost to follow-up, Not evaluated, or Treatment success. The secondary outcome will be treatment adherence, defined as the percentage of patients receiving TB treatment who missed fewer than 5% of doses. We will also assess self-reported adherence using the Morisky, Green, and Levine Adherence Scale (MGLS) and evaluate respondents' knowledge about TB and quality of life. A regression model will be used to explore whether the interventions improve drug adherence and other outcome measures. Discussion: This will be a powerful means by which to strengthen TB control and prevent TB, especially multidrug-resistant epidemics of the disease. In addition, our novel smartphone-based tool can be readily adopted for use in low-resource remote environments with limited health care facilities and few economic assets. Ethics and dissemination: The protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University (reference number: XYGW-2016-14).

10.4103_0366_6999.208248	Diagnostic Performance of the GenoType MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl Assays to Identify Tuberculosis Drug Resistance in Eastern China	Background: The WHO recently has recommended the GenoType MTBDRplus version 1.0 and MTBDRsl version 1.0 assays for widespread use in countries endemic with drug-resistant tuberculosis. Despite this, these assays have rarely been evaluated in China, where the burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis is among the highest globally. Methods: Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates were obtained between January 2008 and December 2008. Isolates were tested for drug resistance against rifampicin (RFP) and isoniazid (INH) using the GenoType MTBDRplus assay and drug resistance against ethambutol (EMB), ofloxacin (OFX), and kanamycin (KM) using the Genotype MTBDRsl assay. These results were compared with conventional drug-susceptibility testing (DST). Results: Readable results were obtained from 235 strains by GenoType MTBDRplus assay. Compared to DST, the sensitivity of GenoType MTBDRplus assay to detect RFP, INH, and multidrug resistance was 97.7%, 69.9%, and 69.8%, respectively, whereas the specificity for detecting RFP, INH, and multidrug resistance was 66.7%, 69.2%, and 76.8%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the GenoType MTBDRsl assay were 90.9% and 95.2% for OFX, 77.8% and 99.5% for KM, 63.7% and 86.4% for EMB, respectively. Mutations in codon S53 1L of the rpoB gene and codon S315T 1 of KatG gene were dominated in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains. Conclusions: In combination with DST, application of the GenoType MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl assays may be a useful supplementary tool to allow a rapid and safe diagnosis of multidrug resistance and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis.

10.1016_j.tube.2017.04.002	Molecular investigation of active binding site of isoniazid (INH) and insight into resistance mechanism of S315T-MtKatG in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Multi drug resistant tuberculosis is a major threat for mankind. Resistance against Isoniazid (INH), targeting MtKatG protein, is one of the most commonly occurring resistances in MDR TB strains. S315T-MtKatG mutation is widely reported for INH resistance. Despite having knowledge about the mechanism of INH, exact binding site of INH to MtKatG is still uncertain and proposed to have three presumable binding sites (site-1, site-2, and site-3). In the current study docking, molecular dynamics simulation, binding free energy estimation, principal component analysis and free energy landscape analysis were performed to get molecular level details of INH binding site on MtKatG, and to probe the effect of S315T mutation on INH binding. Molecular docking and MD analysis suggested site-1 as active binding site of INH, where the effects of S315T mutation were observed on both access tunnel as well as molecular interaction between INH and its neighboring residues. MMPBSA also supported site-1 as potential binding site with lowest binding energy of -44.201 kJ/mol. Moreover, PCA and FEL revealed that S315T mutation not only reduces the dimension of heme access tunnel but also showed that extra methyl group at 315 position altered heme cavity, enforcing heme group distantly from INH, and thus preventing INH activation. The present study not only investigated the active binding site of INH but also provides a new insight about the conformational changes in the binding site of S315T-MtKatG. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

10.1177_0192623317723085	Dose- and Time-dependency of the Toxicity and Pharmacokinetic Profiles of Bedaquiline and Its N-desmethyl Metabolite in Dogs	Bedaquiline (BDQ) is an antibiotic to treat pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Studies up to 39 weeks were conducted orally in dogs to assess the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of BDQ and its N-desmethyl metabolite (D-BDQ). Phospholipidosis (PLD) seen in the monocytic phagocytic system was considered an adaptive change. Skeletal muscle, heart, stomach, liver, and pancreas toxicities with D-BDQ as the main contributor were associated with a less-than-dose-proportional increase in plasma exposure and an overproportional tissue uptake of BDQ and D-BDQ at high-dose levels. Tissue concentrations of BDQ and D-BDQ slowly decreased after lowering the dose, contributing to the recovery of the pathological findings. Treatment was better tolerated at mid-dose levels, characterized by a dose-proportional increase in plasma and tissue exposures. Treatment at a low dose, reaching exposures approximating therapeutic exposures, was without adverse effects and not associated with PLD. There was no evidence of delayed toxicities after treatment cessation. Intermittent dosing was better tolerated at high doses. Since MDR-TB patients are dosed within the linear plasma exposure range and plasma levels of BDQ and D-BDQ are similar or lower than in dogs, PLD and adverse findings related to tissue accumulation that occurred at high doses in dogs are unlikely to occur in humans.	bedaquiline (BDQ); N-desmethyl metabolite (D-BDQ); phospholipidosis (PLD); plasma exposure; tissue distribution; dog	ATP SYNTHASE; TUBERCULOSIS; PHOSPHOLIPIDOSIS; TMC207
10.1183_13993003.00061_2017	Effectiveness and safety of standardised shorter regimens for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: individual patient data and aggregate data meta-analyses	We assessed the effectiveness and safety of standardised, shorter multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) regimens by pooling data from observational studies. Published studies were identified from medical databases; unpublished studies were identified from expert consultation. We conducted aggregate data meta-analyses to estimate pooled proportions of treatment outcomes and individual patient data (IPD) meta-regression to identify risk factors for unsuccessful treatment in patients treated with 9- to 12-month MDR-TB regimens composed of a second-line injectable, gatifloxacin/moxifloxacin, prothionamide, clofazimine, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. We included five studies in which 796 out of 1279 (62.2%) individuals with confirmed MDR-TB (98.4%) or rifampin-resistant TB (1.6%), and not previously exposed to second-line drugs, were eligible for shorter regimens. 669 out of 796 participants were successfully treated (83.0%, 95% CI 71.9-90.3%). In IPD meta-regression (three studies, n=497), failure/relapse was associated with fluoroquinolone resistance (crude OR 46, 95% CI 8-273), pyrazinamide resistance (OR 8, 95% CI 2-38) and no culture conversion by month 2 of treatment (OR 7, 95% CI 3-202). Two participants acquired extensive drug resistance. Four studies reported grade 3 or 4 adverse events in 55 out of 304 (18.1%) participants. Shorter regimens were effective in treating MDR-TB; however, there is uncertainty surrounding the generalisability of the high rate of treatment success to less selected populations, to programmatic settings and in the absence of drug susceptibility tests to key component drugs.

10.5588_ijtld.16.0658	Migration histories of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients from the Thailand-Myanmar border, 2012-2014	SETTING: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a growing public health threat in South-East Asia. TB is typically a disease of poverty and can be spread by infectious humans who migrate from one region to another. DESIGN: We interviewed 20 MDR-TB patients on the Thailand-Myanmar border with regard to their migration histories. Migration origins and destinations were mapped. RESULTS: All but one participant had a history of migration, and maps of migration ranges revealed wide geographic dispersal. Most described living and work conditions that could contribute to the spread of drug resistant TB, including numerous contacts and crowded living quarters. CONCLUSION: Our results show that at least some migrant workers in the region carry MDR-TB, and indicate that this subgroup of the population is important with regard to the transmission of MDR-TB throughout the region. Migrants in this region come into contact with high numbers of people and may be able to spread the disease across wide geographic ranges. Access to diagnosis and treatment and socio-economic development are at least as important as any TB control measures, meaning that innovative and bold approaches that extend across international borders are needed to address these problems.	poverty; South-East Asia; disease ecology; diagnosis; treatment	
10.5588_ijtld.16.0759	Trends in drug-resistant tuberculosis after the implementation of the DOTS strategy in Shenzhen, China, 2000-2013	SETTING: The DOTS strategy has been regarded as the most cost-effective way to stop the spread of tuberculosis (TB) since its launch by the World Health Organization. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effects of DOTS by tracking long-term trends in multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was conducted from 2000 to 2013 to analyse trends in resistance to antituberculosis drugs and the effect of DOTS-based treatment in Shenzhen, China, using the x2 test. RESULTS: An overall MDR-TB rate of 4.2% was observed between 2000 and 2013, with an annual reduction of 0.16%. From 2000 to 2013, trends in resistance to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP) and MDR-TB declined significantly in new TB patients (P < 0.01), but not in retreatment cases. Sputum smear conversion rates after 2 months of treatment decreased significantly, in particular after 2007, in new and retreatment cases. CONCLUSION: INH and RMP resistance and MDR-TB rates declined significantly, suggesting that DOTS-based programmes were successful in reducing drug resistance in new cases but not in retreatment cases. The decreasing sputum smear conversion rates may have been due to an increase in the number of migrants. These two findings suggest that TB is unlikely to be completely eliminated by 2050 in Shenzhen.	DOTS; tuberculosis; trends; MDR-TB; migrants.	
10.5588_ijtld.16.0510	Clinical and bacteriological characteristics associated with clustering of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: The impact of the genetic characteristics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis on the clustering of multi drug -resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has not been analyzed together with clinical and demographic characteristics. OBJECTIVE: To determine factors associated with genotypic clustering of MDR-TB in a community-based study. DESIGN: We measured the proportion of clustered cases among MDR-TB patients and determined the impact of clinical and demographic characteristics and that of three M. tuberculosis genetic characteristics: lineage, drug resistance-associated mutations, and rpoA and rpoC compensatory mutations. RESULTS: Of 174 patients from California and Texas included in the study, the number infected by East-Asian, Euro-American, Indo-Oceanic and East-African-Indian M. tuberculosis lineages were respectively 70 (40.2%), 69 (39.7%), 33 (19.0%) and 2 (1.1%). The most common mutations associated with isoniazid and rifampin resistance were respectively katG S315T and rpoB S531L. Potential compensatory mutations in rpoA and rpoC were found in 35 isolates (20.1%). Hispanic ethnicity (OR 26.50, 95%CI 3.73-386.80), infection with an East-Asian M. tuberculosis lineage (OR 30.00, 95%CI 4.20-462.40) and rpoB mutation S531L (OR 4.03, 95%CI 1.05-23.10) were independent factors associated with genotypic clustering. CONCLUSION: Among the bacterial factors studied, East-Asian lineage and rpoB S531L mutation were independently associated with genotypic clustering, suggesting that bacterial factors have an impact on the ability of M. tuberculosis to cause secondary cases.	community-based study; transmission; molecular epidemiology	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; COMPENSATORY MUTATIONS; RIFAMPICIN RESISTANCE; TRANSMISSION; STRAINS; INFECTION; CHINA; EPIDEMIOLOGY; COUNTRIES

Evidence for preventive therapy following MDR-TB exposure is limited and current guidance is conflicting. An internet-based survey was performed to determine clinical practice in this region. Seventy-two clinicians from 25 countries participated. Practices related to screening and decision-making were highly variable. Just over half provided preventive therapy for children exposed to MDR-TB; the only characteristic associated with provision was practice within the European Union (adjusted OR 4.07, 95%CI 1.33-12.5).

10.1097_MD.0000000000007482	Side effects associated with the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis at a tuberculosis referral hospital in South Korea A retrospective study	Patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis (TB) show good tolerance of the medications used and have few side effects. However, medications used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) have many known side effects. Here, we studied the occurrence of side effects due to treatment of patients with MDR-TB. We conducted a retrospective and consecutive review of the medical records of 256 patients who received treatment for MDR-TB between January 2006 and December 2011. One or more side effects were observed in 95 (37.1%) of the 256 patients. These side effects led to the suspension of the use of 1 or more drugs from the regimen of individualized treatment prescribed for 44 of the patients (17.2%). The side effects observed most frequently included gastrointestinal disturbance (18.4%), psychiatric disorder (5.5%), arthralgia (4.7%), hepatitis (3.9%), peripheral neuropathy (3.1%), hypothyroidism (2.3%), epileptic seizures (2%), dermatological effects (2%), ototoxicity (1.6%), and nephrotoxicity (1.2%). The treatment was successful in 220 (85.9%) patients with MDR-TB. Our study may help in formulating strategies for the timely and aggressive management of drug side effects. This may reduce the suspension of therapy and increase the rate of clinical success.	drug-resistant tuberculosis; side effects; tuberculosis	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; THERAPY; HYPERURICEMIA
10.1016_j.chest.2017.04.155	Defining a Research Agenda to Address the Converging Epidemics of Tuberculosis and Diabetes Part 1: Epidemiology and Clinical Management	There is growing interest in the interaction between type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and TB, but many research questions remain unanswered. Epidemiologists, basic scientists, and clinical experts recently convened and identified priorities. This is the first of two reviews on this topic, summarizing priority areas of research regarding epidemiology, clinical management, and public health. First, from an epidemiologic point of view, more study is needed to determine the importance of transient hyperglycemia in patients with TB and on the importance of DM for the global epidemic of multidrug resistant (MDR)-TB. Second, regarding the screening and clinical management of combined TB and DM (TB-DM), clinical trials and large cohort studies should examine the benefits of improved DM care as well as prolonged or intensified TB treatment on the outcome of TB-DM and investigate the cost-effectiveness of screening methods for DM among patients newly diagnosed with TB. Third, from a public health and health systems point of view, the population health impact and cost-effectiveness of different interventions to prevent or treat DM and TB in high-burden populations should be examined, and health-system interventions should be developed for routine TB-DM screening, management of DM after completion of TB treatment, and better access to DM services worldwide. Studies are needed across different ethnicities and settings given the heterogeneity of metabolic perturbations, inflammatory responses, medications, and access to health care. Finally, studies should address interactions between TB, DM, and HIV because of the convergence of epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa and some other parts of the world.	clinical management; diabetes; epidemiology; public health; tuberculosis	INTERFERON-GAMMA RELEASE; MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; BODY-MASS INDEX; NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; GLYCEMIC CONTROL; INCREASED RISK; MELLITUS; IMPACT; PREVALENCE
10.1128_JCM.02257_16	Use of GeneXpert Remnants for Drug Resistance Profiling and Molecular Epidemiology of Tuberculosis in Libreville, Gabon	Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis pose major problems for global health. The GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) assay rapidly detects resistance to rifampin (RIFr), but for detection of the additional resistance that defines MDR-TB (MDR tuberculosis) and XDR-TB, and for molecular epidemiology, specimen cultures and a biosafe infrastructure are generally required. We sought to determine whether the remnants of sputa prepared for the Xpert assay could be used directly to find mutations associated with drug resistance and to study molecular epidemiology, thus providing precise characterization of MDR-TB cases in countries lacking biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facilities for M. tuberculosis cultures. After sputa were processed and run on the Xpert instrument, the leftovers of the samples prepared for the Xpert assay were used for PCR amplification and sequencing or for a line probe assay to detect mutations associated with resistance to additional drugs, as well as for molecular epidemiology with spoligotyping and selective mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable-number tandem-repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing. Of 130 sputum samples from Gabon tested with the Xpert assay, 124 yielded interpretable results; 21 (17%) of these were determined to be RIFr. Amplification and sequencing or a line probe assay of the Xpert remnants confirmed 18/21 samples as MDR, corresponding to 12/116 (9.5%) new and 6/8 (75%) previously treated TB patients. Spoligotyping and MIRU typing with hypervariable loci identified an MDR Beijing strain present in five samples. We conclude that the remnants of samples processed for the Xpert assay can be used in PCRs to find mutations associated with the resistance to the additional drugs that defines MDR and XDR-TB and to study molecular epidemiology without the need for culturing or a biosafe infrastructure.

This study aims to analyze the drug resistance patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis among the patients in the sanatoria of North Korea, especially during the period when second-line drugs (SLDs) had not yet been officially supplied to this country. The Eugene Bell Foundation (EBF) transferred 947 sputum specimens obtained from 667 patients from 2007 to 2009 to the Clinical Research Center, Masan National Tuberculosis Hospital (MNTH), South Korea. Four hundred ninety-two patients were culture positive for TB (73.8%). Drug susceptibility test (DST) was performed for the bacilli isolated from 489 patients. Over 3 quarters of the cases (76.9%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB. Additionally, 2 patients had extremely drug-resistant (XDR)-TB. Very high resistance to first-line drugs and low resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQs) and injectable drugs (IDs) except for streptomycin (S) were detected. A small but significant regional variation in resistance pattern was observed. Big city regions had higher rate of MDR-TB, higher resistance to FQs and IDs than relatively isolated regions. In conclusion, significant number of drug-resistant TB was detected in North Korean sanatoria, and small but significant regional variations in resistance pattern were noticeable. However, the data in this study do not represent the nationwide drug resistance pattern in North Korea. Further large-scale evaluations are necessary to estimate the resistance pattern of TB in North Korea.	Drug Resistance; North Korea; Tuberculosis	ACID-FAST BACILLI; CETYLPYRIDINIUM CHLORIDE
10.1016_j.tube.2017.03.008	A novel automatic molecular test for detection of multidrug resistance tuberculosis in sputum specimen: A case control study	Minilab tuberculosis (ML TB) assay is a new automatic diagnostic tool for diagnosis of multidrug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB). This study was conducted with aims to know the performance of this assay. Sputum sample from 224 TB suspects was collected from tuberculosis suspects seeking medical care at Beijing Chest hospital. The sputum samples were directly used for smear and ML TB test. The left sputum sample was used to conduct Xpert MTB/RIF, Bactec MGIT culture and drug susceptibility test (DST). All discrepancies between the results from DST, molecular and phenotypic methods were confirmed by DNA Sequencing. The sensitivity and specificity of ML TB test for detecting MTBC from TB suspects were 95.1% and 88.9%, respectively. The sensitivity for smear negative TB suspects was 64.3%. For detection of RIF resistance, the sensitivity and specificity of ML TB test were 89.2% and 95.7%, respectively. For detection of INH resistance, the sensitivity and specificity of ML TB test were 78.3% and 98.1%, respectively. ML TB test showed similar performance to Xpert MTB/RIF for detection of MTBC and RIF resistance. In addition, ML TB also had good performance for INH resistance detection.

10.1371_journal.pone.0177536	The Global Fund in China: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis nationwide programmatic scale-up and challenges to transition to full country ownership	China has the world's second largest burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB; resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin), with an estimated 57,000 cases (range, 48,000-67,000) among notified pulmonary TB patients in 2015. During October 1, 2006 June 30, 2014, China expanded MDR-TB care through a partnership with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund). We analyzed data on site expansion, patient enrolment, treatment outcomes, cost per patient, and overall programme expenditure. China expanded MDR-TB diagnostic and treatment services from 2 prefectures in 2006 to 92 prefectures, covering 921 of the country's 3,000 counties by June 2014. A total of 130,910 patients were tested for MDR-TB, resulting in 13,744 laboratory-confirmed cases, and 9,183 patients started on MDR-TB treatment. Treatment success was 48.4% (2011 cohort). The partnership between China and the Global Fund resulted in enormous gains. However, changes to health system TB delivery and financing coincided with the completion of the Global Fund Programme, and could potentially impact TB and MDR-TB control. Transition to full country financial ownership is proving difficult, with a decline in enrollment and insufficient financial coverage. Given needed improvement to the current treatment success rates, these factors jeopardise investments made for MDR-TB control and care. China now has a chance to cement its status in TB control by strengthening future financing and ensuring ongoing commitment to quality service delivery.		PREVALENCE; CARE
10.1038_s41598_017_03514_1	Efficacy and Safety of Mycobacterium indicus pranii as an adjunct therapy in Category II pulmonary tuberculosis in a randomized trial	Prolonged treatment of tuberculosis (TB) often leads to poor compliance, default and relapse, converting primary TB patients into category II TB (Cat IITB) cases, many of whom may convert to multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB). We have evaluated the immunotherapeutic potential of Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP) as an adjunct to Anti-Tubercular Treatment (ATT) in Cat II pulmonary TB (PTB) patients in a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicentric clinical trial. 890 sputum smear positive Cat II PTB patients were randomized to receive either six intra-dermal injections (2 + 4) of heat-killed MIP at a dose of 5 x 10(8) bacilli or placebo once in 2 weeks for 2 months. Sputum smear and culture examinations were performed at different time points. MIP was safe with no adverse effects. While sputum smear conversion did not show any statistically significant difference, significantly higher number of patients (67.1%) in the MIP group achieved sputum culture conversion at fourth week compared to the placebo (57%) group (p = 0.0002), suggesting a role of MIP in clearance of the bacilli. Since live bacteria are the major contributors for sustained incidence of TB, the potential of MIP in clearance of the bacilli has far reaching implications in controlling the spread of the disease.

10.1080_16549716.2017.1293925	Drug-resistant tuberculosis in Zhejiang Province, China: an updated analysis of time trends, 1999-2013	Background: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) hinder the progress of TB control. Objective: To track the trend of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) prevalence in Zhejiang Province from 1999 to 2013, and identify risk factors of resistance to second-line drugs among MDR-TB patients. Design: Four DR-TB surveys had been done in Zhejiang Province in 1999, 2004, 2008 and 2013 through questionnaires, in which demographic and epidemiological items were included. After questionnaires, drug susceptibility testing (DST) targeted at four first-line drugs was done for all TB patients and DST targeted at six second-line drugs (only in 2008 and 2013) for MDR-TB patients. The drug resistance trend over time was analyzed using the Cochran-Armitage test. The factors associated with resistance to second-line drugs among MDR-TB patients were examined by a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: Of 936 patients enrolled, 27 (3.21%) and 20 (21.28%) MDR-TB cases were registered as new and previously treated cases, respectively. MDR-TB showed a decreasing trend (Z = -3.31, p < 0.01) while resistance to any first-line drugs showed an increasing trend (Z = 5.22, p < 0.001), from 1999 to 2013. The highest resistance rate was shown to ofloxacin among MDR-TB patients both in 2008 (28.8%) and in 2013 (27.7%), while resistance to paraaminosalicylate decreased significantly (Z = -2.06, p = 0.04) between 2008 and 2013. MDR-TB patients aged 45-65 years (OR = 5.00, p = 0.02) were more likely to be resistant to any second-line drugs. Conclusions: DR-TB including MDR-TB remains a major public health problem in Zhejiang Province. Further efforts on MDR-TB control should be conducted to hinder drug resistance, including critical clinical use of anti-TB antibiotics and preventing transmission.	surveillance; multidrug resistant TB; second-line drug resistance	RISK-FACTORS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PREVALENCE; COUNTRIES
10.1016_j.cmi.2017.01.004	Performance of microscopic observation drug susceptibility for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis and detection of drug resistance in Bamako, Mali	Objectives: In Mali early detection and treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis MDR-TB) are still challenging due to the cost, time and/or complexity associated with regular tests. Microscopic Observation Drug Susceptibility MODS) is a low-cost assay validated by WHO in 2010. It is a liquid-culture-based assay to detect the 'cording' characteristic of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and to assess susceptibility to both isoniazid and rifampicin defining multidrug-resistant tuberculosis MDR-TB). In this study we aimed to evaluate the performance of MODS as diagnostic tool compared with a validated methoddMycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube/Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing/Streptomycin, Isoniazid, Rifampicin and Ethambutol MGIT/AST/SIRE). Methods and Results: Between January 2010 and October 2015 we included 98 patients with suspected TB in an observational cohort study. The sensitivity and specificity of MODS assay for detecting TB were respectively 94.12% and 85.71% compared with the reference MGIT/7H11 culture, with a Cohen k coefficient of 0.78 95% CI 0.517-1.043). The median time to culture positivity for MODS assay and MGIT plus interquartile range, IQR) was respectively 8 days IQR 5-11) and 6 days IQR 5-6). In detecting patients with MDR-TB, the sensitivity and specificity of MODS assay were respectively 100% and 95.92%. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were, respectively, 66.7% and 100%. The median turnaround times for obtaining MDR-TB results using MODS assay and MGIT/AST/SIRE was respectively 9 days and 35 days. Hence, the MODS assay rapidly identifies MDR-TB in Mali compared with the MGIT/AST/SIRE. Conclusion: As an easy, simple, fast and affordable method, the MODS assay could significantly improve the management of TB.

10.1590_0074_02760160376	Detection of tuberculosis drug resistance: a comparison by Mycobacterium tuberculosis MLPA assay versus Genotype (R) MTBDRplus	BACKGROUND To cope with the emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), new molecular methods that can routinely be used to screen for a wide range of drug resistance related genetic markers in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome are urgently needed. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the performance of multiplex ligaton-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) against Genotype (R) MTBDRplus to detect resistance to isoniazid (INHr) and rifampicin (RIFr). METHOD 96 culture isolates characterised for identification, drug susceptibility testing (DST) and sequencing of rpoB, katG, and inhA genes were evaluated by the MLPA and Genotype (R) MTBDRplus assays. RESULTS With sequencing as a reference standard, sensitivity (SE) to detect INHr was 92.8% and 85.7%, and specificity (SP) was 100% and 97.5%, for MLPA and Genotype (R) MTBDRplus, respectively. In relation to RIFr, SE was 87.5% and 100%, and SP was 100% and 98.8%, respectively. Kappa value was identical between Genotype (R) MTBDRplus and MLPA compared with the standard DST and sequencing for detection of INHr [0.83 (0.75-0.91)] and RIFr [0.93 (0.88-0.98)]. CONCLUSION Compared to Genotype (R) MTBDRplus, MLPA showed similar sensitivity to detect INH and RIF resistance. The results obtained by the MLPA and Genotype (R) MTBDRplus assays indicate that both molecular tests can be used for the rapid detection of drug-resistant TB with high accuracy. MLPA has the added value of providing information on the circulating M. tuberculosis lineages.	tuberculosis; MLPA; GenoTypeMTBDR (R) plus; isoniazid resistance; rifampicin resistance; multidrug resistance	BRAZIL; SUSCEPTIBILITY; PERFORMANCE; MUTATIONS; RIFAMPIN; STRAINS; GENES; INHA; KATG
pub-0105	Drug-resistant tuberculosis - primary transmission and management	The DOTS strategy assisted global tuberculosis (TB) control, but was unable to prevent the emergence and spread of drug-resistant strains. Genomic evidence confirms the transmission of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in many different settings, indicative of epidemic spread. These findings emphasise the need for enhanced infection control measures in health care and congregate settings. Young children in TB endemic areas are particularly vulnerable. Although advances in TB drug and vaccine development are urgently needed, improved access to currently available preventive therapy and treatment for drug resistant TB could reduce the disease burden and adverse outcomes experienced by children. We review new insights into the transmission dynamics of drug resistant TB, the estimated disease burden in children and optimal management strategies to consider.

10.1016_j.jgar.2017.02.013	Molecular detection of rifampicin resistance by GeneXpert (R) assay among treated and untreated pulmonary tuberculosis patients from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan	Objectives: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is an emerging health problem. Rifampicin (RIF) is the major first-line drug against TB. RIF resistance can be used as a marker for the detection of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). The purpose of this study was to determine the RIF resistance pattern of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates among treated and untreated patients in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Methods: A total of 349 drug-treated and untreated TB-diagnosed patients were enrolled in this study. RIF resistance was detected using a GeneXpert (R) assay for amplification of the RIF resistance-determining region (RRDR) region of the rpoB gene. Results: The overall prevalence of RIF resistance was 5.2% (18/349). Among 49 untreated TB patients, 3 samples (6.1%) were found resistant to RIF. Among 235 patients with a category 1 treatment regimen, 10 samples (4.3%) were resistant to RIF, whilst among 65 patients with a category 2 (Cat-2) treatment regimen, 5 samples (7.7%) were resistant to RIF. A comparison based on patient sex revealed high RIF resistance among male compared with female patients. RIF resistance was highest (4/21; 19.0%) in the 21-40 years age group among Cat-2 patients. Conclusions: The overall prevalence of RIF resistance was high among treated and untreated TB patients. These findings will be helpful for better monitoring and management of RIF resistance in TB patients from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.

10.1128_JCM.02104_16	Direct Detection of Rifampin and Isoniazid Resistance in Sputum Samples from Tuberculosis Patients by High-Resolution Melt Curve Analysis	Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is a major threat to TB control worldwide. Globally, only 40% of the 340,000 notified TB patients estimated to have multidrug-resistant-TB (MDR-TB) were detected in 2015. This study was carried out to evaluate the utility of high-resolution melt curve analysis (HRM) for the rapid and direct detection of MDR-TB in Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum samples. A reference plasmid library was first generated of the most frequently observed mutations in the resistance-determining regions of rpoB, katG, and an inhA promoter and used as positive controls in HRM. The assay was first validated in 25 MDR M. tuberculosis clinical isolates. The assay was evaluated on DNA isolated from 99 M. tuberculosis culture-positive sputum samples that included 84 smear-negative sputum samples, using DNA sequencing as gold standard. Mutants were discriminated from the wild type by comparing melting-curve patterns with those of control plasmids using HRM software. Rifampin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) monoresistance were detected in 11 and 21 specimens, respectively, by HRM. Six samples were classified as MDR-TB by sequencing, one of which was missed by HRM. The HRM-RIF, INH-katG, and INH-inhA assays had 89% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52, 100%), 85% (95% CI, 62, 97%), and 100% (95% CI, 74, 100%) sensitivity, respectively, in smear-negative samples, while all assays had 100% sensitivity in smear-positive samples. All assays had 100% specificity. Concordance of 97% to 100% (kappa value, 0.9 to 1) was noted between sequencing and HRM. Heteroresistance was observed in 5 of 99 samples by sequencing. In conclusion, the HRM assay was a cost-effective (Indian rupee [INR] 400/US$6), rapid, and closed-tube method for the direct detection of MDR-TB in sputum, especially for direct smear-negative cases.

10.1128_JCM.00152_17	Increased Tuberculosis Patient Mortality Associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis Mutations Conferring Resistance to Second-Line Antituberculous Drugs	Rapid molecular diagnostics have great potential to limit the spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) (M/XDR-TB). These technologies detect mutations in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome that confer phenotypic drug resistance. However, there have been few data published regarding the relationships between the detected M. tuberculosis resistance mutations and M/XDR-TB treatment outcomes, limiting our current ability to exploit the full potential of molecular diagnostics. We analyzed clinical, microbiological, and sequencing data for 451 patients and their clinical isolates collected in a multinational, observational cohort study to determine if there was an association between M. tuberculosis resistance mutations and patient mortality. The presence of an rrs 1401G mutation was associated with significantly higher odds of patient mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 5.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65 to 19.84]) after adjusting for relevant patient clinical characteristics and all other resistance mutations. Further analysis of mutations, categorized by the associated resistance level, indicated that the detection of mutations associated with high-level fluoroquinolone (OR, 3.99 [95% CI, 1.10 to 14.40]) and kanamycin (OR, 5.47 [95% CI, 1.64 to 18.24]) resistance was also significantly associated with higher odds of patient mortality, even after accounting for clinical site, patient age, reported smoking history, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, HIV, and all other resistance mutations. Specific gyrA and rrs resistance mutations, associated with high-level resistance, were associated with patient mortality as identified in clinical M. tuberculosis isolates from a diverse M/XDR-TB patient population at three high-burden clinical sites. These results have important implications for the interpretation of molecular diagnostics, including identifying patients at increased risk for mortality during treatment.

The isonicotinyl hydrazone derivatives 12d, 12e and 12f exhibited good anti-tubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv (ATCC #27294) with MIC values of 0.23, 0.24 and 0.24 mu M, respectively, and were also active against SDR-TB, MDR-TB and XDR-TB. More importantly, compound 12e also showed low cytotoxicity and good metabolic stability, and could significantly reduce the mycobacterial burden in a mouse model infected with autoluminescent H37Ra strain, which may serve as a lead compound for further development.

10.1128_AAC.02402_16	Delamanid Kills Dormant Mycobacteria In Vitro and in a Guinea Pig Model of Tuberculosis	Tuberculosis (TB) treatment is long and requires multiple drugs, likely due to various phenotypes of TB bacilli with variable drug susceptibilities. Drugs with broad activity are urgently needed. This study aimed to evaluate delamanid's activity against growing or dormant bacilli in vitro as well as in vivo. Cultures of Mycobacterium bovis BCG Tokyo under aerobic and anaerobic conditions were used to study the activity of delamanid against growing and dormant bacilli, respectively. Delamanid exhibited significant bactericidal activity against replicating and dormant bacilli at or above concentrations of 0.016 and 0.4 mg/liter, respectively. To evaluate delamanid's antituberculosis activity in vivo, we used a guinea pig model of chronic TB infection in which the lung lesions were similar to those in human TB disease. In the guinea pig TB model, a daily dose of 100 mg delamanid/kg of body weight for 4 or 8 weeks demonstrated strong bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Importantly, histological examination revealed that delamanid killed TB bacilli within hypoxic lesions of the lung. The combination regimens containing delamanid with rifampin and pyrazinamide or delamanid with levofloxacin, ethionamide, pyrazinamide, and amikacin were more effective than the standard regimen (rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide). Our data show that delamanid is effective in killing both growing and dormant bacilli in vitro and in the guinea pig TB model. Adding delamanid to current TB regimens may improve treatment outcomes, as demonstrated in recent clinical trials with pulmonary multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB patients. Delamanid may be an important drug for consideration in the construction of new regimens to shorten TB treatment duration.

10.1128_AAC.00239_17	Primary Clofazimine and Bedaquiline Resistance among Isolates from Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Clofazimine has been repurposed for the treatment of tuberculosis, especially for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). To test the susceptibility to clofazimine of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates, MICs of clofazimine were determined using the microplate alamarBlue assay (MABA) method for 80 drug-resistant isolates and 10 drug-susceptible isolates for comparison. For five clofazimine-resistant strains isolated from previously treated pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR- TB) and XDR-TB patients without prior exposure to clofazimine or bedaquiline, clofazimine MICs were >= 1.2 mu g/ml. Four isolates with cross-resistance to bedaquiline had Rv0678 mutations. The other isolate with no resistance to bedaquiline had an Rv1979c mutation. This study adds to a recent study showing that 6.3% of MDR-TB patients without prior clofazimine or bedaquiline exposure harbored isolates with Rv0678 mutations, which raises concern that preexisting resistance to these drugs may be associated with prior TB treatment. Furthermore, we propose a tentative breakpoint of 1.2 >= mu g/ml for clofazimine resistance using the MABA method. More-widespread surveillance and individualized testing for clofazimine and bedaquiline resistance, together with assessment of their clinical usage, especially among previously treated and MDR-TB patients, are warranted.

10.3346_jkms.2017.32.6.954	The Rate of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Korean Children and Adolescents Since 2007	The incidence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) in pediatric populations is a critical indicator of national TB management and treatment strategies. Limited data exist regarding the rate of pediatric DR-TB. In this study, we aimed to analyze the status of DR-TB in Korean children from 2007 to 2013. We analyzed specimens submitted to the Korean Institute of Tuberculosis using Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture and drug susceptibility tests (DSTs) from January 2007 through December 2013. Specimens from patients <= 19 years of age were included. Among the 2,690 cases, 297 cases were excluded because of insufficient data, leaving 2,393 cases for the final analysis. In total, resistance to one or more TB drugs was 13.5%. The resistance rates of each of the drugs were as follows: isoniazid (INH) 10.2%, rifampin (RFP) 5.1%, ethambutol (EMB) 3.7%, and pyrazinamide (PZA) 3.1%. The resistance rate of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was 4.2%, and that of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) was 0.8%. The overall drug resistance rate demonstrated significant increase throughout the study period (P<0.001) but showed no significant difference compared to previous study from 1999 to 2007. The drug resistance rate of PZA in <= 15 years of age group was significantly greater than that of > 15 years (P < 0.001). The drug resistance rate has increased throughout the study period.

10.1111_tmi.12875	Spoligotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates at a tertiary care hospital in India	ObjectiveSpoligotyping is a valuable genotyping tool to study the genetic diversity and molecular epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb). The aim of this study was to analyse different spoligotype patterns of M. tb strains isolated from patients with tuberculosis from different parts of India. Materials and MethodsA total of 163 M. tb isolates were spoligotyped between January 2014 and January 2015. About 47% (n = 77) were from patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis; of these, 10 were MDR, and seven were Pre-XDR. Of the 86 M. tb isolates from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, 25 were MDR, and 25 were Pre-XDR. ResultsWe found 61 spoligo patterns, 128 clusters in the spoligotype data base (spoldb4 data base) with spoligo international type (SIT) number and 35 true unique isolates. The most pre-dominant spoligotype was EAI lineage (56), followed by Beijing (28), CAS (20), T(9), U(7), X(3), H(3), BOVIS_1 BCG(1) and LAM(1). ConclusionAlthough our study identified EAI, CAS and Beijing strain lineages as pre-dominant, we also found a large number of orphan strains (20%) in our study. Beijing strains were more significantly associated with MDR TB than CAS and EAI lineages. Further studies on large sample sizes would help to clearly describe the epidemiology of M. tb in India.

10.5588_ijtld.17.0135	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment programmes insufficiently consider comorbid mental disorders	The successful treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global health priority and a key pillar of the World Health Organization's (WHO's) End TB strategy. There has been significant global investment in diagnostic capabilities in recent years. However, we argue that the mental distress of those with MDR-TB and their families continues to be overlooked by TB programmes. Priorities in the End TB Strategy of 'patient-centred care' and 'patient support' are still to be delivered in practice in many low-income settings, and in particular consideration of mental distress. Our experience of undertaking MDR-TB operational research in China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Swaziland has given us detailed insight into the challenges facing patients, their families, health professionals and wider health systems. We are increasingly concerned that psychosocial support, and particularly support focused on mental health, is being insufficiently addressed in national MDR-TB programmes. We suggest that the presence of comorbid mental disorders reduces treatment adherence. We recommend the trial ling within TB programmes of brief screening tools for common mental disorders and the incorporation of principles from the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme programme into TB programme treatment guidance. Our work in Nepal also suggests that brief psychological counselling delivered by non-specialist counsellors may be feasible.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; mental health; patient support; treatment adherence	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; METAANALYSIS; DEPRESSION; REGIMEN; HEALTH; CARE; BANGLADESH
10.1016_j.ijantimicag.2017.01.024	Population pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin, cycloserine, p-aminosalicylic acid and kanamycin for the treatment of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis	Control of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) requires extensive, supervised chemotherapy because second-line anti-TB drugs have a narrower therapeutic range than first-line drugs. This study aimed to develop population pharmacokinetic (PK) models for second-line drugs in patients with MDR-TB, evaluate the recommended dosage regimens and, if necessary, suggest new dosage regimens. A prospective, single-centre PK study was performed on second-line anti-TB drugs in patients with MDR-TB. Moxifloxacin, cycloserine, p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS), kanamycin and other second-line drugs were administered to the patients. Plasma concentrations were analysed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Population PK models were developed using non-linear mixed effect modelling (NONMEM, Version 7.30; ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, USA). Simulations were performed using the calculated PK parameters. The respective absorption rate constant, apparent clearance and apparent volume of distribution values were as follows: 0.305/h, 9.37 L/h and 56.7 L for moxifloxacin; 0.135/h, 1.38 L/h and 10.5 L for cycloserine; 0.510/h, 30.8 L/h and 79.4 L for PAS; and 1.67/h, 3.75 L/h and 15.2 L for kanamycin. The simulations showed that the following dosage regimens were more likely to be within the recommended concentration ranges than the raw data in this study: 200 mg of moxifloxacin once daily (QD) (patient weight <50 kg) and 400 mg of moxifloxacin QD (patient weight >= 50 kg), 500-750 mg of cycloserine QD, 4.95-6.6 g of PAS twice daily and 750-1000 mg of intramuscular kanamycin QD. These findings indicate that the recommended doses should be revised to improve the clinical outcomes of MDR-TB treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy.

10.1016_j.meegid.2017.02.012	Quadruple-first line drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Vietnam: What can we learn from genes?	In Vietnam, a country with high tuberculosis (137/100.000 population) and multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB burdens (7.8/100.000 population), little is known about the molecular signatures of drug resistance in general and more particularly of second line drug (SLD) resistance. This study is specifically focused on mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates resistant to four first-line drugs (FLDs) that make TB much more difficult to treat. The aim is to determine the proportion of SLD resistance in these quadruple drug resistant isolates and the genetic determinants linked to drug resistance to better understand the genetic processes leading to quadruple and extremely drug resistance (XDR). 91 quadruple (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and streptomycin) FLD resistant and 55 susceptible isolates were included. Spoligotyping and 24-locus MIRU-VNTR techniques were performed and 9 genes and promoters linked to FLD and SLD resistance were sequenced. SW susceptibility testing was carried out on a subsample of isolates. High proportion of quadruple-FLD resistant isolates was resistant to fluoroquinolones (27%) and second-line injectable drugs (302%) by drug susceptibility testing. The sequencing revealed high mutation diversity with prevailing mutations at positions katG315, inhA-15, rpoB531, embB306, rrs1401, rpsL43 and gyrA94. The sensitivity and specificity were high for most drug resistances (>86%), but the sensitivity was lower for injectable drug resistances (<69%). The mutation patterns revealed 23.1% of pre-XDR and 7.7% of XDR isolates, mostly belonging to Beijing family. The genotypic diversity and the variety of mutations reflect the existence of various evolutionary paths leading to FLD and SLD resistance. Nevertheless, particular mutation patterns linked to high-level resistance and low fitness costs seem to be favored. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

10.1186_s12879_017_2489_3	Diagnostic accuracy and usefulness of the Genotype MTBDRplus assay in diagnosing multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Cameroon? a cross-sectional study	Background: Drug-resistant tuberculosis, especially multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), is a major public health problem. Effective management of MDR-TB relies on accurate and rapid diagnosis. In this study, we assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the Genotype MTBDRplus assay in diagnosing MDR-TB in Cameroon, and then discuss on its utility within the diagnostic algorithm for MDR-TB. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 225 isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultured from sputum samples collected from new and previously treated pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Cameroon were used to determine the accuracy of the Genotype MTBDRplus assay. We compared the results of the Genotype MTBDRplus assay with those from the automated liquid culture BACTEC MGIT 960 SIRE system for sensitivity, specificity, and degree of agreement. The pattern of mutations associated with resistance to RIF and INH were also analyzed. Results: The Genotype MTBDRplus assay correctly identified Rifampicin (RIF) resistance in 48/49 isolates (sensitivity, 98% [CI, 89%-100%]), Isoniazid (INH) resistance in 55/60 isolates (sensitivity 92% [CI, 82%-96%]), and MDR-TB in 46/49 (sensitivity, 94% [CI, 83%-98%]). The specificity for the detection of RIF-resistant and MDR-TB cases was 100% (CI, 98%-100%), while that of INH resistance was 99% (CI, 97%-100%). The agreement between the two tests for the detection of MDR-TB was very good (Kappa = 0.96 [CI, 0.92-1.00]). Among the 3 missed MDR-TB cases, the Genotype MTBDRplus assay classified two samples as RIF-monoresistant and one as INH monoresistant. The most frequent mutations detected by the Genotype MTBDRplus assay was the rpoB S531 L MUT3 41/49 (84%) in RIF-resistant isolates, and the KatG S315 T1 (MUT1) 35/55 (64%) and inhA C15T (MUT1) 20/55 (36%) mutations in INH-resistant isolates. Conclusion: The Genotype MTBDRplus assay had good accuracy and could be used for the diagnosis of MDR-TB in Cameroon. For routine MDR-TB diagnosis, this assay could be used for Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures containing contaminants, to complement culture-based drug susceptibility testing or to determine drug resistant mutations.

10.12659_MSM.904682	Adverse Events Associated with Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in China: An Ambispective Cohort Study	Background: Adverse events are under-appreciated negative consequences that are significant clinical problems for patients undergoing anti-MDR-TB treatment due to longer duration of treatment and more need for concurrent use of multiple second-line drugs. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of adverse events and their impact on MDR-TB therapy and treatment outcome, and to identify possible drug-event pairs in China. Material/Methods: An ambispective cohort study was conducted based on hospital medical records, which included a retrospective study that enrolled 751 MDR-TB patients receiving standardized regimen between May 2009 and July 2013, and a follow-up investigation of treatment outcome conducted in December 2016 in China. Adverse events were determined according to laboratory results or clinical criteria. Cox's proportional hazards regression models were used for evaluating associations. Results: There were 681(90.7%) patients experienced at least 1 type of adverse event and 55.2% of them required a changed MDR-TB treatment; 51(6.8%) patients required permanent discontinuation of the offending drug due to adverse events. The occurrence of adverse events was associated with poor treatment outcome (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.54; 95% CI 1.21, 1.87). A total of 10 different drug-event pairs were identified. Conclusions: Adverse events occurred commonly during MDR-TB treatment in China, and often resulted in MDR-TB treatment change. The occurrence of adverse events affected MDR-TB poor outcome after treatment.	China; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Tuberculosis, Avian	MDR-TB; LATVIA
10.1371_journal.pone.0177167	Performance of TaqMan array card to detect TB drug resistance on direct specimens	Culture based phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is time consuming therefore rapid genotypic methods are increasingly being utilized. We previously developed and evaluated on TB isolates a rapid genotypic TaqMan array card (TAC) that detects mutations in several resistance-associated genes using dozens of primer pairs, probes, and high resolution melt analysis, with >96% accuracy versus Sanger sequencing. In this study we examined the performance of TAC on sputum, comparing results between 71 paired sputum and TB isolates of which 62 were MDR-TB. We also adapted the TAC to include wild-type probes and broadened coverage for rpoB and gyrA mutations. TAC was 89% successful at detecting wild-type or mutations within inhA, katG, rpoB, eis, gyrA, rplC, and pncA on smear positive sputa and 33% successful on smear negative sputa. The overall accuracy of these detections as compared to the TAC results of the paired isolate was 95% +/- 7 (average sensitivity 98% +/- 3; specificity 92% +/- 14). Accuracy of sputum TAC results versus phenotypic DST for isoniazid, rifampin, ofloxacin/moxifloxacin, and pyrazinamide was 85% +/- 12. This was similar to that of the isolate TAC results (accuracy 88% +/- 13), thus inaccuracies primarily reflected intrinsic genotypic-phenotypic discordance. The TAC is a rapid, modular, comprehensive, and accurate TB DST for the major first and second line TB drugs and could be used for supplemental testing of GeneXpert resistant smear positive sputum.

10.1371_journal.pone.0176660	A combination of baseline plasma immune markers can predict therapeutic response in multidrug resistant tuberculosis	Objective To identify plasma markers predictive of therapeutic response in patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Methods Fifty HIV-negative patients with active pulmonary MDR-TB were analysed for six soluble analytes in plasma at the time of initiating treatment (baseline) and over six months thereafter. Patients were identified as sputum culture positive or negative at baseline. Culture positive patients were further stratified by the median time to sputum culture conversion (SCC) as fast responders (< 76 days) or slow responders (>= 76 days). Chest X-ray scores, body mass index, and sputum smear microscopy results were obtained at baseline. Results Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed that baseline plasma levels of IP-10/ CXCL10, VEGF-A, SAA and CRP could distinguish sputum culture and cavitation status of patients. Among patients who were culture positive at baseline, there were significant positive correlations between plasma levels of CRP, SAA, VEGF-A, sIL-2R alpha/CD40, and IP-10 and delayed SCC. Using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Receiver Operating Curves (ROC), we showed that a combination of MCP-1/CCL2, IP-10, sIL-2R alpha, SAA, CRP and AFB smear could distinguish fast from slow responders and were predictive of delayed SCC with high sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion Plasma levels of specific chemokines and inflammatory markers measured before MDR-TB treatment are candidate predictive markers of delayed SCC. These findings require validation in a larger study.

10.1183_13993003.00387_2017	Effectiveness and safety of bedaquiline-containing regimens in the treatment of MDR- and XDR-TB: a multicentre study	Large studies on bedaquiline used to treat multidrug-resistant (MDR-) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) are lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of bedaquiline-containing regimens in a large, retrospective, observational study conducted in 25 centres and 15 countries in five continents. 428 culture-confirmed MDR-TB cases were analysed (61.5% male; 22.1% HIV-positive, 45.6% XDR-TB). MDR-TB cases were admitted to hospital for a median (interquartile range (IQR)) 179 (92-280) days and exposed to bedaquiline for 168 (86-180) days. Treatment regimens included, among others, linezolid, moxifloxacin, clofazimine and carbapenems (82.0%, 58.4%, 52.6% and 15.3% of cases, respectively). Sputum smear and culture conversion rates in MDR-TB cases were 63.6% and 30.1%, respectively at 30 days, 81.1% and 56.7%, respectively at 60 days; 85.5% and 80.5%, respectively at 90 days and 88.7% and 91.2%, respectively at the end of treatment. The median (IQR) time to smear and culture conversion was 34 (30-60) days and 60 (33-90) days. Out of 247 culture-confirmed MDR-TB cases completing treatment, 71.3% achieved success (62.4% cured; 8.9% completed treatment), 13.4% died, 7.3% defaulted and 7.7% failed. Bedaquiline was interrupted due to adverse events in 5.8% of cases. A single case died, having electrocardiographic abnormalities that were probably non-bedaquiline related. Bedaquiline-containing regimens achieved high conversion and success rates under different nonexperimental conditions.

10.1177_1010539517700474	Drug Resistance in Newly Presenting and Previously Treated Tuberculosis Patients in Guangxi Province, People's Republic of China	Drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains are a major threat to the control of tuberculosis (TB), but the prevalence of drug-resistant TB is still unknown in the southern ethnic region of China. A cluster-randomized sampling method was used to include the study population. Isolates were tested for resistance to 6 antituberculosis drugs, and genotyped to identify Beijing strains. Overall, 11.3% (139/1229) of new cases and 33.0% (126/382) of retreated cases had drug-resistant tuberculosis. Multiple previous TB treatment episodes and multiple treatment interruptions were risk factors for both drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant TB among retreated cases. A total of 53.2% of the patients were infected with a Beijing strain of M tuberculosis. Infection with a Beijing strain was significantly associated with drug resistance among new cases (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.01-2.07). Novel strategies to rapid diagnosis and effective treatment are urgently needed to prevent the development of drug resistance.	tuberculosis; drug-resistant; MDR-TB; Beijing genotype; ethnic region	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; BEIJING GENOTYPE; STRAINS
10.1016_j.ijantimicag.2017.02.008	Old antibiotics for emerging multidrug-resistant/extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/XDR-TB)	Recently, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has become a therapeutic challenge. In addition to drug resistance, drug adverse events, intravenous delivery, cost and availability of some antibiotics in low-income countries have led to a look back to old drugs, especially those efficient against closely related organisms such as Mycobacterium leprae. Here we review the available drugs that respect the conditions above and could be upgraded to first-line therapy for treating MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).

10.1016_j.arbres.2016.10.021	Diabetes is Associated with Severe Adverse Events in Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Introduction: Diabetes mellitus (DM), a very common disease in Mexico, is a well-known risk factor for tuberculosis (TB). However, it is not known by which extentDM predisposes to adverse events (AE) to anti TB drugs and/or to worse outcomes in patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB). The main objective of this study was to describe the outcomes of TB treatment, the impact of DM and the prevalence of AE in a cohort of patients with MDR-/XDR pulmonary TB treated at the national TB referral centre in Mexico City. Results: Ninety patients were enrolled between 2010 and 2015: 73 with MDR-TB (81.1%), 11 with pre-XDR-TB (12.2%) and 6 (6.7%) with XDR-TB, including 49 (54.4%) with DM, and 3 with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) co-infection (3.3%). In 98% of patients, diagnosis was made by culture and drug susceptibility testing, while in a single case the diagnosis was made by a molecular test. The presence of DM was associated with an increased risk of serious drug-related AEs, such as nephrotoxicity (Odds Ratio [OR] = 6.5; 95% Confidence Interval [95% CI]: 1.9-21.8) and hypothyroidism (OR= 8.8; 95% CI: 1.8-54.2), but not for a worse outcome. Conclusions: Our data suggest that DM does not impact second-line TB treatment outcomes, but patients with DM have a higher risk of developing serious AEs to drug-resistant TB treatment, such as nephrotoxicity and hypothyroidism.

10.1016_j.tube.2017.02.006	Genotyping and rifampicin and isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium bovis strains isolated from the lymph nodes of slaughtered cattle	In developing nations, 10-20% of the human cases of tuberculosis are caused by Mycobacterium bovis. However, this percentage may be underestimated because most laboratories in developing countries do not routinely perform mycobacterial cultures, and only a few have the systems in place to identify M. bovis. There are few studies investigating genotypic diversity and drug resistance in M. bovis from animal and/or human infections. The genotypic diversity of M. bovis strains obtained from bovine lymph nodes were investigated by spacer oligonucleotide typing (spoligotyping) and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unite-variable-number tandem repeat typing (MIRU-VNTR). The phenotypic resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin and MIC values of the isolates were determined using the resazurin microtiter assay plate method (REMA). The evaluation of the possible genetic basis for such resistance was performed with GenoType MTBDRplus. Sixty-seven isolates were obtained, of which 11 (16%) were MDR-TB, 8 (12%) were isoniazid-resistant, and 2 (3%) were rifampicin-resistant. Mutations associated with drug resistance were not found. Genotyping techniques enabled the grouping of the strains into 12 clusters and 21 isolates with unique profiles. The high frequency of M. bovis reinforces the impact of the pathogen as a major causal agent of bovine tuberculosis in the study area. The resistance of the strains to drugs used for first-line treatment of human tuberculosis raises public health concerns. Further studies are required to elucidate the basis of drug resistance and genotypic diversity in M. bovis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.5588_ijtld.16.0544	Tuberculosis resistance-conferring mutations with fitness cost among HIV-positive individuals in Uganda	BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is considered to be less transmissible due to the fitness cost associated with drug resistance-conferring mutations in essential genes. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that TB drug resistance-conferring mutations with fitness cost are more frequent among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive than among HIV-negative patients. DESIGN: We analysed all strains from the two TB drug resistance surveys conducted in Uganda between 2008 and 2011. Strains phenotypically susceptible to rifampicin and/or isoniazid were assumed to be wild-type; in all other cases, we performed whole-genome sequencing. Mutations at the rpoB531 and katG315 codons were considered without fitness loss, whereas other rpoB codons and non-katG were considered with fitness loss. RESULTS: Of the 897 TB patients, 286 (32.1%) were HIV-positive. Mutations with fitness loss in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients were respectively as follows: non-531 rpoB: 1.03% (n = 3), 0.71% (n = 4) (OR 1.46, 95%CI 0.58-3.68); non-katG: 0.40% (n=1), 1.0% (n = 6) (OR 0.40, 95%CI 0.07-2.20); rpoB531: 1.49% (n = 4), 0.69% (n = 4) (OR 2.29, 95%CI 0.83-5.77); katG315: 3.86% (n = 11), 2.55% (n = 15) (OR 1.54, 95%CI 0.81-2.90). The odds of mutations with and without fitness cost were higher for patients with a history of previous anti-tuberculosis treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support the hypothesis that resistance-conferring mutations with fitness cost are likely to be often present in HIV-positive individuals.

10.5588_ijtld.16.0779	Drug-resistant tuberculosis in patients with minimal symptoms: favourable outcomes in the absence of treatment	SETTING: Referral hospital for drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical outcomes of patients (age 14 years) with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of DR-TB who had minimal symptoms and/or did not have chest radiographic evidence of active disease at referral. These patients were not started on treatment, but were enrolled in an observation programme with follow-up at 2, 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Of 3345 referred patients diagnosed with DR-TB, 192 (6%) were enrolled in the observation programme. The median duration from initial sputum collection in primary care to examination at our hospital was 92 days (IQR 64-124). After 12 months, 120 (62%) patients were well, 36 (19%) were lost to follow-up, 30 (16%) had deteriorated and were started on second-line anti-tuberculosis treatment and 6 (3%) had died. Bilateral disease (OR 4.25, 95%CI 1.14-15.77, P = 0.030) and previous TB (OR 2.14, 95 %CI 1.10-4.19, P = 0.026) were independent predictors of an unfavourable end result in a multivariate model. CONCLUSION: In our high-burden setting, most patients diagnosed with DR-TB who had minimal symptoms at referral remained well without treatment. Longitudinal observation, coupled with symptom checking and chest radiograph, is a viable strategy.	asymptomatic; management; human immunodeficiency virus	SOUTH-AFRICA; MDR-TB; COMPLETENESS
10.1016_j.thorsurg.2017.01.003	Thoracoplasty for Tuberculosis in the Twenty-first Century	A new modification of osteoplastic collapse thoracoplasty performed with a minimally invasive approach has been proposed. This operation is a variant of extrapleural thoracoplasty used in the treatment of destructive tuberculosis. The benefits of the proposed method, the surgical techniques, and the results of the authors' research are described. Compared with the conventional variant of osteoplastic thoracoplasty, the rates of bacteriologic conversion (odds ratio [OR], 1.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72-1.97) and of the closure of cavities (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.98-2.28) have been proved to be higher when the operation is performed with a minimally invasive approach.

10.1017_S0950268817000267	Isolation unit for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients in a low endemic country, a step towards the World Health Organization End TB Strategy	Tuberculosis (TB) remains a threat to public health and is the second cause of death due to a single infectious agent after HIV/AIDS. The worldwide distribution of TB is heterogeneous. The incidence is decreasing in most high-income regions, but the situation remains worrying in many parts of the world. The emergence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to key agents used in treatment (rifampin and isoniazid) contributes to TB transmission around the world. To achieve TB elimination, both high and low endemic countries must upscale their efforts to decrease disease transmission and improve cure rates. Management of drug-resistant TB is of particular importance. In this paper, we discuss the different models of care of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), the ethical considerations and the specific constraints present in high income countries. The management model chosen by the Belgian TB specialists in accordance with public health authorities as well as building of a specific MDR/XDR-TB isolation unit are also discussed.

10.1080_17476348.2017.1309294	Overcoming challenges in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of pediatric drug-resistant tuberculosis	Introduction: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is a growing global health threat and children are especially vulnerable to becoming infected and sick with DR-TB. There is a growing body of evidence on the optimal diagnosis, treatment and prevention of DR-TB in this vulnerable population.Areas covered: A comprehensive review of the literature on DR-TB in children was done using PubMed and Ovid databases up to 31 December 2016. Topic areas covered included diagnosis of DR-TB, treatment of DR-TB - including novel medications and regimens, prevention of DR-TB, community-based care, and stigma/discrimination. After presenting a case that highlights some of these challenges in each of these areas, for which we will propose mechanisms for overcoming them.Expert commentary: Overcoming the challenges facing children with DR-TB, requires a paradigm shift at multiple levels. The trickle down' approach to pediatric DR-TB has been woefully inadequate and it is essential that pediatric DR-TB - preventing it, diagnosing it, and treating it - be made a priority.

10.3389_fmicb.2017.00711	Interplay between Mutations and Efflux in Drug Resistant Clinical Isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Numerous studies show efflux as a universal bacterial mechanism contributing to antibiotic resistance and also that the activity of the antibiotics subject to efflux can be enhanced by the combined use of efflux inhibitors. Nevertheless, the contribution of efflux to the overall drug resistance levels of clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is poorly understood and still is ignored by many. Here, we evaluated the contribution of drug efflux plus target-gene mutations to the drug resistance levels in clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. A panel of 17 M. tuberculosis clinical strains were characterized for drug resistance associated mutations and antibiotic profiles in the presence and absence of efflux inhibitors. The correlation between the effect of the efflux inhibitors and the resistance levels was assessed by quantitative drug susceptibility testing. The bacterial growth/survival vs. growth inhibition was analyzed through the comparison between the time of growth in the presence and absence of an inhibitor. For the same mutation conferring antibiotic resistance, different MICs were observed and the different resistance levels found could be reduced by efflux inhibitors. Although susceptibility was not restored, the results demonstrate the existence of a broad-spectrum synergistic interaction between antibiotics and efflux inhibitors. The existence of efflux activity was confirmed by real-time fluorometry. Moreover, the efflux pump genes mmr, mmpL7, Rv1258c, p55, and efpA were shown to be overexpressed in the presence of antibiotics, demonstrating the contribution of these efflux pumps to the overall resistance phenotype of the M. tuberculosis clinical isolates studied, independently of the genotype of the strains. These results showed that the drug resistance levels of multi-and extensively-drug resistant M. tuberculosis clinical strains are a combination between drug efflux and the presence of target-gene mutations, a reality that is often disregarded by the tuberculosis specialists in favor of the almost undisputed importance of antibiotic target-gene mutations for the resistance in M. tuberculosis.	tuberculosis; synergism; efflux inhibitors; TB eXIST; time to detection	HIGH-LEVEL RESISTANCE; PUMP GENE-EXPRESSION; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; FLUOROQUINOLONE RESISTANCE; ANTITUBERCULOSIS AGENTS; RPOB MUTATIONS; MIRU-VNTRPLUS; MURINE MODEL; MGIT 960; MDR-TB
10.1186_s12879_017_2409_6	Early detection of multidrug- and pre-extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis from smear-positive sputum by direct sequencing	Background: Emergence of multidrug-and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (M/XDR-TB) is a major hurdle for TB control programs especially in developing countries like China. Resistance to fluoroquinolones is high among MDR-TB patients. Early diagnosis of MDR/pre-XDR-TB is essential for lowering transmission of drug-resistant TB and adjusting the treatment regimen. Methods: Smear-positive sputum specimens (n = 186) were collected from Wuhan Institute for Tuberculosis Control. The DNA was extracted from the specimens and run through a Sanger sequencing assay to detect mutations associated with MDR/pre-XDR-TB including the rpoB core region for rifampicin (RIF) resistance; katG and inhA promoter for isoniazid (INH) resistance; and gyrA for fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance. Sequencing data were compared to phenotypic Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) proportion method drug susceptibility testing (DST) results for performance analysis. Results: By comparing the mutation data with phenotypic results, the detection rates of MDR-TB and pre-XDR-TB were 84.31% (43/51) and 83.33% (20/24), respectively. The sequencing assay illustrated good sensitivity for the detection of resistance to RIF (96.92%), INH (86.89%), FQ (77.50%). The specificities of the assay were 98.35% for RIF, 99.20% for INH, and 97.26% for FQ. Conclusions: The sequencing assay is an efficient, accurate method for detection of MDR-TB and pre-XDR-TB from clinical smear-positive sputum specimens, should be considered as a supplemental method for obtaining early DST results before the availability of phenotypic DST results. This could be of benefit to early diagnosis, adjusting the treatment regimen and controlling transmission of drug-resistant TB.

10.1038_s41598_017_01213_5	Diabetes mellitus and the risk of multidrug resistant tuberculosis: a meta-analysis	The high prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) among multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients is a serious cause for concern. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether DM is an independent risk factor for MDR-TB. Electronic literature searches of the PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE databases up to July 12, 2016 were conducted. The pooled adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random effects model with STATA 12.0 software. In total 13 studies, including 9289 individuals with TB, were included in this meta-analysis. Significant association between DM and MDR-TB (OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.32, 2.22) was identified. Subgroup analyses showed that: 1) Pooled OR was 1.25 (95% CI: 0.82-1.91) for cross-sectional studies, and was 2.14 (95% CI: 1.51-3.02) for longitudinal studies; 2) The pooled OR was 1.69 (95% CI: 1.09-2.62) for primary MDR-TB, 1.94 (95% CI: 1.42-2.65) for any MDR-TB, and 0.85 for secondary MDR-TB (95% CI: 0.29-2.54); 3) DM was significantly associated with MDR-TB in both Caucasian (OR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.66-3.07) and Asian (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.01-1.95) subgroups. No evidence of publication bias was identified. In conclusion, the pooling analysis indicated that DM was an independent risk factor for MDR-TB, especially for primary MDR-TB.

10.1186_s12879_017_2389_6	Evaluation of genotype MTBDRplus VER 2.0 line probe assay for the detection of MDR-TB in smear positive and negative sputum samples	Background: Multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) poses formidable challenges to TB control due to its complex diagnostic and treatment challenges and often associated with a high rate of mortality. Accurate and rapid detection of MDR-TB is critical for timely initiation of treatment. Line Probe Assay (LPA) is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test based on DNA-STRIP technology for the identification of the M. tuberculosis complex and its resistance to rifampicin (RMP) and/or isoniazid (INH). Hain Lifescience, GmbH, Germany has improved the sensitivity of Genotype MTBDRplus VER 2.0 LPA for the detection of MDR-TB; with the possibility of applying the tool in smear negative sputum samples. Method: A cross sectional study was conducted on 274 presumptive MDR-TB patients referred to the National TB Reference Laboratory (NTRL), Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) who submitted sputum samples for laboratory diagnosis of drug resistant-TB testing. Seventy-two smear and culture positive samples processed in smear positive direct LPA category and 197 smear negative sputum samples were processed for direct LPA. Among the smear negative samples 145 (73.6%) were culture negative and 26 (13.2%) were culture positive. All specimens were processed using NALC-NaOH method and ZN smear microscopy done from sediments. Genotype MTBDRplus VER 2.0 done from processed sputum sediments and the result was compared against the reference, BACTEC MGIT 960 culture and DST. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of Genotype MTBDRplus VER 2.0 assay was determined and P-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of Genotype MTBDRplus VER 2.0 LPA were 96.4, 100, 100 and 96.9%, respectively for the detection of MDR-TB from direct smear positive sputum samples. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of Genotype MTBDR plus VER 2.0 LPA were 77.8, 97.2, 82.4 and 97.2%, respectively, for the detection of M. tuberculosis from direct smear negative sputum samples. Fourteen (53.8%) samples had valid results with LPA among the 26 smear negative culture positive samples. The remaining 8 (30.8%) and 4 (15.4%) were invalid and negative with LPA, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of Genotype MTBDRplus VER 2.0 LPA were 100% for the detection of MDR-TB among 14 direct smear negative and culture positive sputum samples. The most common mutations associated with RMP and INH resistance were S531L and S315TL, respectively. A single rare mutation (C15T/A16G) was detected for INH resistance. Conclusion: The diagnostic performance of Genotype MTBDRplus VER 2.0 LPA in direct smear positive sputum sample was highly sensitive and specific for early detection of MDR-TB. However, the diagnostic performance of this molecular assay in direct smear negative sputum sample was low and showed a high level of invalid results for detection of M. tuberculosis and its resistance to RMP and/or INH so it is unlikely to implement Genotype MTBDRplus VER 2.0 for the detection of MDR-TB in direct smear negative sample in our routine settings. The sensitivity of the assay should be improved for detection of MDR-TB in direct smear negative sputum specimens.

10.1186_s12879_017_2343_7	Assessments of serum copper and zinc concentration, and the Cu/Zn ratio determination in patients with multidrug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Cote d'Ivoire	Background: In Cote d'Ivoire, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a serious public health problem with a prevalence estimated at 2.5% in 2006. Zinc and copper are essential Trace element needed to strengthen the immune system and also useful in the fight against tuberculosis. The Cu / Zn ratio is a good indicator of oxidative stress. The principal aim of this study was to evaluate the serum concentration of some trace element and determine the Cu / Zn ratio in patients with multidrug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (MDR-TB) before and after second line treatment of TB. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 100 MDR-TB patients after confirmation of their status through the microscopic and molecular diagnosis of resistance to Isoniazid and Rifampicin by GeneXpert. The concentration level of zinc and copper were determined using flame air / acetylene atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS) Type Varian Spectr AA-20 Victoria, Australlia. Results: A significant decrease in zinc levels (P < 0.05) and an increased Cu / Zn ratio (P < 0.05) was observed in MDR-TB patients compared to controls TB free. During treatment a significant reduction in Cu / Zn ratio (P < 0.05) was observed compared to the initial result. Conclusions: The decrease in serum zinc level and the high Cu / Zn ratio could explain the immune system dysfunction and the high level of oxidative stress in patients with MDR-TB. Therefore the evaluation of the zinc and copper status could represent essential parameters in monitoring of TB second line treatment for better treatment management.

10.1186_s12913_017_2191_6	High pre-diagnosis attrition among patients with presumptive MDR-TB: an operational research from Bhopal district, India	Background: Pre-diagnosis attrition needs to be addressed urgently if we are to make progress in improving MDR-TB case detection and achieve universal access to MDR-TB care. We report the pre-diagnosis attrition, along with factors associated, and turnaround times related to the diagnostic pathway among patient with presumptive MDR-TB in Bhopal district, central India (2014). Methods: Study was conducted under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme setting. It was a retrospective cohort study involving record review of all registered TB cases in Bhopal district that met the presumptive MDR-TB criteria (eligible for DST) in 2014. In quarter 1, Line Probe Assay (LPA) was used if sample was smear/culture positive. Quarter 2 onwards, LPA and Cartridge-based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CbNAAT) was used for smear positive and smear negative samples respectively. Pre-diagnosis attrition was defined as failure to undergo DST among patients with presumptive MDR-TB (as defined by the programme). Results: Of 770 patients eligible for DST, 311 underwent DST and 20 patients were diagnosed as having MDR-TB. Pre-diagnosis attrition was 60% (459/770). Among those with pre-diagnosis attrition, 91% (417/459) were not identified as 'presumptive MDR-TB' by the programme. TAT [median (IQR)] to undergo DST after eligibility was 4 (0, 10) days. Attrition was more than 40% across all subgroups. Age more than 64 years; those from a medical college; those eligible in quarter 1; patients with presumptive criteria ` previously treated -recurrent TB', ` treatment after loss-to-follow-up' and ` previously treated-others'; and patients with extra-pulmonary TB were independent risk factors for not undergoing DST. Conclusion: High pre-diagnosis attrition was contributed by failure to identify and refer patients. Attrition reduced modestly with time and one factor that might have contributed to this was introduction of CbNAAT in quarter 2 of 2014. General health system strengthening which includes improvement in identification/referral and patient tracking with focus on those with higher risk for not undergoing DST is urgently required.

10.1016_S2213_2600_17_30079_6	The epidemiology, pathogenesis, transmission, diagnosis, and management of multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant, and incurable tuberculosis	Global tuberculosis incidence has declined marginally over the past decade, and tuberculosis remains out of control in several parts of the world including Africa and Asia. Although tuberculosis control has been effective in some regions of the world, these gains are threatened by the increasing burden of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis. XDR tuberculosis has evolved in several tuberculosis-endemic countries to drug-incurable or programmatically incurable tuberculosis (totally drug-resistant tuberculosis). This poses several challenges similar to those encountered in the pre-chemotherapy era, including the inability to cure tuberculosis, high mortality, and the need for alternative methods to prevent disease transmission. This phenomenon mirrors the worldwide increase in antimicrobial resistance and the emergence of other MDR pathogens, such as malaria, HIV, and Gram-negative bacteria. MDR and XDR tuberculosis are associated with high morbidity and substantial mortality, are a threat to health-care workers, prohibitively expensive to treat, and are therefore a serious public health problem. In this Commission, we examine several aspects of drug-resistant tuberculosis. The traditional view that acquired resistance to antituberculous drugs is driven by poor compliance and programmatic failure is now being questioned, and several lines of evidence suggest that alternative mechanisms-including pharmacokinetic variability, induction of efflux pumps that transport the drug out of cells, and suboptimal drug penetration into tuberculosis lesions-are likely crucial to the pathogenesis of drug- resistant tuberculosis. These factors have implications for the design of new interventions, drug delivery and dosing mechanisms, and public health policy. We discuss epidemiology and transmission dynamics, including new insights into the fundamental biology of transmission, and we review the utility of newer diagnostic tools, including molecular tests and next-generation whole-genome sequencing, and their potential for clinical effectiveness. Relevant research priorities are highlighted, including optimal medical and surgical management, the role of newer and repurposed drugs (including bedaquiline, delamanid, and linezolid), pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations, preventive strategies (such as prophylaxis in MDR and XDR contacts), palliative and patient-orientated care aspects, and medicolegal and ethical issues.

10.4103_IJPM.IJPM_53_16	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis detection and characterization of mutations in mycobacterium tuberculosis by genotype MTBDRplus	Detection of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis by conventional phenotypic drug susceptibility testing methods requires several weeks. Therefore, molecular diagnostic tests for rapid detection of multidrug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are urgently needed. Early diagnosis helps in initiating optimal treatment which would not only enable cure of an individual patient but also will curb the transmission of drug resistance in the community. Line probe assay (LPA) has shown great promises in the diagnosis of MDR-TB. All MDR suspect patients from ten-linked districts were asked to deposit sputum samples at peripheral designated microscopy centers. The district TB officers facilitated the transport of samples collected during February 2014-December 2014 to our laboratory. The detection of rpoB gene mutations for rifampicin (RIF) and katG and inhA genes for isoniazid (INH), respectively, was performed on 663 samples by LPA. A total of 663 sputum samples from MDR suspects were received of which 321 (50.8%) were found to be MDR. Missing of WT8 along with mutation in codon S531 L was the most common pattern for RIF-resistant isolates (80.8%) and missing WT along with mutation in codon S315T1 of katG gene was the most common pattern for INH-resistant isolates (91.3%). The MDR-TB in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, India, was found to be 50.8%. The common mutations obtained for RIF and INH in the region was mostly similar to those reported earlier.

10.3346_jkms.2017.32.4.636	Additional Drug Resistance Patterns among Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients in Korea: Implications for Regimen Design	Detailed information on additional drug resistance patterns of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is essential to build an effective treatment regimen; however, such data are scarce in Korea. We retrospectively analyzed the results of phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) of culture confirmed-TB patients from January 2010 to December 2014 in 7 university hospitals in Korea. MDR-TB was identified among 6.8% (n = 378) of 5,599 isolates. A total of 57.1% (n = 216) of the MDR-TB patients had never been treated for TB. Strains from MDR-TB patients showed additional resistance to pyrazinamide (PZA) (35.7%), any second-line injectable drug (19.3%), and any fluoroquinolone (26.2%). Extensively drug resistant TB comprised 12.4% (n = 47) of the MDR-TB patients. Of 378 MDR-TB patients, 50.3% (n = 190) were eligible for the shorter MDR-TB regimen, and 50.0% (n = 189) were fully susceptible to the 5 drugs comprising the standard conventional regimen (PZA, kanamycin, ofloxoacin, prothionamide, and cycloserine). In conclusion, the proportion of new patients and the levels of additional drug resistance were high in MDR-TB patients. Considering the high levels of drug resistance, the shorter MDR-TB treatment regimen may not be feasible; instead, an individually tailored regimen based on the results of molecular and phenotypic DST may be more appropriate in MDR-TB patients in Korea.

10.1093_jac_dkw522	Estimated generic prices for novel treatments for drug-resistant tuberculosis	Background: The estimated worldwide annual incidence of MDR-TB is 480 000, representing 5% of TB incidence, but 20% of mortality. Multiple drugs have recently been developed or repurposed for the treatment of MDR-TB. Currently, treatment for MDR-TB costs thousands of dollars per course. Objectives: To estimate generic prices for novel TB drugs that would be achievable given large-scale competitive manufacture. Methods: Prices for linezolid, moxifloxacin and clofazimine were estimated based on per-kilogram prices of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Other costs were added, including formulation, packaging and a profit margin. The projected costs for sutezolid were estimated to be equivalent to those for linezolid, based on chemical similarity. Generic prices for bedaquiline, delamanid and pretomanid were estimated by assessing routes of synthesis, costs/kg of chemical reagents, routes of synthesis and per-step yields. Costing algorithms reflected variable regulatory requirements and efficiency of scale based on demand, and were validated by testing predictive ability against widely available TB medicines. Results: Estimated generic prices were US$8-$17/month for bedaquiline, $5-$16/month for delamanid, $11-$34/month for pretomanid, $4-$9/month for linezolid, $4-$9/month for sutezolid, $4-$11/month for clofazimine and $4-$8/month for moxifloxacin. The estimated generic prices were 87%-94% lower than the current lowest available prices for bedaquiline, 95%-98% for delamanid and 94%-97% for linezolid. Estimated generic prices were $168-$395 per course for the STREAM trial modified Bangladesh regimens (current costs $734-$1799), $53-$276 for pretomanid-based three-drug regimens and $238-$507 for a delamanid-based four-drug regimen. Conclusions: Competitive large-scale generic manufacture could allow supplies of treatment for 5-10 times more MDR-TB cases within current procurement budgets.

10.1099_jmm.0.000449	Rapid detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in extrapulmonary tuberculosis and sputum smear-negative pulmonary suspects using Xpert MTB/RIF	Background. Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious public health problem in developing countries such as Pakistan. Rapid diagnosis of TB and detection of drug resistance are very important for timely and appropriate management of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Objective. The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic efficacy of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for rapid diagnosis of TB and detection of rifampicin (RIF) resistance in extrapulmonary and smear-negative pulmonary TB suspects. Methods. A total of 98 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and 168 extrapulmonary specimens were processed by Xpert MTB/RIF. Culture results are considered as the gold standard for diagnosis of TB, and drug susceptibility testing for detection of RIF resistance. Diagnostic efficacy was measured in terms of sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values. Results. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay detected 40 (40.8 %) of 98 BALF of presumptive pulmonary TB and 60 (35.7 %) of 168 extrapulmonary specimens. Sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for detection of TB was 86 and 88.4 %, respectively. The positive predictive value was 71.5% while negative predictive value was 95.1 %. Conclusion. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a rapid and simple technique with high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing TB and detecting drug resistance in extrapulmonary and smear-negative TB cases.

10.3791_55273	System for Efficacy and Cytotoxicity Screening of Inhibitors Targeting Intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. With the increased spread of multi drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), there is a real urgency to develop new therapeutic strategies against M. tuberculosis infections. Traditionally, compounds are evaluated based on their antibacterial activity under in vitro growth conditions in broth; however, results are often misleading for intracellular pathogens like M. tuberculosis since in-broth phenotypic screening conditions are significantly different from the actual disease conditions within the human body. Screening for inhibitors that work inside macrophages has been traditionally difficult due to the complexity, variability in infection, and slow replication rate of M. tuberculosis. In this study, we report a new approach to rapidly assess the effectiveness of compounds on the viability of M. tuberculosis in a macrophage infection model. Using a combination of a cytotoxicity assay and an in-broth M. tuberculosis viability assay, we were able to create a screening system that generates a comprehensive analysis of compounds of interest. This system is capable of producing quantitative data at a low cost that is within reach of most labs and yet is highly scalable to fit large industrial settings.

10.1128_AAC.01783_16	Pharmacokinetic Modeling and Limited Sampling Strategies Based on Healthy Volunteers for Monitoring of Ertapenem in Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Ertapenem is a broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic whose activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis is being explored. Carbapenems have antibacterial activity when the plasma concentration exceeds the MIC at least 40% of the time (40% T-MIC). To assess the 40% T-MIC in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients, a limited sampling strategy was developed using a population pharmacokinetic model based on data for healthy volunteers. A two-compartment population pharmacokinetic model was developed with data for 42 healthy volunteers using an iterative two-stage Bayesian method. External validation was performed by Bayesian fitting of the model developed with data for volunteers to the data for individual MDR-TB patients (in which the fitted values of the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h [ AUC(0-24), fit values] were used) using the population model developed for volunteers as a prior. A Monte Carlo simulation (n = 1,000) was used to evaluate limited sampling strategies. Additionally, the 40% T-MIC with the free fraction (f 40% T-MIC) of ertapenem in MDR-TB patients was estimated with the population pharmacokinetic model. The population pharmacokinetic model that was developed was shown to overestimate the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC(0 -24)) in MDR-TB patients by 6.8% (range, -17.2 to 30.7%). The best-performing limited sampling strategy, which had a time restriction of 0 to 6 h, was found to be sampling at 1 and 5 h (r(2) = 0.78, mean prediction error = - 0.33%, root mean square error = 5.5%). Drug exposure was overestimated by a mean percentage of 4.2% (range, -15.2 to 23.6%). When a free fraction of 5% was considered and the MIC was set at 0.5 mg/liter, the minimum f 40% T-MIC would have been exceeded in 9 out of 12 patients. A population pharmacokinetic model and limited sampling strategy, developed using data from healthy volunteers, were shown to be adequate to predict ertapenem exposure in MDR-TB patients.	ertapenem; tuberculosis; pharmacokinetics; pharmacokinetic model; limited sampling; multidrug resistance	CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; CARBAPENEMS; HEMODIALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; DIALYSIS; OBESE
10.5588_ijtld.16.0694	Tuberculosis drug resistance in Southern Mozambique: results of a population-level survey in the district of Manhica	SETTING: Mozambique, one of the world's high tuberculosis (TB) burden countries, has conducted only one national-level drug resistance survey, in 2007-2008. OBJECTIVE: To determine the drug resistance patterns of laboratory-confirmed TB cases. DESIGN: This was a population-level survey conducted over a 1-year period in the district of Manhica. All laboratory-confirmed cases were evaluated for first-line anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing using liquid culture. RESULTS: Resistance to at least one first-line drug was observed in 44 of 276 isolates (15.9%). Prevalence of drug resistance to each of the five anti-tuberculosis drugs tested was 4.0% for streptomycin, 10.1% for isoniazid (INH), 6.2% for rifampicin, 3.6% for ethambutol and1.1% for pyrazinamide. The overall prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was 5.1%: 3.8% (95%CI 2.0-7.0) in new and 13.2% (95%CI 5.8-27.3) in retreatment cases. Respectively 4.6% and 2.6% of new and retreatment cases were INH-monoresistant. Previous history of anti-tuberculosis treatment was associated with having MDR-TB (OR 4.3, 95%CI 1.3-14.1). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of drug resistance in the district of Manhica is slightly higher than, but still compatible with, previous national estimates. INH monoresistance was high, posing the risk of hidden monotherapy in the continuation phase.

10.1016_j.biopha.2017.01.098	A novel benzothiazinethione analogue SKLB-TB1001 displays potent antimycobacterial activities in a series of murine models	New chemotherapeutic compounds and regimens are needed to combat multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Here, we used a series of murine models to assess an antitubercular lead compound SKLB-TB1001. In the Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin and the acute M. tuberculosis H37Rv infection mouse models, SKLB-TB1001 significantly attenuated the mycobacterial load in lungs and spleens. The colony forming unit counts and histological examination of lungs from H37Rv infected mice revealed that the benzothiazinethione analogue SKLB-TB1001 as a higher dose level was as effective as isoniazid. Moreover, in a multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB mouse model, SKLB-TB1001 showed significant activity in a dose-dependent manner and was more effective than streptomycin. These results suggested that SKLB-TB1001 could be an antitubercular drug candidate worth further investigation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

10.1016_j.meegid.2017.01.002	RNA expression analysis of efflux pump genes in clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in South Korea	Tuberculosis (TB), caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is an important communicable disease. Various mechanisms of resistance to antituberculosis drugs have been reported; these are principally mutations in target genes. However, not all M. tuberculosis resistance can be explained by mutations in such genes. Other resistance mechanisms associated with drug transport, such as efflux pumps, have also been reported. In this study, we investigated the expression levels of three putative efflux pumps and mutations in target genes associatedwith injectable agents and fluoroquinoloneswith clinicalMDR and XDR-TB isolates. Thirty clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis that had been phenotypically characterized were obtained from the Korean Institute of Tuberculosis. Of these, 14 were MDR-TB isolates resistant to at least one injectable aminoglycoside (amikacin; AMK, kanamycin; KAN, and/or capreomycin; CPM) and 16 were XDR-TB isolates. M. tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC 27249) was used as a reference strain. Five putative genes (Rv1258c, Rv2686c, Rv2687c, Rv2688c and pstB) were selected for analysis in this study. Sequencing was performed to detect mutations in rrs and eis genes. qRT-PCR was performed to investigate expression levels of five efflux pump genes. Of the 30 isolates, 25 strains hadmutations in rrs associated with resistance to KAN, CPMand AMK and two strains had eis mutations, as well as mutations in rrs. pstB (Rv0933) exhibited increased expression and Rv2687c and Rv2688c exhibited decreased expression compared to the reference strain. Increased expression of pstB in clinical drug-resistant tuberculosis isolates may contribute to drug resistance in M. tuberculosis. In our case, overexpression of Rv1258c may have been associated with resistance to kanamycin. No correlation was evident between Rv2686c, Rv2687c or Rv2688c expression and fluoroquinolone resistance. To explore the details of efflux pump drug-resistancemechanisms, further studies on efflux pump inhibitors, transcriptional regulators, such as whiB7, and additional efflux pump genes are needed.

10.1371_journal.pone.0173804	Comparative accuracy of the REBA MTB MDR and Hain MTBDRplus line probe assays for the detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: A multicenter, non-inferiority study	Introduction Despite recent diagnostic advances, the majority of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases remain undiagnosed. Line probes assays (LiPAs) hold great promise to curb the spread of MDR-TB as they can rapidly detect MDR-TB even when laboratory infrastructure is limited, yet few of these assays are currently widely available or supported by World Health Organization (WHO) policy. Methods The aim of this prospective, blinded, non-inferiority study was to compare the performance of YD Diagnostics REBA MTB MDR LiPA (YD) to the WHO-endorsed Hain MTBDRplus V1 LiPA (Hain V1) for the detection of rifampicin and isoniazid resistance. In phase 1, YD and Hain V1 diagnostic performance was assessed with selected culture isolates and results were compared to phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) results and targeted sequencing data. In phase 2, both assays were tested on processed sputum samples and results were compared to phenotypic DST results. Results In phase 1, YD did not achieve non-inferiority to Hain V1. For isoniazid resistance detection, Hain V1 had a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 83.8-93%) and specificity of 99.4% (95% CI 96.9-100%). While YD had a similar sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 87.3-95.4%), the specificity was inferior at 92.6% (95% CI 87.6-96%). For rifampicin resistance detection, Hain V1 had a sensitivity of 90.2% (95% CI 84.8-94.2%) and specificity of 98.5% (95% CI 95.7-99.7%) while YD had an inferior sensitivity of 72.4% (95% CI 65.1-78.9%) and a comparable specificity of 98% (95% CI 95-99.5%). Similar results were observed in phase 2. For MDR-TBdetection, the sensitivity and specificity of Hain V1 was 93.4% (95% CI 88.2-96.2%) and 96.2% (95% CI 88.2-96.8%), respectively, compared to 75.7% (95% CI 68-82.2%) and 92% (95% CI 88.2-94.9%) for YD. Conclusions YD did not achieve non-inferiority with Hain V1. Further improvements and repeat evaluation of YD is necessary prior to recommending its use for clinical settings.

10.1186_s12879_017_2323_y	Multidrug resistant tuberculosis in Ethiopian settings and its association with previous history of anti-tuberculosis treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis	Background: Efforts to control the global burden of tuberculosis (TB) have been jeopardized by the rapid evolution of multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), which is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. Previous studies have documented variable prevalences of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and its risk factors in Ethiopia. Therefore, this meta-analysis is aimed, firstly, to determine the pooled prevalence of MDR-TB among newly diagnosed and previously treated TB cases, and secondly, to measure the association between MDR-TB and a history of previous anti-TB drugs treatment. Methods: PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar databases were searched. Studies that reported a prevalence of MDR-TB among new and previously treated TB patients were selected. Studies or surveys conducted at national or sub-national level, with reported MDR-TB prevalence or sufficient data to calculate prevalence were considered for the analysis. Two authors searched and reviewed the studies for eligibility and extracted the data in pre-defined forms. Forest plots of all prevalence estimates were performed and summary estimates were also calculated using random effects models. Associations between previous TB treatment and MDR-MTB infection were examined through subgroup analyses stratified by new and previously treated patients. Results: We identified 16 suitable studies and found an overall prevalence of MDR-TB among newly diagnosed and previously treated TB patients to be 2% (95% CI 1% - 2%) and 15% (95% CI 12% - 17%), respectively. The observed difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001) and there was an odds ratio of 8.1 (95% CI 7.5-8.7) for previously treated TB patients to develop a MDR-MTB infection compared to newly diagnosed cases. For the past 10 years (2006 to 2014) the overall MDR-TB prevalence showed a stable time trend. Conclusions: The burden of MDR-TB remains high in Ethiopian settings, especially in previously treated TB cases. Previous TB treatment was the most powerful predictor for MDR-MTB infection. Strict compliance with anti-TB regimens and improving case detection rate are the necessary steps to tackle the problem in Ethiopia.

10.1186_s12906_017_1563	Evaluation of the antimycobacterial activity of crude extracts and solvent fractions of selected Ethiopian medicinal plants	Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is a global health problem complicated by drug resistance and human immunodeficiency virus that has dramatically increased active TB. Several medicinal plants are used traditionally to treat TB in Ethiopia and investigating these plants is required as plants are an alternative source for development of new anti-TB drugs. The purpose of this study was to investigate antimycobacterial activity of crude extract of Carissa edulis, Otostegia integrifolia, Persea americana, Pterolobium stellatum and Vernonia amygdalina as well as fractions of the most active crude extract. Methods: The effect of various doses of the crude extracts as well as solvent fractions on M. tuberculosis H37Rv and/or MDR-TB clinical isolate was determined using broth microdilution and microtiter resazurin assay methods. Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined by CFU count and resazurin color change observation. Results: Chloroform and 80% methanol extracts of P. stellatum and O. integrifolia as well as 80% methanol and acetone extracts of P. americana had significant antimycobacterial activity (p < 0.001) against M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Chloroform extract of V. amygdalina and C. edulis didn't, however, show any significant activity compared to negative controls. P. stellatum chloroform extract was the most active on M. tuberculosis H37Rv (MIC 0.039 mg/ml) and AOZ8W-4 (MDR-TB clinical isolate) (MIC = 0.078 mg/ml). Ethyl acetate fraction of P. stellatum chloroform extract was the most active fraction. Conclusion: P. stellatum, O. integrifolia and P. americana were found to be endowed with antimycobacterial activity. However, P. stellatum appears to be the most promising plant based on criteria set by different studies. Ethyl acetate fraction of P. stellatum was found to be the most active and future studies should involve this fraction.

10.1186_s12913_017_2118_2	Cost-effectiveness of adding novel or group 5 interventions to a background regimen for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Germany	Background: Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is complex, lengthy, and involves a minimum of four drugs termed a background regimen (BR), that have not previously been prescribed or that have proven susceptible to patient sputum culture isolates. In recent years, promising new treatment options have emerged as add-on therapies to a BR. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term costs and effectiveness of adding the novel or group 5 interventions bedaquiline, delamanid, and linezolid to a background regimen (BR) of drugs for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), within their marketing authorisations, from a German healthcare cost-effectiveness perspective. Methods: A cohort-based Markov model was developed to simulate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of bedaquiline plus BR, delamanid plus BR, or linezolid plus BR versus BR alone in the treatment of MDR-TB, over a 10-year time horizon. Effectiveness of treatment was evaluated in Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) and LifeYears Gained (LYG), using inputs from clinical trials for bedaquiline and delamanid and from a German observational study for linezolid. Cost data were obtained from German Drug Directory costs (epsilon/2015), published literature, and expert opinion. A 3% yearly discount rate was applied. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: The total discounted costs per-patient were epsilon 85,575 for bedaquiline plus BR, epsilon 81,079 for delamanid plus BR, and epsilon 80,460 for linezolid plus BR, compared with a cost of epsilon 60,962 for BR alone. The total discounted QALYs per-patient were 5.95 for bedaquiline plus BR, 5.36 for delamanid plus BR, and 3.91 for linezolid plus BR, compared with 3.68 for BR alone. All interventions were therefore associated with higher QALYs and higher costs than BR alone, with incremental costs per QALY gained of epsilon 22,238 for bedaquiline, epsilon 38,703 for delamanid, and epsilon 87,484 for linezolid, versus BR alone. In a fully incremental analysis, bedaquiline plus BR was the most cost-effective treatment option at thresholds greater than epsilon 22,000 per QALY gained. In probabilistic analyses, the probability that bedaquiline plus BR was the most cost-effective treatment strategy at a willingness-to-pay threshold of epsilon 30,000 was 54.5%, compared with 22.9% for BR alone, 18.2% for delamanid plus BR, and 4.4% for linezolid. Conclusions: In Germany, the addition of bedaquiline, delamanid, or linezolid to a BR would result in QALY gains over BR alone. Based on this analysis, bedaquiline is likely to be the most cost-effective intervention for the treatment of MDRTB, when added to a BR regimen at thresholds greater than epsilon 22,000 per QALY.

10.1371_journal.pone.0172748	MDR-TB treatment as prevention: The projected population-level impact of expanded treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Background In 2013, approximately 480,000 people developed active multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), while only 97,000 started MDR-TB treatment. We sought to estimate the impact of improving access to MDR-TB diagnosis and treatment, under multiple diagnostic algorithm and treatment regimen scenarios, on ten-year projections of MDR-TB incidence and mortality. Methods We constructed a dynamic transmission model of an MDR-TB epidemic in an illustrative East/Southeast Asian setting. Using approximate Bayesian computation, we investigated a wide array of potential epidemic trajectories consistent with current notification data and known TB epidemiology. Results Despite an overall projected decline in TB incidence, data-consistent simulations suggested that MDR-TB incidence is likely to rise between 2015 and 2025 under continued 2013 treatment practices, although with considerable uncertainty (median 17% increase, 95% Uncertainty Range [UR] -38% to + 137%). But if, by 2017, all identified active TB patients with previously-treated TB could be tested for drug susceptibility, and 85% of those with MDR-TB could initiate MDR-appropriate treatment, then MDR-TB incidence in 2025 could be reduced by 26% (95% UR 4-52%) relative to projections under continued current practice. Also expanding this drug-susceptibility testing and appropriate MDR-TB treatment to treatment-naive as well as previously-treated TB cases, by 2020, could reduce MDR-TB incidence in 2025 by 29% (95% UR 6-55%) compared to continued current practice. If this diagnosis and treatment of all MDR-TB in known active TB cases by 2020 could be implemented via a novel second-line regimen with similar effectiveness and tolerability as current first-line therapy, a 54% (95% UR 20-74%) reduction in MDR-TB incidence compared to current-practice projections could be achieved by 2025. Conclusions Expansion of diagnosis and treatment of MDR-TB, even using current sub-optimal second-line regimens, is expected to significantly decrease MDR-TB incidence at the population level. Focusing MDR diagnostic efforts on previously-treated cases is an efficient first-step approach.

10.1016_j.bjid.2016.11.006	Clinical and epidemiological characteristics associated with unfavorable tuberculosis treatment outcomes in TB-HIV co-infected patients in Brazil: a hierarchical polytomous analysis	Background: TB patients co-infected with HIV have worse treatment outcomes than noncoinfected patients. How clinical characteristics of TB and socioeconomic characteristics influence these outcomes is poorly understood. Here, we use polytomous regression analysis to identify clinical and epidemiological characteristics associated with unfavorable treatment outcomes among TB-HIV co-infected patients in Brazil. Methods: TB-HIV cases reported in the Brazilian information system (SINAN) between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2011 were identified and categorized by TB treatment outcome (cure, default, death, and development of MDR TB). We modeled treatment outcome as a function of clinical characteristics of TB and patient socioeconomic characteristics by polytomous regression analysis. For each treatment outcome, we used cure as the reference outcome. Results: Between 2001 and 2011, 990,017 cases of TB were reported in SINAN, of which 93,147 (9.4%) were HIV co-infected. Patients aged 15-19 (OR= 2.86; 95% CI: 2.09-3.91) and 20-39 years old (OR= 2.30; 95% CI: 1.81-2.92) were more likely to default on TB treatment than those aged 0-14 years old. In contrast, patients aged >= 60 years were more likely to die from TB (OR = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.43-3.44) or other causes (OR= 2.86; 95% CI: 2.14-3.83). Black patients were more likely to default on TB treatment (OR= 1.33; 95% CI: 1.22-1.44) and die from TB (OR= 1.50; 95% CI: 1.29-1.74). Finally, alcoholism was associated with all unfavorable outcomes: default (OR= 1.94; 95% CI: 1.73-2.17), death due to TB (OR= 1.46; 95% CI: 1.25-1.71), death due to other causes (OR= 1.38; 95% CI: 1.21-1.57) and MDR-TB (OR = 2.29; 95% CI: 1.46-3.58). Conclusions: Socio-economic vulnerability has a significant effect on treatment outcomes among TB-HIV co-infected patients in Brazil. Enhancing social support, incorporation of alcohol abuse screening and counseling into current TB surveillance programs and targeting interventions to specific age groups are interventions that could improve treatment outcomes.

10.1183_13993003.01799_2016	Long-term outcome and safety of prolonged bedaquiline treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Bedaquiline, a recently approved drug for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), is recommended for a duration of 24 weeks. There are scarce data on patients treated with this drug outside clinical trials. All MDR-TB patients who started treatment from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2013 and received. >= 30 days of bedaquiline were included in a multicentre observational cohort. Among 45 MDR-TB patients, 53% harboured isolates resistant to both fluoroquinolones and secondline injectables, and 38% harboured isolates resistant to one of these drug classes. Median bedaquiline treatment duration was 361 days and 33 patients (73%) received prolonged (> 190 days) bedaquiline treatment. Overall, 36 patients (80%) had favourable outcome, five were lost to follow-up, three died, and one failed and acquired bedaquiline resistance. No cases of recurrence were reported. Severe and serious adverse events were recorded in 60% and 18% of patients, respectively. Values of Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF) > 500 ms were recorded in 11% of patients, but neither arrhythmias nor symptomatic cardiac side-effects occurred. Bedaquiline was discontinued in three patients following QTcF prolongation. No significant differences in outcomes or adverse events rates were observed between patients receiving standard and prolonged bedaquiline treatment. Bedaquiline-containing regimens achieved favourable outcomes in a large proportion of patients. Prolonged bedaquiline treatment was overall well tolerated in this cohort.

10.1016_j.ijantimicag.2016.11.027	Activity of moxifloxacin and linezolid against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in combination with potentiator drugs verapamil, timcodar, colistin and SQ109	Current treatment for tuberculosis (TB) is complicated by the emergence of multidrug resistant TB (MDRTB). As a result, there is an urgent need for new powerful anti-TB regimens and novel strategies. In this study, we aimed to potentiate amoxifloxacin + linezolid backbone as treatment for MDR-TB with the efflux pump inhibitors verapamil and timcodar as well as with drugs that act on mycobacterial cell wall stability such as colistin and SQ109. Using a time-kill kinetics assay, the activities of moxifloxacin, linezolid, verapamil, timcodar, colistin and SQ109 as single drugs against Mycobacterium tuberculosis were evaluated. In addition, the activity of the moxifloxacin + linezolid backbone in combination with one of the potentiator drugs was assessed. As little as 0.125 mg/L moxifloxacin achieved 99% killing of M. tuberculosis after 6 days of exposure. Linezolid showedmoderate killing but 99% killingwas not achieved. Verapamil, timcodar and colistin only resulted in killing with the highest concentrations tested but 99% killing was not achieved. SQ109 resulted in complete elimination after 1 day of exposure to 256 mg/L and in 99% elimination after 6 days of exposure to 1mg/L. Furthermore, colistin added to the moxifloxacin + linezolid backbone resulted in increased elimination, whereas verapamil, timcodar and SQ109 showed no added value to the backbone. This finding that colistin potentiates the activity of the moxifloxacin + linezolid backbone against M. tuberculosis suggests its potential role in further studies on the applicability of a moxifloxacin + linezolid treatment of MDR-TB.

10.1016_j.ijid.2016.10.026	Classifying new anti-tuberculosis drugs: rationale and future perspectives	The classification of anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs is important as it helps the clinician to build an appropriate anti-TB regimen for multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB cases that do not fulfil the criteria for the shorter MDR-TB regimen. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently approved a revision of the classification of new anti-TB drugs based on current evidence on each drug. In the previous WHO guidelines, the choice of drugs was based on efficacy and toxicity in a step-down manner, from group 1 first-line drugs and groups 2-5 second-line drugs, to group 5 drugs with potentially limited efficacy or limited clinical evidence. In the revised WHO classification, exclusively aimed at managing drug-resistant cases, medicines are again listed in hierarchical order from group A to group D. In parallel, a possible future classification is independently proposed. The aim of this viewpoint article is to describe the evolution in WHO TB classification (taking into account an independently proposed new classification) and recent changes inWHOguidance, while commenting on the differences between them. The latest evidence on the ex-group 5 drugs is also discussed. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

10.1038_ng.3767	Genomic analysis of globally diverse Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains provides insights into the emergence and spread of multidrug resistance	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), caused by drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is an increasingly serious problem worldwide. Here we examined a data set of whole-genome sequences from 5,310 M. tuberculosis isolates from five continents. Despite the great diversity of these isolates with respect to geographical point of isolation, genetic background and drug resistance, the patterns for the emergence of drug resistance were conserved globally. We have identified harbinger mutations that often precede multidrug resistance. In particular, the katG mutation encoding p.Ser315Thr, which confers resistance to isoniazid, overwhelmingly arose before mutations that conferred rifampicin resistance across all of the lineages, geographical regions and time periods. Therefore, molecular diagnostics that include markers for rifampicin resistance alone will be insufficient to identify pre-MDR strains. Incorporating knowledge of polymorphisms that occur before the emergence of multidrug resistance, particularly katG p.Ser315Thr, into molecular diagnostics should enable targeted treatment of patients with pre-MDR-TB to prevent further development of MDR-TB.

10.1016_j.tube.2017.01.006	The effect size of type 2 diabetes mellitus on tuberculosis drug resistance and adverse treatment outcomes	Objective: To evaluate the effect size of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcomes and multi drug resistance (MDR). Methods: A cohort with 507 individuals with diagnosed TB included 183 with coexistence of T2DM and TB (TB-T2DM). Participants were identified at the time of TB diagnosis and followed during the course of TB treatment. Then we computed relative risks and adjustments by Cox proportional hazards for outcome variables (drug resistance, death, relapse, treatment failure), and the size of their effect as Cohen's-d. Results: Patients with TB-T2DM were more likely to remain positive for acid-fast bacilli after two months of anti-TB treatment RR = [2.01 (95% CI: 1.3, 3.1)], to have drug resistant (DR) [OR 3.5 (95% CI: 1.8, 6.7)] and multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB [OR 3.5 (95% CI: 1.8, 7.1)]. The Cohen's-d for DR or MDR in T2DM was 0.69 when compared with non-DM subjects. The T2DM patients had higher odds of resistance to isoniazid (OR 3.9, 95% CI: 2.01, 7.9), rifampicin (OR 3.4, 95% CI: 1.6, 7.2) and pyrazinamide (OR 9.4, 95% CI: 2.8, 25.6), and their effect sizes were >= 0.67. Patients with TB T2DM (versus no DM) were more likely to present with MDR TB (HR 3.1; 95% CI: 1.7, 5.8; p < 0.001), treatment failure (HR 2.04; 95% CI: 1.07, 3.8; p = 0.02) and relapse (HR 1.86; 95% CI: 1.09, 3.1; p = 0.02), with effect size >= 0.34. Conclusion: T2DM showed a substantial contribution to the presence of DR or MDR-TB and to adverse clinical outcomes during and after TB treatment. Our findings support the importance for routine screening of T2DM among newly-diagnosed TB patients in order to stratify them for immediate DR assessment, and highlight the need for clinical trials to evaluate variations to the standard TB treatment in TB-T2DM to prevent adverse treatment outcomes.

10.1016_j.jinf.2016.12.005	Drug resistant TB: UK multicentre study (DRUMS): Treatment, management and outcomes in London and West Midlands 2008-2014	"Objectives: Detailed information regarding treatment practices and outcomes of MDR-TB treatment in the UK is required as a baseline for care improvements. Methods: 100 consecutive cases between 2008 and 2014 were reviewed retrospectively at 4 MDR-TB treatment centres in England to obtain information on drug treatment choices, hospital admission duration and outcomes for MDR-TB. Results: Initial hospital admission was long, median 62.5 (IQR 20-106, n = 92) days, and 13% (12/92) of patients lost their home during this period. Prolonged admission was associated with pulmonary cases, cavities on chest radiograph, a public health policy of waiting for sputum culture conversion (CC) and loss of the patient's home. Sputum CC occurred at a median of 33.5 (IQR 16-55, n = 46) days. Treatment success was high (74%, 74/100) and mortality low (1%, 1/100). A significant proportion of the cohort had ""neutral"" results due to deportation and transfer overseas (12%, (12/100)). 14% (14/100) had negative outcomes for which poor adherence was the main reason (62%, 9/14). Conclusions: Successful outcome is common in recognised centres and limited by adherence rather than microbiological failure. Duration of hospital admission is influenced by lack of suitable housing and some variation in public health practice. Wider access to long-term assisted living facilities could improve completion rates. (C) 2016 The British Infection Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

10.1016_j.ejogrb.2016.12.009	Multi drug resistant female genital tuberculosis: A preliminary report	Objective: Evaluation of 6 patients presenting with tubo-ovarian mass or infertility with multi drug resistant (MDR) female genital tuberculosis (FGTB). Study design: It was an observational study in a tertiary referral centre, India on subjects with MDR FGTB on clinical examination and investigations. All patients were given category IV drugs using kanamycin (intramuscular), levofloxacin, pyrazinamide, cycloserine, ethionamide and ethambutol (or para aminosalicylic acid [PAS] for ethambutol resistant cases) for 6 months intensive phase followed by oral levofioxacin, cycloserine, ethionamide and ethambutol (or PAS for ethambutol resistant cases) for 18 months continuation phase. Patients were evaluated for primary end points (complete cure, partial response, no response, treatment completed) and secondary end points (recurrence rate, pregnancy rate) during treatment. Results: There were 2 (33.3%) primary MDR FGTB patients and 4 (66.6%) secondary MDR FGTB (three pulmonary MDR and one MDR lymphadenitis) patients. Mean age was 23.6 years. Presenting features were menstrual dysfunction in all patients (100%) especially oligomenorrhea in 3 (50%) patients, weight loss in all the patients (100%), cough with expectoration in three patients (50%), tubo-ovarian masses in five (833%) patients. Endometrial biopsy showed positive culture for AFB with rifampicin and isoniazid (INH) resistance in both primary MDR FGTB patients and in two secondary MDR FGTB patients who were sexually active. In secondary MDR FGTB, three pulmonary MDR patients had positive sputum AFB smear and culture, while the patient with MDR lymphadenitis had lymph node aspirate for AFB smear and culture positive with all showing resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid. Gene Xpert on endometrial biopsy or sputum was positive in 5 (83.3%) patients. Three (50%) patients (one primary and two secondary) have completed therapy while other 3 (50%) are in continuation phase. All patients are asymptomatic with one having 12 weeks ongoing successful pregnancy. Conclusion: MDR FGTB should be thought of in women of FGTB with tubo- ovarian masses who are not responding to first line drugs. Gene Xpert can be used in early diagnosis of MDR FGTB.

While there is no doubt that revolutionary diagnostics and new and repurposed drugs have provided some hope in the fight against TB, it is evident that scientific advances on their own are inadequate to achieve the World Health Organization's ambitious goal to end TB by 2035. In this article, the consequences of a myopic and conventional biomedical approach to TB, which has ultimately permeated to the level of individual patient care, are highlighted.

10.1016_j.ijid.2016.11.416	Shifting from tuberculosis control to elimination: Where are we ? What are the variables and limitations ? Is it achievable?	Tuberculosis (TB) is a priority in terms of incidence and mortality, with about 10.4 million new incident cases and 1.8 million deaths in 2015. The End-TB strategy recently launched by the World Health Organization in the context of the post-2015 agenda, aimed to achieve TB elimination, represents an evolution of the previous historical strategies originally aimed to achieve TB control. Globally, the current decline in TB incidence is rather slow at approximately 1,5% per year to reach the TB preelimination phase by 2035 (A more aggressive approach based on diagnosis and treatment of latently infected individuals has been proposed in the context of TB elimination to ensure future generations free of TB. We describes 4 scenarios which, combined, describe the TB epidemiology in a given setting: 1) in absence of interventions, 2) with early TB diagnosis and effective treatment, 3) with irregular TB treatment, 4) with TB co-infected by HIV not undergoing anti-retroviral treatment. To achieve TB Elimination, a more concerted action by funders and governments will be required for further investments into TB prevention, detection and treatment. (C) 2016 The Authors.

10.1016_j.ijid.2016.11.002	European policies in the management of tuberculosis among migrants	Globally 10.4 million new tuberculosis (TB) incident cases were estimated to have occurred in 2015, of which 3% were reported in the World Health Organization European Region. Importantly, about 25% of the global multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases are reported in the European Region, representing one of the greatest challenges to TB control; these are reported particularly in the countries of the Former Soviet Union. Over a quarter of TB cases in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) are reported among foreign-born individuals. In line with the recent increase of migration flows towards Europe, TB among migrant populations is also on the rise, emphasizing the need for a better understanding of the TB trends at the regional and sub-regional levels, and of the existing policies on migrants and refugees. The present article is aimed at describing the policies and practices of European countries with a low and intermediate TB incidence with regard to the detection and management of TB and latent TB infection (LTBI) among refugees in Europe.

10.1016_j.ijid.2016.10.021	Applicability of the shorter 'Bangladesh regimen' in high multidrug- resistant tuberculosis settings	In spite of the recent introduction of two new drugs (delamanid and bedaquiline) and a few repurposed compounds to treat multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-and XDRTB), clinicians are facing increasing problems in designing effective regimens in severe cases. Recently a 9 to 12-month regimen (known as the ` Bangladesh regimen') proved to be effective in treating MDR-TB cases. It included an initial phase of 4 to 6 months of kanamycin, moxifloxacin, prothionamide, clofazimine, pyrazinamide, high-dose isoniazid, and ethambutol, followed by 5months of moxifloxacin, clofazimine, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. However, recent evidence from Europe and Latin America identified prevalences of resistance to the first-line drugs in this regimen (ethambutol and pyrazinamide) exceeding 60%, and of prothionamide exceeding 50%. Furthermore, the proportions of resistance to the two most important pillars of the regimen-quinolones and kanamycin-were higher than 40%. Overall, only 14 out of 348 adult patients (4.0%) were susceptible to all of the drugs composing the regimen, and were therefore potentially suitable for the ` shorter regimen'. A shorter, cheaper, and well-tolerated MDR-TB regimen is likely to impact the number of patients treated and improve adherence if prescribed to the right patients through the systematic use of rapid MTBDRsl testing.

10.1093_jac_dkw502	Unexpected high prevalence of resistance-associated Rv0678 variants in MDR-TB patients without documented prior use of clofazimine or bedaquiline	Objectives: Resistance-associated variants (RAVs) in Rv0678, a regulator of the MmpS5-MmpL5 efflux pump, have been shown to lead to increased MICs of bedaquiline ( 2-to8-fold) and clofazimine (2- to 4-fold). The prevalence of these Rv0678 RAVs in clinical isolates and their impact on treatment outcomes are important factors to take into account in bedaquiline treatment guidelines. Methods: Baseline isolates from two bedaquiline MDR-TB clinical trials were sequenced for Rv0678 RAVs and corresponding bedaquiline MICs were determined on 7H11 agar. Rv0678 RAVs were also investigated in non-MDRTB sequences of a population-based cohort. Results: Rv0678 RAVs were identified in 23/347 (6.3%) of MDR-TB baseline isolates. Surprisingly, bedaquiline MICs for these isolates were high (> 0.24 mg/ L, n = 8), normal (0.03-0.24 mg/ L, n =11) or low(< 0.03 mg/ L, n = 4). A variant at position - 11 in the intergenic regionmmpS5- Rv0678 was identified in 39 isolates (11.3%) and appeared to increase the susceptibility to bedaquiline. In non-MDR-TB isolates, the frequency of Rv0678 RAVs was lower (6/852 or 0.7%). Competition experiments suggested that rifampicin was not the drug selecting for Rv0678 RAVs. Conclusions: RAVs in Rv0678 occurmore frequently in MDR-TB patients than previously anticipated, are not associated with prior use of bedaquiline or clofazimine, and in themajority of cases do not lead to bedaquiline MICs above the provisional breakpoint (0.24mg/L). Their origin remains unknown. Given the variety of RAVs in Rv0678 and their variable effects on the MIC, only phenotypic drug-susceptibilitymethods can currently be used to assess bedaquiline susceptibility.

10.21037_jtd.2017.02.54	Clinical outcomes for multi- and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis patients with adjunctive resectional lung surgery in Beijing, China	The objective of this study was to assess the performance of adjective resectional lung surgery for multidrug resistant (MDR-) and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) patients in Beijing, China. Between October 1992 and October 2012, 21 MDR/XDR patients undergoing pulmonary resection at Beijing Chest Hospital were enrolled in this study. The clinical outcomes of MDR-and XDR-TB patients were analyzed with a 3-year surgical follow-up. Out of 21 patients enrolled in this study, 20 patients (95.2%) had unilateral cavitary disease, and 1 patient (4.8%) exhibited bilateral cavitary disease. The most frequent cavitation was located in the left upper lung (38.1%, 8/21). In addition, 19 (90.5%) underwent lobectomy, and the other two (9.5%) underwent pneumonectomy due to obvious cavitation in both upper and lower fields of unilateral lung. After 3-year follow-up, eight patients (38.1%) were cured and 13 patients (61.9%) suffered from unfavorable outcomes. Of 13 patients with unfavorable outcomes, 5 patients (38.5%) died of further progression of TB disease, and 8 patients (61.5%) relapsed. Only 1 (14.3%) out of 7 XDR-TB patients was cured, compared with 7 (50.0%) out of 14 multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that if available, surgical treatment should be considered in MDR/XDRTB patients in China. The subsequent treatment with second-line drugs may play the most important role in determining the final clinical outcome for MDR/XDR-TB patients.

10.1089_mdr.2016.0075	Laboratory-Based Surveillance of Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Eastern China	With 25% of the global burden, China has the highest incidence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in the world. However, surveillance data on extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) from China are scant. To estimate the prevalence of XDR-TB in Zhejiang, Eastern China, 30 of 90 TB treatment centers in Zhejiang were recruited. Patients with suspected TB who reported to the clinics for diagnosis were requested to undergo a smear sputum test. Positive sputum samples were tested for drug susceptibility. Data on anti-TB drug resistance from 1999 to 2008 were also collected to assess drug resistance trends. A total of 931 cases were recruited for drug susceptibility testing (DST). Among these, 23.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.8-24.4) were resistant to any of the following drugs: isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, and ethambutol. Multidrug resistant (MDR) strains were identified in 5.1% of all cases (95% CI, 3.61-6.49). Among MDR-TB cases, 6.4% were XDR (95% CI, 1.7-18.6) and 8.9% (95% CI, 7.0-10.8) of all cases were resistant to either isoniazid or rifampin (but not both). Among MDR-TB cases, 23.4% (95% CI, 12.8-38.4) were resistant to either fluoroquinolones or a second-line anti-TB injectable drug, but not both. From 1999 to 2014, the percentage of MDR cases decreased significantly, from 8.6% to 5.1% (p=0.00). The Global Fund to Fight TB program showed signs of success in Eastern China. However, drug-resistant TB, MDR-TB, and XDR-TB still pose a challenge for TB control in Eastern China. High-quality directly observed treatment, short-course, and universal DST for TB cases to determine appropriate treatment regimens are urgently needed to prevent acquired drug resistance.	tuberculosis; drug susceptibility test; extensively drug resistant tuberculosis; multi-drug resistant tuberculosis	RISK-FACTORS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PREVALENCE; SHANGHAI; TRENDS
10.1016_j.yrtph.2016.12.002	Delamanid is not metabolized by Salmonella or human nitroreductases: A possible mechanism for the lack of mutagenicity	Nitro-containing compounds such as nitrofuran and nitroimidazole are drugs used for the treatment of infectious diseases. However, many of these nitro-containing drugs are positive in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test). The recently approved anti-multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) drug, delamanid (Deltybaml; OPC-67683), a derivative of 4-nitroimidazole, was negative for mutagenicity in the Ames assay. In Salmonella typhimurium, mutagenicity of nitro compounds has been closely associated with the ability of nitroreductase to metabolize (degradation)these compounds. To explore the lack of mutagenicity for delamanid, we examined the initial metabolic rate and mutagenic-specific activity of a series of nitro compounds in S. typhimurium TA100. The order of maximum mutagenic-activity was nitrofuran > 2-nitroimidazole > 5-nitroimidazole > 4-nitroimidazole, which is very similar to the order of initial metabolic rate, i.e., the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r = 0.85) showed a correlation between metabolic rate and mutagenic-activity. No metabolism of delamanid was detected even after 60 h of treatment. In addition, delamanid was not reduced by two human nitroreductases. These facts may explain the absence of genotoxicity of delamanid in both in vitro and in vivo tests. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

10.1016_j.cmi.2016.09.006	Consensus numbering system for the rifampicin resistance-associated rpoB gene mutations in pathogenic mycobacteria	The rpoB gene codes for the RNA polymerase b subunit, which is the target of rifampicin, an essential drug in the treatment of tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections. This gene is present in all bacteria, but its length and nucleotide sequence vary between bacterial species, including mycobacteria. Mutations in the rpoB gene alter the structure of this protein and cause drug resistance. To describe the resistance-associated mutations, the scientific and medical communities have been using, since 1993, a numbering system based on the Escherichia coli sequence annotation. Using E. coli reference for describing mutations in mycobacteria leads to misunderstandings, particularly with the increasing use of whole genome sequencing, which brought an alternative numbering system based on the Mycobacterium tuberculosis rpoB sequence. We propose using a consensus numbering system for the reporting of resistance mutations based on the reference genomes from the species interrogated (such as strain H37Rv for M. tuberculosis). This manuscript provides the necessary figures and tables allowing researchers, microbiologists and clinicians to easily convert other annotation systems into one common language.

10.1183_13993003.00803_2016	An updated systematic review and meta-analysis for treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	This systematic review aimed to update the current evidence for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment. We searched for studies that reported treatment information and clinical characteristics for at least 25 patients with microbiologically confirmed pulmonary MDR-TB and either end of treatment outcomes, 6-month culture conversion or severe adverse events (SAEs). We assessed the association of these outcomes with patients' characteristics or treatment parameters. We identified 74 studies, including 17494 participants. The pooled treatment success was 26% in extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) patients and 60% in MDR-TB patients. Treatment parameters such as number or duration and individual drugs were not associated with improved 6-month sputum culture conversion or end of treatment outcomes. However, MDR-TB patients that received individualised regimens had higher success than patients who received standardised regimens (64% versus 52%; p<0.0.01). When reports from 20 cohorts were pooled, proportions of SAE ranged from 0.5% attributed to ethambutol to 12.2% attributed to para-aminosalicylic acid. The lack of significant associations of treatment outcomes with specific drugs or regimens may reflect the limitations of pooling the data rather than a true lack of differences in efficacy of regimens or individual drugs. This analysis highlights the need for stronger evidence for treatment of MDR-TB from better-designed and reported studies.

10.1183_13993003.02445_2016	Effectiveness and safety of clofazimine in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a nationwide report from Brazil	Although clofazimine is used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), there is scant information on its effectiveness and safety. The aim of this retrospective, observational study was to evaluate these factors as well as the tolerability of clofazimine in populations in Brazil, where it was administered at a daily dose of 100 mg center dot day(-1) (body weight. 45 kg) as part of a standardised MDR-TB treatment regimen until 2006 (thereafter pyrazinamide was used). All MDR-TB patients included in the Sistema de Informacao de Tratamentos Especiais da Tuberculose (SITETB) individual electronic register were analysed. The effectiveness of clofazimine was assessed by comparing the treatment outcomes of patients undergoing clofazimine-containing regimens against those undergoing clofazimine-free regimens and its safety by describing clofazimine-attributed adverse events. A total of 1446 patients were treated with clofazimine-containing regimens and 1096 with pyrazinamide-containing regimens. Although success rates were similar in patients treated with clofazimine versus those treated with pyrazinamide (880 out of 1446, 60.9%, versus 708 out of 1096, 64.6%; p=0.054), clofazimine-treated cases exhibited higher death rates due to tuberculosis than pyrazinamide-treated ones (314 out of 1446, 21.7%, versus 120 out of 1096, 10.9%) but fewer failures (78 out of 1446, 5.4%, versus 95 out of 1096, 8.7%) and less loss to follow-up (144 out of 1446, 10.0%, versus 151 out of 1096, 13.8%). No relevant differences were detected when comparing adverse events in patients treated with clofazimine-containing regimens to those treated with clofazimine-free regimens. However, the incidence of side-effects was less than previously reported (gastro-intestinal complaints: 10.5%; hyper-pigmentation: 50.2%; neurological disturbances: 9-13%).

10.5588_ijtld.16.0576	Latent tuberculous infection in household contacts of multidrug-resistant and newly diagnosed tuberculosis	BACKGROUND: Differences in the prevalence of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) and tuberculosis (TB) disease among contacts of patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and drug-susceptible TB are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence of tuberculin skin test (TST) positivity in household contacts of patients with MDR-TB and in contacts of patients never previously treated for TB ('new TB'). DESIGN: Consecutive patients with MDR-TB and their household contacts at nine urban district clinics in Viet Nam were screened for TB and LTBI, and followed up for 6 months. LTBI was defined as a TST result of at least 10 mm. RESULTS: A total of 167 patients with TB and their 337 household contacts were recruited. A total of 167/180 (25.8%) contacts of new TB patients and 60/147 (40.8%) contacts of MDR-TB patients were TST-positive (odds ratio [OR] 2.0, 95%CI 1.3-3.2). Contacts of MDR-TB patients were more likely to have baseline chest radiograph findings consistent with TB (OR 2.6, 95%CI 1.4-5.0). CONCLUSION: Contacts of MDR-TB patients have a high risk of developing TB. Measures to reduce Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission and accelerate the detection of disease among high-risk contacts should be prioritised to curb the MDR-TB epidemic.

10.5588_ijtld.16.0444	Pattern of first- and second-line drug resistance among pulmonary tuberculosis retreatment cases in Pakistan	BACKGROUND: Drug resistance in general, and multi drug -resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in particular, threatens global tuberculosis (TB) control efforts. Population-based estimates of drug resistance are needed to develop strategies for controlling drug-resistant TB in Pakistan. OBJECTIVE: To obtain population-based data on Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance in Pakistan. METHODS: To obtain drug resistance data, we conducted a population-based study of TB cases in all provinces of Pakistan. We performed culture and drug susceptibility testing on M. tuberculosis isolates from patients with a prior history of anti-tuberculosis treatment (retreatment cases) from all over the country. RESULTS: Of 544 isolates from previously treated cases, 289 (53.1%) were susceptible to all first-line drugs, 255 (46.9%) were resistant to at least one anti-tuberculosis drug and 132 (24.3%) were MDR-TB. Among MDR-TB isolates, 47.0% were ofloxacin (OFX) resistant. Extensively drug-resistant TB was found in two (0.4%) isolates. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of drug resistance in retreatment isolates was high. The alarmingly high prevalence of OFX resistance among MDR-TB isolates may threaten the success of efforts to control and treat MDR-TB.	drug resistance; retreatment cases; Pakistan	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; FLUOROQUINOLONES; PREVALENCE; TB; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT; PREDICTORS; OUTCOMES; REGIMEN; IMPACT
10.5588_ijtld.16.0155	Patterns of drug resistance among patients with tuberculous pleural effusion in Greece	SETTING: Data on the relationship between pleural tuberculosis (TB) and anti-tuberculosis drug resistance are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To determine the patterns of drug resistance among pleural Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in Greece and the incidence of tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) among patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR) pulmonary TB. DESIGN: Drug susceptibility testing (DST) results recorded in the database of the National Reference Centre for Tuberculosis in Athens, Greece, over a 9-year period (2003-2011) were reviewed. Chest X-rays from hospitalised patients with pulmonary MDR/XDR-TB during the same period were also reviewed for the presence of TPE. RESULTS: Resistance to at least one first-line drug was observed in 11% of the cases (MDR-TB 3%, XDR-TB 1%), while 29% of the patients with pulmonary MDR/XDR-TB presented with TPE during the course of their disease, the majority ipsilateral to the lung lesions, which responded to guided anti-tuberculosis treatment. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of drug resistance among pleural M. tuberculosis isolates in Greece highlights the importance of DST prior to treatment selection in TPE patients. In our study population, TPE that developed in one third of the patients with pulmonary MDR/XDR-TB usually resolved with DST guided anti-tuberculosis treatment.	tuberculous pleuritis; tuberculous pleurisy; isoniazid resistance; pleural biopsy	BIOPSY
10.5588_ijtld.16.0661	Outcomes from the first multidrug-resistant tuberculosis programme in Kenya	SETTING: In March 2006, the first multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment programme was implemented in Kenya. OBJECTIVE: To describe patients' treatment outcomes and adverse events. DESIGN: A retrospective case note review of patients started on MDR-TB treatment at two Medecins Sans Frontieres-supported sites and the national referral hospital of Kenya was undertaken. Sites operated an ambulatory model of care. Patients were treated for a minimum of 24 months with at least 4-5 drugs for the intensive phase of treatment, including an injectable agent. RESULTS: Of 169 patients, 25.6% were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive and 89.3% were culture-positive at baseline. Adverse events occurred in 67.4% of patients: 45.9% had nausea/vomiting, 43.9% electrolyte disturbance, 41.8% dyspepsia and 31.6% hypothyroidism. The median time to culture conversion was 2 months. Treatment outcomes were as follows: 76.6% success, 14.5% deaths, 8.3% lost to follow-up and 0.7% treatment failure. HIV-positive individuals (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-11.03) and women (aOR 2.73, 95%CI 1.01-7.39) had a higher risk of unfavourable outcomes, while the risk was lower in those with culture conversion at 6 months (aOR 0.11, 95%CI 0.04-0.32). CONCLUSION: In Kenya, where an ambulatory model of care is used for MDR-TB treatment, treatment success was high, despite high rates of HIV. Almost half of the patients experienced electrolyte disturbance and one third had hypothyroidism; this supports the view that systematic regular biochemical monitoring is needed in Kenya.	adverse events; HIV; Africa; culture conversion	MDR-TB; ADVERSE EVENTS; SOUTH-AFRICA; HIV; HYPOTHYROIDISM; METAANALYSIS; THERAPY
10.5588_ijtld.16.0191	Results of Xpert (R) MTB/RIF implementation in Kyrgyzstan	INTRODUCTION: In July 2012, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Quality Health Care Project introduced the Xpert MTB/RIF assay at the facility level of the primary health care system in Kyrgyzstan. This study analysed the results of the implementation of Xpert. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Test results from 2734 patients from July 2012 to December 2014 were analysed. The sensitivity and specificity of Xpert in routine programme conditions were evaluated using culture and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) as gold standard. Contribution to early start of treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) was expressed as the median time between availability of the test result and start of treatment. RESULTS: Compared to culture, the sensitivity and specificity of Xpert were respectively 92.7% and 90.4%. For the detection of rifampicin (RMP) resistance, Xpert sensitivity and specificity were respectively 90.1% and 90.7%. The median time to initiation of MDR-TB treatment decreased to 10 days (interquartile range [IQR] 6-16) in 2014 from 20 days (IQR 12-40, P < 0.001) in 2013. CONCLUSION: The Xpert assay demonstrated good agreement in the detection of both Mycobacterium tuberculosis and RMP-resistant pulmonary TB in routine clinical practice. Although Xpert improved the time to treatment initiation from 2013 to 2014, more efforts are needed to further reduce this delay.

10.1128_JCM.01865_16	Evaluation of the GenoType MTBDRsl Version 2.0 Assay for Second-Line Drug Resistance Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates in South Africa	Early detection of resistance to second-line antituberculosis drugs is important for the management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The GenoType MTBDRsl version 2.0 (VER 2.0) line probe assay has been redesigned for molecular detection of resistance-conferring mutations of fluoroquinolones (FLQ) (gyrA and gyrB genes) and second-line injectable drugs (SLID) (rrs and eis genes). The study evaluated the diagnostic performance of the GenoType MTBDRsl VER 2.0 assay for the detection of second-line drug resistance compared with phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST), using the Bactec MGIT 960 system on Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates from South Africa. A total of 268 repository isolates collected between 2012 and 2014, which were rifampin monoresistant or MDR based on DST, were selected. MTBDRsl VER 2.0 testing was performed on these isolates and the results analyzed. The MTBDRsl VER 2.0 sensitivity and specificity indices for culture isolates were the following: FLQ, 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 95.8 to 100%) and 98.9% (95% CI, 96.1 to 99.9%); SLID, 89.2% (95% CI, 79.1 to 95.6%) and 98.5% (95% CI, 95.7 to 99.7%). The sensitivity and specificity observed for individual SLID were the following: amikacin, 93.8% (95% CI, 79.2 to 99.2%) and 98.5% (95% CI, 95.5 to 99.7%); kanamycin, 89.2% (95% CI, 79.1 to 95.6%) and 98.5% (95% CI, 95.5 to 99.7%); and capreomycin, 86.2% (95% CI, 68.3 to 96.1%) and 95.9% (95% CI, 92.2 to 98.2%). An interoperator reproducibility of 100% and an overall interlaboratory performance of 93% to 96% were found. The overall improvement in sensitivity and specificity with excellent reproducibility makes the GenoType MTBDRsl VER 2.0 a highly suitable tool for rapid screening of clinical isolates for second-line drug resistance for use in high-burden TB/HIV settings.

10.1016_j.tube.2016.12.007	Single nucleotide polymorphisms may explain the contrasting phenotypes of two variants of a multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain	Globally, about 4.5% of new tuberculosis (TB) cases are multi-drug-resistant (MDR), i.e. resistant to the two most powerful first-line anti-TB drugs. Indeed, 480,000 people developed MDR-TB in 2015 and 190,000 people died because of MDR-TB. The MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis M family, which belongs to the Haarlem lineage, is highly prosperous in Argentina and capable of building up further drug resistance without impairing its ability to spread. In this study, we sequenced the whole genomes of a highly prosperous M-family strain (Mp) and its contemporary variant, strain 410, which produced only one recorded tuberculosis case in the last two decades. Previous reports have demonstrated that Mp induced dysfunctional CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell activity, suggesting that this strain has the ability to evade the immune response against M. tuberculosis. Comparative analysis of Mp and 410 genomes revealed non-synonymous polymorphisms in eleven genes and five intergenic regions with polymorphisms between both strains. Some of these genes and promoter regions are involved in the metabolism of cell wall components, others in drug resistance and a SNP in Rv1861, a gene encoding a putative transglycosylase that produces a truncated protein in Mp. The mutation in Rv3787c, a putative S-adenosyl-t-methioninedependent methyltransferase, is conserved in all of the other prosperous M strains here analysed and absent in non-prosperous M strains. Remarkably, three polymorphic promoter regions displayed differential transcriptional activity between Mp and 410. We speculate that the observed mutations/polymorphisms are associated with the reported higher capacity of Mp for modulating the host's immune response. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.1093_inthealth_ihw059	Strategies for halting the rise of multidrug resistant TB epidemics: assessing the effect of early case detection and isolation	Background: The increasing rates of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) have posed the question of whether control programs under enhanced directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS-Plus) are sufficient or implemented optimally. Despite enhanced efforts on early case detection and improved treatment regimens, direct transmission of MDR-TB remains a major hurdle for global TB control. Methods: We developed an agent-based simulation model of TB dynamics to evaluate the effect of transmission reduction measures on the incidence of MDR-TB. We implemented a 15-day isolation period following the start of treatment in active TB cases. The model was parameterized with the latest estimates derived from the published literature. Results: We found that if high rates (over 90%) of TB case identification are achieved within 4 weeks of developing active TB, then a 15-day patient isolation strategy with 50% effectiveness in interrupting disease transmission leads to 10% reduction in the incidence of MDR-TB over 10 years. If transmission is fully prevented, the rise of MDR-TB can be halted within 10 years, but the temporal reduction of MDR-TB incidence remains below 20% in this period. Conclusions: The impact of transmission reduction measures on the TB incidence depends critically on the rates and timelines of case identification. The high costs and adverse effects associated with MDR-TB treatment warrant increased efforts and investments on measures that can interrupt direct transmission through early case detection.

10.1111_tmi.12826	Treatment outcomes in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in north-west Ethiopia	ObjectiveMultidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is an emerging public health problem in Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to assess MDR-TB treatment outcomes and determine predictors of poor treatment outcomes in north-west Ethiopia. MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted using all MDR-TB patients who were enrolled at Gondar University Hospital since the establishment of the MDR-TB programme in 2010. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify the predictors of time to poor treatment outcomes, which were defined as death or treatment failure. ResultsOf the 242 patients who had complete records, 131 (54%) were cured, 23 (9%) completed treatment, 31 (13%) died, four (2%) experienced treatment failure, 27 (11%) were lost to follow-up, six (2%) transferred out, and 20 (8%) were still on treatment at the time of analysis. The overall cumulative probability survival of the patients at the end of treatment (which was 24 months in duration) was 80% (95% CI: 70%, 87%). The proportion of patients with poor treatment outcomes increased over time from 6% per person-year (PY) during 2010-2012, to 12% per PY during 2013-2015. The independent predictors of time to poor treatment outcome were being anaemic [AHR = 4.2; 95% CI: 1.1, 15.9] and being a farmer [AHR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.0, 4.9]. ConclusionsOverall, in north-west Ethiopia, the MDR-TB treatment success rate was high. However, poor treatment outcomes have gradually increased since 2012. Being a farmer and being anaemic were associated with poor treatment outcomes. It would be beneficial to assess other risk factors that might affect treatment outcomes such as co-infection with malaria, poverty and other socio-economic and biological risk factors.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; tuberculosis; outcomes; Ethiopia	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MDR-TB; COHORT; MORTALITY; CARE
10.1128_AAC.01400_16	Reduced Chance of Hearing Loss Associated with Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Aminoglycosides in the Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Hearing loss and nephrotoxicity are associated with prolonged treatment duration and higher dosage of amikacin and kanamycin. In our tuberculosis center, we used therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) targeting preset pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) surrogate endpoints in an attempt to maintain efficacy while preventing (oto) toxicity. To evaluate this strategy, we retrospectively evaluated medical charts of tuberculosis (TB) patients treated with amikacin or kanamycin in the period from 2000 to 2012. Patients with culture-confirmed multiresistant or extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/XDR-TB) receiving amikacin or kanamycin as part of their TB treatment for at least 3 days were eligible for inclusion in this retrospective study. Clinical data, including maximum concentration (C-max), C-min, and audiometry data, were extracted from the patients' medical charts. A total of 80 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean weighted C-max/MIC ratios obtained from 57 patients were 31.2 for amikacin and 12.3 for kanamycin. The extent of hearing loss was limited and correlated with the cumulative drug dose per kg of body weight during daily administration. At follow-up, 35 (67.3%) of all patients had successful outcome; there were no relapses. At a median dose of 6.5 mg/kg, a correlation was found between the dose per kg of body weight during daily dosing and the extent of hearing loss in dB at 8,000 Hz. These findings suggest that the efficacy at this lower dosage is maintained with limited toxicity. A randomized controlled trial should provide final proof of the safety and efficacy of TDM-guided use of aminoglycosides in MDR-TB treatment.	pharmacokinetics; pharmacodynamics; amikacin; TDM; tuberculosis; kanamycin; therapeutic drug monitoring	IN-VITRO ACTIVITIES; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; TRIMETHOPRIM-SULFAMETHOXAZOLE; ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS; AMIKACIN; PHARMACOKINETICS; KANAMYCIN; TOXICITY; PHARMACODYNAMICS; VARIABILITY
10.1016_j.meegid.2016.12.016	Tuberculosis cases caused by heterogeneous infection in Eastern Europe and their influence on outcomes	Introduction: Mycobacterium tuberculosis superinfection is known to occur in areas with high rates of tuberculosis (TB) and has a significant impact on overall clinical TB management. Aim: We aimed to estimate the superinfection rate in cohorts of drug sensitive and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) patients from Eastern Europe and the potential role of a second MDR TB strain infecting a patient with active non-MDR TB in treatment outcome. Methods: The study population included 512 serial M. tuberculosis isolates obtained from 84 MDR-and 136 non-MDR TB patients recruited sequentially at sites in Lithuania, Latvia and Russia in 2011-2013. Strains were genotyped using standardized 24-loci Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Unit-Variable Number Tandem Repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing. Results: Changes in two or more MIRU-VNTR loci suggesting superinfection were detected in 13 patients (5.9%). We found 4 initially non-MDR TB patients superinfected with an MDR TB strain during treatment and 3 of them had an unsuccessful outcome. Conclusions: An unsuccessful treatment outcome in patients initially diagnosed with drug sensitive TB might be explained by superinfection with an MDR TB strain. Bacteriological reversion could be indicative of superinfection with another strain. Archiving of all serial isolates and their genotyping in case of culture reversion could support therapeutic strategies in high MDR TB burden settings if resources are available.

10.1186_s12906_016_1521_2	Anti-mycobacteria potential and synergistic effects of combined crude extracts of selected medicinal plants used by Bapedi traditional healers to treat tuberculosis related symptoms in Limpopo Province, South Africa	Background: Tuberculosis is an infectious communicable disease and the causative agent of the disease has over the years developed resistance to streamline chemotherapeutic agents with dire consequences and there is a need for development of new and more potent alternatives. Methods: Constituents of leaves material of Combretum heroroense, Citrus lemon and Apodytes dimidiata were serially extracted using solvents of varying polarity. TLC finger print profile of the different extracts were determined by spraying eluted plates with vanillin sulphuric acid and 2, 2-diphenylpicryl hydrazyl (DPPH) for the presence of antioxidant constituents. Presence of different phytochemicals was determined using standard chemical test. Bioautography was used to determine the number of compounds present in sub-fractions active against Mycobacterium smegmatis. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values extract and sub-fractions were determined using serial microplate dilution method against M. smegmatis (ATCC 1441), M. tuberculosis (ATCC H37Rv) and multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) field strain. Synergy of the crude extracts of the three plants was determined using microplate dilution method against M. smegmatis. Results: Mass extracted by different solvents was less than 6% dry weight for all the plants. Phlobatannins were not detected in A. dimidiata, C. heroroense and C. lemon as well as cardiac glycosides in C. lemon and A. dimidiata, and saponins in C. heroroense. Sub-fractions of the different plants were shown to contain constituents with antioxidant activity with the highest number detected in C. heroroense. Bioautography results reveal the presence of a compound(s) in the ethyle acetate sub-fraction of C. heroroense and butanol, methanol/water, ethyl acetate and water no. 2 subfractions of A. dimidiata, active against M. smegmatis that were not shown to have antioxidant capacity. MIC results for different crude extracts of the three plants against M. smegmatis ranges from 0.1 to 3 mg/ml. The average MIC for the synergistic effect of the plants ranged from 0.04 mg/ml to 1.25 mg/ml. An activity greater than that obtained for the reference drugs was shown for the butanol and hexane fractions of A. dimidiata (0.47 mg/ml) against the field strain of MDR-TB while that obtained for the M. TB (ATCC H37Rv) was 0.31 mg/ml. Conclusion: A significant finding shown in this study reveals the potent anti-mycobacteria potential of sub-fractions of A. dimidiata against MDR-TB field strain that can lead to the isolation of compounds that can be used to counter resistant strains of tuberculosis.

10.1038_srep42814	Genetic diversity, transmission dynamics and drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Angola	Tuberculosis (TB) poses a serious public health problem in Angola. No surveillance data on drug resistance is available and nothing is known regarding the genetic diversity and population structure of circulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Here, we have genotyped and evaluated drug susceptibility of 89 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from Luanda. Thirty-three different spoligotype profiles corresponding to 24 different Shared International Types (SIT) and 9 orphan profiles were detected. SIT 20 (LAM1) was the most prevalent (n = 16, 18.2%) followed by SIT 42 (LAM9; n = 15, 17.1%). Overall, the M. tuberculosis population structure in this sample was dominated by LAM (64.8%) and T (33.0%) strains. Twenty-four-loci MIRU-VNTR analysis revealed that a total of 13 isolates were grouped in 5 distinct clusters. Drug susceptibility data showed that 22 (24.7%) of the 89 clinical isolates were resistant to one or more antibacillary drugs of which 4 (4.5%) were multidrug resistant. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a high predominance of LAM strains circulating in the Luanda setting and the presence of recent transmission events. The rate and the emergence dynamics of drug resistant TB found in this sample are significant and highlight the need of further studies specifically focused on MDR-TB transmission.

10.1186_s12889_017_4089_y	Financial barriers and coping strategies: a qualitative study of accessing multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and tuberculosis care in Yunnan, China	Background: Tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug-resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) pose serious challenges to global health, particularly in China, which has the second highest case burden in the world. Disparities in access to care for the poorest, rural TB patients may be exacerbated for MDR-TB patients, although this has not been investigated widely. We examine whether certain patient groups experience different barriers to accessing TB services, whether there are added challenges for patients with MDR-TB, and how patients and health providers cope in Yunnan, a mountainous province in China with a largely rural population and high TB burden. Methods: Using a qualitative study design, we conducted five focus group discussions and 47 in-depth interviews with purposively sampled TB and MDR-TB patients and healthcare providers in Mandarin, between August 2014 and May 2015. Field-notes and interview transcripts were analysed via a combination of open and thematic coding. Results: Patients and healthcare providers consistently cited financial constraints as the most common barriers to accessing care. Rural residents, farmers and ethnic minorities were the most vulnerable to these barriers, and patients with MDR-TB reported a higher financial burden owing to the centralisation and longer duration of treatment. Support in the form of free or subsidised treatment and medical insurance, was deemed essential but inadequate for alleviating financial barriers to patients. Most patients coped by selling their assets or borrowing money from family members, which often strained relationships. Notably, some healthcare providers themselves reported making financial and other contributions to assist patients, but recognised these practices as unsustainable. Conclusions: Financial constraints were identified by TB and MDR-TB patients and health care professionals as the most pervasive barrier to care. Barriers appeared to be magnified for ethnic minorities and patients coming from rural areas, especially those with MDR-TB. To reduce financial barriers and improve treatment outcomes, there is a need for further research into the total costs of seeking and accessing TB and MDR-TB care. This will enable better assessment and targeting of appropriate financial support for identified vulnerable groups and geographic development of relevant services.

10.1016_j.ejmech.2016.12.042	Synthesis and SAR evaluation of novel thioridazine derivatives active against drug-resistant tuberculosis	The neuroleptic drug thioridazine has been recently repositioned as possible anti-tubercular drug. Thioridazine showed anti-tubercular activity against drug resistant mycobacteria but it is endowed with adverse side effects. A small library of thioridazine derivatives has been designed through the replacement of the piperidine and phenothiazine moieties, with the aim to improve the anti-tubercular activity and to reduce the cytotoxic effects. Among the resulting compounds, the indole derivative 12e showed an antimycobacterial activity significantly better than thioridazine and a cytotoxicity 15-fold lower. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

10.1371_journal.pone.0172143	Has universal screening with Xpert (R) MTB/RIF increased the proportion of multidrugresistant tuberculosis cases diagnosed in a routine operational setting?	Setting Primary health services in Cape Town, South Africa where the introduction of Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) enabled simultaneous screening for tuberculosis (TB) and drug susceptibility in all presumptive cases. Study aim To compare the proportion of TB cases with drug susceptibility tests undertaken and multi drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) diagnosed pre-treatment and during the course of 1st line treatment in the previous smear/culture and the newly introduced Xpert-based algorithms. Methods TB cases identified in a previous stepped-wedge study of TB yield in five sub-districts over seven one-month time-points prior to, during and after the introduction of the Xpert-based algorithm were analysed. We used a combination of patient identifiers to identify all drug susceptibility tests undertaken from electronic laboratory records. Differences in the proportions of DST undertaken and MDR-TB cases diagnosed between algorithms were estimated using a binomial regression model. Results Pre-treatment, the probability of having a DST undertaken (RR = 1.82)(p<0.001) and being diagnosed with MDR-TB (RR =1.42)(p<0.001) was higher in the Xpert-based algorithm than in the smear/culture-based algorithm. For cases evaluated during the course of 1st-line TB treatment, there was no significant difference in the proportion with DST undertaken (RR = 1.02)(p = 0.848) or MDR-TB diagnosed (RR = 1.12)(p = 0.678) between algorithms. Conclusion Universal screening for drug susceptibility in all presumptive TB cases in the Xpert-based algorithm resulted in a higher overall proportion of MDR-TB cases being diagnosed and is an important strategy in reducing transmission. The previous strategy of only screening new TB cases when 1st line treatment failed did not compensate for cases missed pretreatment.

10.1371_journal.pone.0171800	Spatial patterns of multidrug resistant tuberculosis and relationships to socioeconomic, demographic and household factors in northwest Ethiopia	Background Understanding the geographical distribution of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in high TB burden countries such as Ethiopia is crucial for effective control of TB epidemics in these countries, and thus globally. We present the first spatial analysis of multidrug resistant tuberculosis, and its relationship to socio-economic, demographic and household factors in northwest Ethiopia. Methods An ecological study was conducted using data on patients diagnosed with MDR-TB at the University of Gondar Hospital MDR-TB treatment centre, for the period 2010 to 2015. District level population data were extracted from the Ethiopia National and Regional Census Report. Spatial autocorrelation was explored using Moran's I statistic, Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA), and the Getis-Ord statistics. A multivariate Poisson regression model was developed with a conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior structure, and with posterior parameters estimated using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation approach with Gibbs sampling, in WinBUGS. Results A total of 264 MDR-TB patients were included in the analysis. The overall crude incidence rate of MDR-TB for the six-year period was 3.0 cases per 100,000 population. The highest incidence rate was observed in Metema (21 cases per 100,000 population) and Humera (18 cases per 100,000 population) districts; whereas nine districts had zero cases. Spatial clustering of MDR-TB was observed in districts located in the Ethiopia-Sudan and Ethiopia-Eritrea border regions, where large numbers of seasonal migrants live. Spatial clustering of MDR-TB was positively associated with urbanization (RR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.04) and the percentage of men (RR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.26, 1.99) in the districts; after accounting for these factors there was no residual spatial clustering. Conclusion Spatial clustering of MDR-TB, fully explained by demographic factors (urbanization and percent male), was detected in the border regions of northwest Ethiopia, in locations where seasonal migrants live and work. Cross-border initiatives including options for mobile TB treatment and follow up are important for the effective control of MDR-TB in the region.		RISK-FACTORS; TRANSMISSION; REGION; PERU; MDR; TB
10.1186_s12879_017_2230_2	Risk factors for poor multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment outcomes in Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine	Background: Ukraine is among ten countries with the highest burden of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) worldwide. Treatment success rates for MDR-TB in Ukraine remain below global success rates as reported by the World Health Organization. Few studies have evaluated predictors of poor MDR-TB outcomes in Ukraine. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients initiated on MDR-TB treatment in the Kyiv Oblast of Ukraine between January 01, 2012 and March 31st,2015. We defined good treatment outcomes as cure or completion and categorized poor outcomes among those who died, failed treatment or defaulted. We used logistic regression analyses to identify baseline patient characteristics associated with poor MDR-TB treatment outcomes. Results: Among 360 patients, 65 (18.1%) achieved treatment cure or completion while 131 (36.4%) died, 115 (31.9%) defaulted, and 37 (10.3%) failed treatment. In the multivariate analysis, the strongest baseline predictors of poor outcomes were HIV infection without anti-retroviral therapy (ART) initiation (aOR 10.07; 95% CI 1.20-84.45; p 0.03) and presence of extensively-drug resistant TB (aOR 9.19; 95% CI 1.17-72.06; p 0.03). HIV-positive patients initiated on ART were not at increased risk of poor outcomes (aOR 1.43; 95% CI 0.58-3.54; p 0.44). There was no statistically significant difference in risk of poor outcomes among patients who received baseline molecular testing with Gene Xpert compared to those who were not tested (aOR 1.31; 95% CI 0.63-2.73). Conclusions: Rigorous compliance with national guidelines recommending prompt initiation of ART among HIV/TB co-infected patients and use of drug susceptibility testing results to construct treatment regimens can have a major impact on improving MDR-TB treatment outcomes in Ukraine.

10.1016_j.bmcl.2016.12.060	Preparation and biological evaluation of ethionamide-mesoporous silicon nanoparticles against Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Ethionamide (ETH) is an important second-line antituberculosis drug used for the treatment of patients infected with multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Recently, we reported that the loading of ETH into thermally carbonized-porous silicon (TCPSi) nanoparticles enhanced the solubility and permeability of ETH at different pH-values and also increased its metabolization process. Based on these results, we synthesized carboxylic acid functionalized thermally hydrocarbonized porous silicon nanoparticles (UnTHCPSi NPs) conjugated with ETH and its antimicrobial effect was evaluated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv. The activity of the conjugate was increased when compared to free-ETH, which suggests that the nature of the synergy between the NPs and ETH is likely due to the weakening of the bacterial cell wall that improves conjugate-penetration. These ETH-conjugated NPs have great potential in reducing dosing frequency of ETH in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.1166_jbmb.2017.1643	Concomitant Resistance to Ethambutol, Isoniazid and Rifampicin in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates from China	In order to investigate the characteristics of the ethambutol (EMB) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) 228 clinical cases were enrolled from the 2,129 isolates in the Beijing Tuberculosis and Thoracic Tumor Research Institute during 2009 and 2010. The results from the Drug susceptibility test (DST) showed that more than 63% of EMB-sensitive isolates and only 23.2% of EMB-resistant isolates were sensitive to both rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH). About 59% of EMB-resistant isolates and only 17% of EMB-sensitive isolates were using multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Of all the 228 EMB-resistant isolates, 84 isolates had a high resistance. Of those 84 isolates, 50% were resistant to high levels of INH, while 75% were resistant to high levels of RIF. EMB-resistant isolates had broader anti-Tuberculosis drug spectrums (2.19 +/- 0.10) than the EMB-sensitive isolates (0.79 +/- 0.04). In total, 162 (71.1%) contained mutations at embB306. An increased percentage of the embB306 mutations was found in the high RIF-resistant, MDR isolates, rather than in the INH-resistant ones. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of EMB were higher for the RFP/INH-resistant isolates than those of the RFP/INH-sensitive ones. In conclusion, resistance to EMB, INH and RIF concomitantly existed and were coadjutant. Furthermore, the high percentage of mutations at embB306 existed in RIF/INH-resistant isolates.

10.5588_ijtld.16.0493	Examples of bedaquiline introduction for the management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in five countries	BACKGROUND: For the first time in almost 50 years, there are new drugs available for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), including bedaquiline (BDQ) and delamanid (DLM). The rate of introduction, however, has not kept pace with patient needs. It is estimated that as many as 23% of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients have an indication for receiving BDQ. As this is the first time the MDR-TB community is introducing new medications, it is important to understand how implementation can be developed in a variety of settings. METHODS: A qualitative assessment of country TB programs in which more than 5% of MDR-TB patients were started on BDQ under program conditions. RESULTS: National TB programs in Belarus, France, SUMMARY Georgia, South Africa, and Swaziland all started sizeable cohorts of patients on BDQ in 2015. Common factors observed in these programs included experience with compassionate use/expanded access, support from implementing partners, and adequate national or donor-supported budgets. Barriers to introduction included restriction of BDQ to the in-patient setting, lack of access to companion drugs, and the development of systems for pharmacovigilance. CONCLUSION: The five countries in this paper are examples of the introduction of new therapeutic options for the treatment of TB.	tuberculosis; MDR-TB; BDQ; national TB programs; introduction	COHORT; COMPASSIONATE; PREVALENCE; DRUGS
10.1016_j.cmi.2016.10.006	A novel strategy based on genomics and specific PCR reveals how a multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain became prevalent in Equatorial Guinea 15 years after its emergence	Objective: Molecular epidemiology techniques in tuberculosis (TB) can identify high-risk strains that are actively transmitted. We aimed to implement a novel strategy to optimize the identification and control of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB in a specific population. Methods: We developed a strain-specific PCR tailored from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data to track a specific MDR prevalent strain in Equatorial Guinea (EG-MDR). Results: The PCR was applied prospectively on remnants of GeneXpert reaction mixtures owing to the lack of culture facilities in Equatorial Guinea. In 147 (93%) of 158 cases, we were able to differentiate between infection by the EG-MDR strain or by any other strain and found that 44% of all rifampicin-resistant TB cases were infected by EG-MDR. We also analysed 93 isolates obtained from Equatorial Guinea 15 years ago, before MDR-TB had become the problem it is today. We found that two of the scarce historical MDR cases were infected by EG-MDR. WGS revealed low variabilityd-six single nucleotide polymorphisms acquired by this strain over 15 yearsd-likely because of the lack in the country of a specific program to treat MDR-TB. Conclusions: Our novel strategy, which integrated WGS analysis and strain-specific PCRs, represents a low-cost, rapid and transferable strategy that allowed a prospective efficient survey and fast historical analysis of MDR-TB in a population.

10.1016_j.ijantimicag.2016.10.012	pncA mutations are associated with slower sputum conversion during standard treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Despite the strong association between drug resistance and genetic mutations, the value of molecular diagnosis of drug resistance to guide the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) remains unclear. This is particularly relevant in resource-limited areas where it is difficult to perform drug susceptibility testing (DST). Here we investigated the association between drug susceptibility phenotypes and genotypes and treatment outcomes in patients with MDR-TB. This study enrolled 74 consecutive patients with confirmed MDR-TB between 2010 and 2011, and outcomes were followed-up over the 24 month treatment course. All of the isolates were tested for phenotypic susceptibility to second-line drugs using the Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT)-based system, and genotypic mutations were assessed by DNA sequencing. Among the 74 MDR-TB isolates, 29 (39.2%) were resistant to fluoroquinolones and/or second-line injectable drugs, of which 21 (72.4%) harboured a mutation in drug resistancerelated genes (gyrA, rrs or eis). In addition, 32 individuals (43.2%) also had pyrazinamide (PZA)-resistant isolates, with 28 (87.5%) containing the pncA mutation. By backward selection in the multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models, PZA resistance and its related pncA gene mutation demonstrated a correlation with a lower likelihood of culture conversion at 8 weeks and treatment success. Meanwhile, the fluoroquinolone resistance-related gyrA gene mutation was negatively correlated with treatment success. DST for PZA and fluoroquinolones together with genetic information appears to provide a clinically useful indicator of the treatment outcome of MDR-TB in China.

10.1016_j.ijantimicag.2016.10.020	Confirming model-predicted pharmacokinetic interactions between bedaquiline and lopinavir/ritonavir or nevirapine in patients with HIV and drug-resistant tuberculosis	Bedaquiline and itsmetabolite M2 are metabolised by CYP3A4. The antiretrovirals ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) and nevirapine inhibit and induce CYP3A4, respectively. Here we aimed to quantify nevirapine and LPV/r drug-drug interaction effects on bedaquiline and M2 in patients co-infected with HIV and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) using population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and compare these with model-based predictions from single-dose studies in subjects without TB. An observational PK study was performed in three groups of MDR-TB patients during bedaquiline maintenance dosing: HIV-seronegative patients (n = 17); and HIV-infected patients using antiretroviral therapy including nevirapine (n = 17) or LPV/r (n = 14). Bedaquiline and M2 samples were collected over 48 h post-dose. A previously developed PK model of MDR-TB patients was used as prior information to inform parameter estimation using NONMEM. The model was able to describe bedaquiline and M2 concentrations well, with estimates close to their priors and earlier model-based interaction effects from single-dose studies. Nevirapine changed bedaquiline clearance to 82% (95% CI 67-99%) and M2 clearance to 119% (92-156%) of their original values, indicating no clinically significant interaction. LPV/r substantially reduced bedaquiline clearance to 25% (17-35%) and M2 clearance to 59% (44-69%) of original values. This work confirms earlier model-based predictions of nevirapine and LPV/r interaction effects on bedaquiline and M2 clearance from subjects without TB in single-dose studies, in MDR-TB/HIV co-infected patients studied here. To normalise bedaquiline exposure in patients with concomitant LPV/r therapy, an adjusted bedaquiline dosing regimen is proposed for further study. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

10.1128_JCM.02116_16	Whole-Genome Sequencing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Provides Insight into the Evolution and Genetic Composition of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Belarus	The emergence and spread of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (DR-TB) are critical global health issues. Eastern Europe has some of the highest incidences of DR-TB, particularly multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. To better understand the genetic composition and evolution of MDR- and XDR-TB in the region, we sequenced and analyzed the genomes of 138 M. tuberculosis isolates from 97 patients sampled between 2010 and 2013 in Minsk, Belarus. MDR and XDR-TB isolates were significantly more likely to belong to the Beijing lineage than to the Euro-American lineage, and known resistance-conferring loci accounted for the majority of phenotypic resistance to first-and second-line drugs in MDR and XDR-TB. Using a phylogenomic approach, we estimated that the majority of MDR-TB was due to the recent transmission of already-resistant M. tuberculosis strains rather than repeated de novo evolution of resistance within patients, while XDR-TB was acquired through both routes. Longitudinal sampling of M. tuberculosis from 34 patients with treatment failure showed that most strains persisted genetically unchanged during treatment or acquired resistance to fluoroquinolones. HIV+ patients were significantly more likely to have multiple infections over time than HIV+ patients, highlighting a specific need for careful infection control in these patients. These data provide a better understanding of the genomic composition, transmission, and evolution of MDR-and XDR-TB in Belarus and will enable improved diagnostics, treatment protocols, and prognostic decision-making.

10.1371_journal.pone.0170663	Determination of plasma concentrations of levofloxacin by high performance liquid chromatography for use at a multidrug-resistant tuberculosis hospital in Tanzania	Therapeutic drug monitoring may improve multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment outcomes. Levofloxacin demonstrates significant individual pharmacokinetic variability. Thus, we sought to develop and validate a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with ultraviolet (UV) detection for levofloxacin in patients on MDR-TB treatment. The HPLC-UV method is based on a solid phase extraction (SPE) and a direct injection into the HPLC system. The limit of quantification was 0.25 mu g/mL, and the assay was linear over the concentration range of 0.25(_)15 mu g/mL (y = 0.5668x(_)0.0603, R-2 = 0.9992) for the determination of levofloxacin in plasma. The HPLC-UV methodology achieved excellent accuracy and reproducibility along a clinically meaningful range. The intra-assay RSD% of low, medium, and high quality control samples (QC) were 1.93, 2.44, and 1.90, respectively, while the inter-assay RSD% were 3.74, 5.65, and 3.30, respectively. The mean recovery was 96.84%. This method was then utilized to measure levofloxacin concentrations from patients' plasma samples from a retrospective cohort of consecutive enrolled subjects treated for MDR-TB at the national TB hospital in Tanzania during 5/3/2013-8/31/2015. Plasma was collected at 2 hours after levofloxacin administration, the time of estimated peak concentration (eC(max)) treatment. Forty-one MDR-TB patients had plasma available and 39 had traceable programmatic outcomes. Only 13 (32%) patients had any plasma concentration that reached the lower range of the expected literature derived C-max with the median eC(max) being 5.86 (3.33-9.08 mu g/ml). Using Classification and Regression Tree analysis, an eC(max) >= 7.55 mu g/mL was identified as the threshold which best predicted cure. Analyzing this CART derived threshold on treatment outcome, the time to sputum culture conversion was 38.3 +/- 22.7 days vs. 47.8 +/- 26.5 days (p = 0.27) and a greater proportion were cured, in 10 out of 15 (66.7%) vs. 6 out of 18 (33.3%) (p = 0.06) respectively. Furthermore, one patient with an eC(max)/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of only 1.13 acquired extensively drug resistant (XDR)-TB while undergoing treatment. The individual variability of levofloxacin concentrations in MDR-TB patients from Tanzania supports further study of the application of onsite therapeutic drug monitoring and MIC testing.

10.1186_s12913_016_1931_3	Health outcomes of bedaquiline in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in selected high burden countries	Background: Less than one-third of patients who are estimated to be infected with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) receive MDR-TB treatment regimens, and only 48% of those who received treatment have successful outcomes. Despite current regimens, newer, more effective and cost-effective approaches to treatment are needed. The aim of the study was to project health outcomes and impact on healthcare resources of adding bedaquiline to the treatment regimen of MDR-TB in selected high burden countries: Estonia, Russia, South Africa, Peru, China, the Philippines, and India. Methods: This study adapted an existing Markov model to estimate the health outcomes and impact on total healthcare costs of adding bedaquiline to current MDR-TB treatment regimens. A price threshold analysis was conducted to determine the price range at which bedaquiline would be cost-effective. Results: Adding bedaquiline to the background regimen (BR) resulted in increased disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, and reduced total healthcare costs (excluding treatment acquisition costs) compared with BR alone in all countries analyzed. Addition of bedaquiline to BR resulted in savings to healthcare costs compared with BR alone in all countries analyzed, with the highest impact expected in Russia (US$ 194 million) and South Africa (US$ 43 million). The price per regimen at which bedaquiline would be cost-effective ranged between US$ 23,904US$ 203,492 in Estonia, Russia, Peru, South Africa, and China (high and upper middle-income countries) and between US$ 6,996-US$ 20,323 in the Philippines and India (lower middle-income countries); however, these cost-effective prices do not necessarily address concerns about affordability. Conclusions: Adding bedaquiline to BR provides improvements in health outcomes and reductions in healthcare costs in high MDR-TB burden countries. The range of prices per regimen for which bedaquiline would be cost-effective varied between countries.	DALY; Cost-effectiveness threshold	DISEASE
10.1371_journal.pone.0170980	Recurrence after Successful Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Taiwan	Recurrence after successful treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is challenging because of limited retreatment options. This study aimed to determine rates and predictors of MDR-TB recurrence after successful treatment in Taiwan. Recurrence rates were analyzed by time from treatment completion in 295 M DR-TB patients in a national cohort. Factors associated with MDR-TB recurrence were examined using a multivariate Cox regression analysis. Ten (3%) patients experienced MDR-TB recurrence during a median follow-up of 4.8 years. The overall recurrence rate was 0.6 cases per 1000 person-months. Cavitation on chest radiography was an independent predictor of recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 6.3; 95% CI, 1.2-34). When the analysis was restricted to 215 patients (73%) tested for second-line drug susceptibility, cavitation (aHR = 10.2; 95% CI, 1.2-89) and resistance patterns of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) or pre-XDR-TB (aHR = 7.3; 95% CI, 1.2-44) were associated with increased risk of MDR-TB recurrence. In Taiwan, MDR-TB patients with cavitary lesions and resistance patterns of XDR-TB or pre-XDR-TB are at the highest risk of recurrence. These have important implications for MDR-TB programs aiming to optimize post-treatment follow-up and early detection of recurrent MDR-TB.

10.1371_journal.pone.0168865	Impact of Multidrug Resistance on Tuberculosis Recurrence and Long-Term Outcome in China	Little is known about the impact of drug resistance on recurrence in TB. We conducted a cohort study to measure the impact of multi-drug resistance (MDR) on TB recurrence over nine years in Henan Province China. We reviewed medical records and conducted field interviews of 100 MDR and 150 non-MDR TB patients who were treated between 2001 and 2002. We compared long-term recurrence rates, risk factors, and outcomes in 2010 for 234 individuals who could be followed up. About one third (29.5%, 69/234) suffered recurrence after completion of treatment. The overall recurrence rate was 35/1,000 patient-years (PY), with a much higher rate (65/1,000 PY) among MDR-TB patients. MDR (HR: 2.75; CI: 1.58-4.79) and patient annual household income less than 10,000 Yuan (HR: 2.05; CI 1.11-3.80) were associated with recurrence. The mean time for recurrence among MDR-TB patients was 5.7 years, compared to 7.2 years among non-MDR-TB patients. Among the recurrence group members, 61.3% died, and 18.8% had failed treatments. We believe that the high TB recurrence rate after 9 years suggests that a high cure rate cannot accurately predict long-term outcome. We recommend that TB surveillance and control should be strengthened with a focus on MDR-TB and directly observed treatment, to reduce TB recurrence and transmission of MDR-TB.

10.1371_journal.pone.0170718	Reasons for Non-Enrollment in Treatment among Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis Patients in Hunan Province, China	In 2015, only 49% of notified multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients in China were estimated to have initiated treatment, compared with 90% of those worldwide. A case-control study was conducted to identify the reasons for non-enrollment in treatment among MDR-TB patients in Hunan province, China. All detected MDR-TB patients registered in designated MDR-TB hospitals in Hunan province from 2011 to 2014 were included and followed until June 2015 to determine their treatment status. Approximately 33.8% (482/1425) of patients were not enrolled in standardized treatment. Factors associated with lower enrollment rate were: age greater than 60 years, living in rural area, unemployed or occupation unreported. Of those who were not enrolled in MDR-TB treatment, the primary reasons for non-enrollment included economic hardship (23.0%), out-migration for work (18.0%), concerns about work and studies (13.7%), and the belief that they were cured after undergoing drug-sensitive TB treatment (12.4%). Therefore, comprehensive strategies targeting priority populations, especially those enhancing treatment affordability and availability, need to be implemented to improve MDR-TB control.		DIAGNOSIS
10.1186_s12879_017_2200_8	The effect of the Xpert MTB/RIF test on the time to MDR-TB treatment initiation in a rural setting: a cohort study in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province	Background: There are significant delays in initiation of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR -TB) treatment. The Xpert MTB/RIF test has been shown to reduce the time to diagnosis and treatment of MDR-TB predominantly in urban centres. This study describes the time to treatment of MDR-TB and the effect of Xpert MTB/RIF on time to treatment in a deprived rural area in South Africa. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study analysing the medical records of patients diagnosed with MDR-TB in King Sabata Dalindyebo Sub-District between 2009 and 2014. Numerical data were reported using the Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon sum rank tests and categorical data compared using the two-sample test of proportions. Results: Of the 342 patients with MDR-TB identified, 285 were eligible for analysis, of whom 145 (61.4%) were HIV positive. The median time from sputum collection to MDR-TB diagnosis was 27 days (IQR: 2-45) and differed significantly between diagnostic modalities: Xpert MTB/RIF, 1 day (IQR: 1-4; n = 114: p < 0.0001); Line Probe Assay 12 days (IQR: 8-21; n = 28; p < 0.0001); and culture/phenotypic drug sensitivity testing 45 days (IQR: 39-59; n = 143: p < 0.0001). The time from diagnosis to treatment initiation was 14 days (IQR: 8-27) and did not differ significantly between diagnostic modality. The median time from sputum collection to treatment initiation was 49 days (IQR: 20-69) but differed significantly between diagnostic modalities: Xpert MTB/RIF, 18 days (IQR: 11-27; n = 114; p < 0.0001); Line Probe Assay 29 days (IQR: 14.5-53; n = 28; p < 0.0001); and culture/phenotypic drug sensitivity, 64 days (IQR: 50-103; n = 143: P < 0.0001). Age, sex and HIV status did not influence the time intervals. Conclusions: Xpert MTB/RIF significantly reduced the time to MDR-TB treatment in a deprived rural setting as a result of a reduced time to diagnosis. However, the national target of five days was not achieved. Further research is needed to explore and address programmatic and patient-related challenges contributing to delayed treatment initiation.

10.1371_journal.pone.0167559	Development of a Patient-Centred, Psychosocial Support Intervention for Multi-Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Care in Nepal	Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) poses a major threat to public health worldwide, particularly in low-income countries. The current long (20 month) and arduous treatment regime uses powerful drugs with side-effects that include mental ill-health. It has a high loss to-follow-up (25%) and higher case fatality and lower cure-rates than those with drug sensitive tuberculosis (TB). While some national TB programmes provide small financial allowances to patients, other aspects of psychosocial ill-health, including iatrogenic ones, are not routinely assessed or addressed. We aimed to develop an intervention to improve psycho social well-being for MDR-TB patients in Nepal. To do this we conducted qualitative work with MDR-TB patients, health professionals and the National TB programme (NTP) in Nepal. We conducted semi-structured interviews (SSIs) with 15 patients (10 men and 5 women, aged 21 to 68), four family members and three frontline health workers. In addition, three focus groups were held with MDR-TB patients and three with their family members. We conducted a series of meetings and workshops with key stakeholders to design the intervention, working closely with the NTP to enable government ownership. Our findings highlight the negative impacts of MDR-TB treatment on mental health, with greater impacts felt among those with limited social and financial support, predominantly married women. Michie et al's (2011) framework for behaviour change proved helpful in identifying corresponding practice- and policy-level changes. The findings from this study emphasise the need for tailored psycho-social support. Recent work on simple psychological support packages for the general population can usefully be adapted for use with people with MDR-TB.		
10.1186_s12913_016_1954_9	Treating the invisible: Gaps and opportunities for enhanced TB control along the Thailand-Myanmar border	Background: In Thailand's northwestern Tak province, contextual conditions along the border with Myanmar pose difficulties for TB control among migrant populations. Incomplete surveillance data, migrant patient mobility, and loss to follow-up make it difficult to estimate the TB burden and implement effective TB control measures. This multi-methods study examined tuberculosis, tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus co-infection, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment accessibility for migrants and refugees in Tak province, health system response, and public health surveillance. Methods: In this study we conducted 13 interviews with key informants working in public health or TB treatment provision to elicit information on TB treatment availability and TB surveillance practices. In addition we organized 15 focus group discussions with refugee and migrant TB, TB/HIV, and MDR-TB patients and non-patients to discuss treatment access. We analyzed the data using thematic analysis and created treatment availability maps with Google maps. Results: The study identified surveillance, treatment, and funding gaps. Migrant TB cases are underreported in the provincial statistics due to jurisdictional interpretations and resource barriers. Our results suggest that TB/HIV and MDR-TB treatment options are limited for migrants and a heavy reliance on donor funding may lead to potential funding gaps for migrant TB services. We identified several opportunities that positively contribute to TB control in Tak province: improved diagnostics, comprehensive care, and collaboration through data sharing, planning, and patient referrals. The various organizations providing TB treatment to migrant and refugee populations along the border and the Tak Provincial Public Health Office are highly collaborative which offers a strong foundation for future TB control initiatives. Conclusions: Our findings suggest the need to enhance the surveillance system to include all migrant TB patients who seek treatment in Tak province and support efforts by stakeholders on both sides of the border to continue to share data and engage in collaborative planning on TB, TB/HIV, and MDR-TB treatment provision for migrant populations.

10.1371_journal.pone.0169798	Diagnostic Accuracy of GeneXpert MTB/RIF Assay in Comparison to Conventional Drug Susceptibility Testing Method for the Diagnosis of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Xpert MTB/RIF assay is regarded as a great achievement of modern medicine for the rapid diagnosis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The main purpose of this study was to determine the performance of Xpert MTB/RIF assay compared to conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST) method for the diagnosis of MDR-TB. A comparative cross sectional study was carried out at German-Nepal Tuberculosis Project, Kathmandu, Nepal, from April 2014 to September 2014. A total of 88 culture positive clinical samples (83 pulmonary and 5 extra-pulmonary) received during the study period were analyzed for detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis by both GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay and conventional DST method. McNemar chi square test was used to compare the performance of Xpert with that of DST method. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Of total 88 culture positive samples, one was reported as invalid while 2 were found to contain nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM). Among remaining 85 Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture positive samples, 69 were found to be MDR-TB positive by both methods. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay were found to be 98.6%, 100%, 100% and 93.8% respectively. Statistically, there was no significant difference between the diagnostic performance of Xpert and conventional DST method for detection of MDR-TB. GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay was found to be highly sensitive, specific and comparable to gold standard conventional DST method for the diagnosis of MDR-TB.

10.1371_journal.pone.0169413	Assessment of a 96-Well Plate Assay of Quantitative Drug Susceptibility Testing for Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Complex in China	Objective To evaluate the performance of the Sensitire MYCOTB MIC Plate (MYCOTB) which could measure the twelve anti-tuberculosis drugs susceptibility on one 96-wells plate. Methods A total of 140 MDR-TB strains and 60 non-MDR strains were sub-cultured and 193 strains were finally tested for drug resistance using MYCOTB and agar proportion method (APM) and another 7 strains failed of subculture. The drugs included ofloxacin (Ofx), moxifloxacin (Mfx), rifampin (RFP), amikacin (Am), rifabutin (Rfb), para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS), ethionamide (Eth), isoniazid (INH), kanamycin (Km), ethambutol (EMB), streptomycin (Sm), and cycloserine(Cs). The categorical agreement, conditional agreement, sensitivity and specificity of MYCOTB were assessed in comparison with APM. For strains with inconsistent results between MYCOTB and APM, the drug resistance related gene fragments were amplified and sequenced: gyrA for Ofx and Mfx; rpoB for RFP and Rfb; embB for EMB; rpsl for Sm; katG and the promoter region of inhA for INH, ethA and the promoter region of inhA for Eth. The sequence results were compared with results of MYCOTB and APM to analyze the consistency between sequence results and MYCOTB or APM. Results The categorical agreement between two methods for each drug ranged from 88.6% to 100%. It was the lowest for INH (88.6%). The sensitivity and specificity of MYCOTB ranged from 71.4% to 100% and 84.3% to 100%, respectively. The sensitivity was lowest for Cs (71.4%), EMB at 10 mu g/ml (80.0%) and INH at 10.0 mu g/ml (84.6%). The specificity was lowest for Rfb (84.3%). Overall discordance between the two phenotypic methods was observed for 96 strains, of which 63 (65.6%) were found susceptible with APM and resistant with MYCOTB and the remaining 33(34.4%) strains were resistant by APM and susceptible with MYCOTB. 34/52 (65.4%) sequenced APM susceptible and MYCOTB resistant(APM-S/ MYCOTB-R) strains had mutations or insertions in the amplified regions. 20/30 (66.7%) sequenced APM resistant and MYCOTB susceptible strains had mutations in the sequenced genes. MICs of twenty-nine of these thirty isolates were equal to or within 1 doubling dilution of the critical concentration. Conclusion MYCOTB had good performance for most of tested drugs and could be used as an alternative to the more labor demanding and longer turnaround time solid culture based DST method for detection of drug susceptibility in China.

10.1186_s12879_016_2114_x	Hospitalized care for MDR-TB in Port Harcourt, Nigeria: a qualitative study	Background: In Nigeria multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is prevalent in 2.9% of new TB cases and 14% of retreatment cases, and the country is one of 27 with high disease burden globally. Patients are admitted and confined to one of ten MDR-TB treatment facilities throughout the initial 8 months of treatment. The perspectives of MDR-TB patients shared on social media and in academic research and those of providers are limited to experiences of home-based care. In this study we explored the views of hospitalised MDR-TB patients and providers in one treatment facility in Nigeria, and describe how their experiences are linked to accessibility of care and support services, in line with international goals. We aimed to explore the physical, social and psychological needs of hospitalized MDR TB patients, examine providers' perceptions about the hospital based model and discuss the model's advantages and disadvantages from the patient and the provider perspective. Methods: We conducted two gender distinct focus group discussions and 11 in-depth interviews with recently discharged MDR-TB patients from one MDR-TB treatment facility in Nigeria. We triangulated this with the views of four providers who played key roles in the management of MDR-TB patients via key informant interviews. Transcribed data was thematically analysed, using an iterative process to constantly compare and contrast emerging themes across the data set for deeper understanding of the full range of participants' views. Results: The study findings demonstrate the psycho-social impacts of prolonged isolation and the coping mechanisms of patients in the facility. The dislocation of patients from their normal social networks and the detachment between providers and patients created the need for interdependence of patients for emotional and physical support. Providers' fears of infection contributed to stigma and hindered accessibility of care and support services. Conclusion: The current trend towards discharging patients after culture conversion would reduce the psycho-social impacts of prolonged isolation and potentially reduce the risk of occupational TB from prolonged contact with MDR-TB patients. Building on shared experiences and interdependence of MDR-TB patients in our study, innovative patient-centred support systems would likely help to reduce stigma, promote access to care and support services, and potentially impact on the outcome of treatment.

10.1080_07391102.2016.1227725	Antimycobacterial, docking and molecular dynamic studies of pentacyclic triterpenes from Buddleja saligna leaves	Buddleja saligna (family Buddlejaceae) is a medicinal plant endemic to South Africa. Two isomeric pentacyclic triterpenes, oleanolic acid and ursolic acid, were isolated from the leaves of B. saligna using silica gel column chromatography. Compounds oleanolic acid and ursolic acid were subjected to derivatization with acetic anhydride in the presence of pyridine to obtain oleanolic acid-3-acetate and ursolic acid-3-acetate, respectively. The structures of these compounds were fully characterized by detailed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) investigations, which included H-1 and C-13 NMR. Molecular docking studies predicted the free binding energy of the four triterpenes inside the steroid binding pocket of Mycobacterium tuberculosis fadA5 thiolase compared to a reported inhibitor. Thus, their ability to inhibit the growth of M. tuberculosis was predicted and was confirmed to possess significant antimycobacterial activity when tested against Mycobacterium smegmatis, M. tuberculosis H(37)Rv (ATCC 25177), clinical isolates of multi-drug-resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant M. tuberculosis (XDR-TB) using the Micro Alamar Blue Assay.

10.5114_ceji.2017.69362	Vaccine research and development: tuberculosis as a global health threat	One of the aims of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Millennium Development Goals (MDG) is to reduce the number of cases of tuberculosis (TB) infection by the year 2015. However, 9 million new cases were reported in 2013, with an estimated 480,000 new cases of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) globally. Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the most available and currently used candidate vaccine against tuberculosis; it prevents childhood TB, but its effectiveness against pulmonary TB in adults and adolescents is disputed. To achieve the goal of the WHO MDG, the need for a new improved vaccine is of primary importance. This review highlights several articles that have reported vaccine development. There are about 16 TB vaccines in different phases of clinical trials at the time of writing, which include recombinant peptide/protein, live-attenuated and recombinant live-attenuated, protein/adjuvant, viral-vectored, and immunotherapeutic vaccine. Further studies in reverse vaccinology and massive campaigns on vaccination are needed in order to achieve the target for TB eradication by 2050.	tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; vaccine; clinical trials; BCG vaccine	BACILLE CALMETTE-GUERIN; DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; HIV-INFECTED ADULTS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PROTECTIVE EFFICACY; IMMUNE-RESPONSE; FUSION PROTEIN; BCG VACCINE; TB VACCINE; IFN-GAMMA
pub-0209	Multi-drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in Tianjin, China from 2006 to 2015	Introduction: Drug resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) especially multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has become a serious public health problem in China and worldwide. We retrospectively analysed the Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST) of 4 Tuberculosis (TB) drugs in 10 years, and provide reference for the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis. Methods: 10856 strains were isolated from specimen of TB patients during 2006-2015 at our hospital; the liquid culture method was used for DST of 4 drugs-Streptomycin (S), Isoniazid (I), Rifampin (R) and Ethambutol (E). Analysis was performed for monodrug, polydrug and multi drug susceptibility testing. Results: The total drug resistance rate was 33.92% (3682/10856); the total monodrug resistance rate was 13.38% (1452/10856); the total Polydrug Resistant (PDR) rate was 7.88% (855/10856) and the total Multidrug Resistant (MDR) rate was 12.68% (1375/10856). The single drug resistance resistant rate of Isoniazid (I) was higher than the other 3 anti-tuberculosis drugs every year. The single and multi-drug resistant rates to ethambutol were low. The Multidrug Resistance (MDR-TB) rate was higher in local region than national average. Conclusion: Adjust the treatment plan of tuberculosis, strengthen the supervision and management are very necessary to control tuberculosis. More effective measures are still needed to curb the outbreaks and the recurrence rate of MDR-TB.

10.1155_2017_4563826	Prevalence and Molecular Characterization of Second-Line Drugs Resistance among Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates in Southwest of China	This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates resistant to the second-line antituberculosis drugs (SLDs) and its association with resistant-related genemutations inMycobacteriumtuberculosis (M.tb) isolates from Southwest of China. There were 81 isolates resistant to at least one of the SLDs among 156 MDR-TB isolates (81/156, 51.9%). The rates of general resistance to each of the drugs were as follows: OFX (66/156, 42.3%), KAN (26/156, 16.7%), CAP (13/156, 8.3%), PTO (11/156, 7.1%), PAS (22/156, 14.1%), and AMK (20/156, 12.8%). Therefore, the most predominant pattern was resistant to OFX compared with other SLDs (P < 0.001). The results of sequencing showed that 80.2% OFX-resistant MDR-TB isolates contained gyrA mutation and 88.5% KAN-resistant isolates had rrs mutations with the most frequent mutation being A1401G. These results suggest that improper use of SLDs especially OFX is a real threat to effective MDR-TB treatment not only in China but also in the whole world. Furthermore the tuberculosis control agencies should carry out SLDs susceptibility testing and rapid screening in a broader population of TB patients immediately and the SLDs should be strictly regulated by the administration in order tomaintain their efficacy to treat MDR-TB.

10.2147_IDR.S134369	Determinants of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has been jeopardizing the global effort to prevent and control tuberculosis (TB). However, data on MDR-TB in Ethiopia in general, and in our study area in particular, are very scarce. The aim of this study was to identify determinants of MDR-TB in a cohort of patients managed in two referral hospitals of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, between April 1, 2013 and June 30, 2013. A health facility-based case-control study was conducted. A total of 710 TB patients (229 confirmed MDR-TB and 481 drug susceptible TB patients) were enrolled in this study. Identified independent determinants for MDR-TB were contact history with a known TB patient (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.3), previous history of TB treatment (AOR: 11.9, 95% CI: 6.8-21), history of hospitalization (AOR: 4.4 95% CI: 2.2-7.8), sputum-smear positivity (AOR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.4), and social stigma (AOR: 5.1, 95% CI: 1.8-14.4). These identified factors should be considered for use in MDR-TB screening tool development if universal drug susceptibility testing is not possible. Moreover, TB infection control practices in health care settings should be further strengthened. As factors may vary from region to region, further broader studies need to be conducted in other parts of Ethiopia.

pub-0212	PULMONARY RESECTIONS FOR MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS - REPORT ON 31 CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS	The aim of this study is to present our experience in surgery of MDR-TB and to evaluate its role in addressing this epidemic. A total of 31 patients underwent surgery for MDR-TB between 2005 and 2014. They were 18 (43.8%) male and 13 (56.2%) female, with mean age of 37.9 years. None of them was HIV positive. Primary MDR-TB was found in two patients, while the other patients had secondary MDR. Drug resistance was observed to mean 4.1 of the drugs. All patients received individualized multiple-drug chemotherapy with mean 4 drugs. The mean duration of preoperative anti-TB treatment was 5.1 months. Fourteen (45.2%) patients remained culture positive before surgery. The following procedures were carried out: segmentectomy 1 (3.2%), lobectomy 21 (67.7%), lobectomy + S6 - 1 (3.2%) and pneumonectomy 8 (25.8%). The antituberculous treatment was suspended at the time of surgery and started again 48 hours later. The median postoperative follow-up period was 39 months. No 30-day postoperative mortality was observed. Postoperative minor complications were found in 5 (16.1%) patients. The mean postoperative length of stay was 8.1 days. Sputum conversion was achieved in all patients within 2 months after surgery. Recurrence was identified in two among negatively converted 14 patients. They were converted successfully 10 and 11 months after the relapse by adequate medication. Two late mortalities (6.4%) were observed in our series. The overall negative conversion rate after combined medical and surgical treatment in our cohort was 96.8%.	MDR-TB surgery; lung; surgery	SURGERY
pub-0213	Effect of type 2 diabetes mellitus on sputum negative conversion and treatment effects of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) on sputum negative conversion and treatment of Multi-Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB). We included a total of 359 MDR-TB patients for comparing the sputum negative conversion rates at 2, 6, and 12 months after initiating treatment and the recovery (treatment success) rates after completion of treatment for patients with T2DM (Group 2DM+) versus those without (Group 2DM-). A total of 20.6% of the patients (74/359) had T2DM; there were no significant differences in the sputum negative conversion rates between Group 2DM+ and Group 2DM-at 2 and 6 months (P>0.05), but the sputum negative conversion rate in Group 2DM+ at 12 months was significantly lower than that in Group 2DM-(P<0.05); the treatment success rates in Group 2DM+ and Group 2DM-were 56.8% and 79.3%, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). MDR-TB patients with T2DM had a higher recurrent sputum positive rate at the end of the 12-month treatment, and the success rate was relatively low. Therefore, these patients should undergo early screening for MDR-TB and be supervised during the entire treatment course; standardized management and treatment may be able to improve the treatment success rate.

pub-0214	Pyrazinamide resistance in MDR and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis.	Background: Pyrazinamide (PZA) is an important first-line antituberculosis drug in drug resistant and drug sensitive regimen. Incorporation of pyrazinamide into the first-line regimen had made it possible to reduce the treatment duration to six months. But drug resistant rate of PZA is high in MDR and XDR tuberculosis. Methods: We reviewed a phase II clinical trial in our hospital to identify the clinical characteristics of PZA resistant tuberculosis. Results: In our study, the mean time of anti-tuberculosis treatment before enrolled in the study was 2.6 +/- 3.1 years in the PZA resistant (PZAr) group and 2.3 +/- 1.4 years in the PZA sensitive (PZAs) group. The mean time of using PZA prior to the study in PZAr group and PZAs group were 1.1 +/- 2.0 years and 0.5 +/- 0.3 years respectively. The rate of PZA resistance was 80% (16/20) in MDR-TB and 100% (7/7) in XDR-TB. Conclusions: So whether to use PZA in MDR or XDR tuberculosis regimen still needs be identified.

10.2147_IDR.S130203	Genotypic distribution of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in northern Thailand	Background: Multidrug/extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (M/XDR-TB) is a major public health problem, and early detection is important for preventing its spread. This study aimed to demonstrate the distribution of genetic site mutation associated with drug resistance in M/XDR-TB in the northern Thai population. Methods: Thirty-four clinical MTB isolates from M/XDR-TB patients in the upper northern region of Thailand, who had been identified for drug susceptibility using the indirect agar proportion method from 2005 to 2012, were examined for genetic site mutations of katG, inhA, and ahpC for isoniazid (INH) drug resistance and rpoB for rifampicin (RIF) drug resistance. The variables included the baseline characteristics of the resistant gene, genetic site mutations, and drug susceptibility test results. Results: All 34 isolates resisted both INH and RIF. Thirty-two isolates (94.1%) showed a mutation of at least 1 codon for katG, inhA, and ahpC genes. Twenty-eight isolates (82.4%) had a mutation of at least 1 codon of rpoB gene. The katG, inhA, ahpC, and rpoB mutations were detected in 20 (58.7%), 27 (79.4%), 13 (38.2%), and 28 (82.3%) of 34 isolates. The 3 most common mutation codons were katG 315 (11/34, 35.3%), inhA 14 (11/34, 32.4%), and inhA 114 (11/34, 32.4%). For this population, the best genetic mutation test panels for INH resistance included 8 codons (katG 310, katG 340, katG 343, inhA 14, inhA 84, inhA 86, inhA 114, and ahpC 75), and for RIF resistance included 6 codons (rpoB 445, rpoB 450, rpoB 464, rpoB 490, rpoB 507, and rpoB 508) with a sensitivity of 94.1% and 82.4%, respectively. Conclusion: The genetic mutation sites for drug resistance in M/XDR-TB are quite variable. The distribution of these mutations in a certain population must be studied before developing the specific mutation test panels for each area. The results of this study can be applied for further molecular M/XDR-TB diagnosis in the upper northern region of Thailand.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; MDR-TB; XDR-TB; genotype; mutation	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; ISONIAZID RESISTANCE; PHENOTYPIC CHARACTERIZATION; RIFAMPICIN-RESISTANT; MUTATIONS; DIAGNOSIS; CHINA; GENE; TRANSMISSION; MYANMAR
10.4103_ijmr.IJMR_831_14	Line probe assay for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex: An experience from Central India	Background & objectives: Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex may sometimes not be detected in sputum samples of suspected multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients by line probe assay (LPA) even though they are smear positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). This retrospective analysis was attempted to understand and document our experience with LPA for detection of M. tuberculosis complex and diagnosis of MDR-TB under programmatic conditions. Methods: One thousand two hundred and ninety four sputum samples of MDR-TB suspects that were smear positive for AFB, and received from February to November 2013, were tested by LPA for the presence of M. tuberculosis complex and resistance to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin as per the diagnostic mandate of an accredited reference laboratory. As per the mandate, those samples that were negative for M. tuberculosis complex were cultured, and the growth again tested by LPA. A retrospective analysis of the results was carried out. Results: M. tuberculosis complex could be detected in 1217 (94.04%) but not in 77 (5.9%) of smear-positive sputum samples. Of the 1217 positive samples, 232 (19.1%) were MDR, 130 (10.6%) were rifampicin monoresistant and 101 (8.3%) were INH monoresistant. Seven hundred and fifty four (61.9%) strains were found to be pansensitive. Overall, 5.1 per cent of the sputum samples were negative for M. tuberculosis complex by LPA and culture. In at least 10 (0.77%) sputum samples smear positive for AFB, M. tuberculosis complex could not be identified by LPA though M. tuberculosis was present, as evidenced by culture positivity. Interpretation & conclusions: LPA is a robust technique for diagnosis of drug-resistant TB that has provided the basis for rapid and effective control of drug-resistant TB in India. While the reasons for concomitantly negative LPA and culture results of smear-positive sputum samples from MDR-TB suspects may be many, the possible presence of non-tubercular mycobacteria in these samples and the likelihood of inappropriate therapy in these patients cannot be ruled out. Addition of culture to the diagnostic algorithm may enhance the diagnostic yield.	Acid-fast bacilli; M. tuberculosis control band; MDR-TB; non-tubercular mycobacteria; smear positive	
10.4269_ajtmh.16_0579	First Insight into the Fluoroquinolone and Aminoglycoside Resistance of Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Saudi Arabia	In Saudi Arabia, there were no nationwide screening studies conducted so far to determine the aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone resistance among multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates. Therefore, as the first attempt in the country, a retrospective analysis has been conducted on a nationwide collection of 2,956 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates screened with phenotypic drug susceptibility testing to define MDR-TB. Enrolled MDR-TB isolates were subjected to second-line drug susceptibility testing, detection of mutations conferring resistance to aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolone, followed by 24-loci mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number of tandem repeat typing and spoligotyping. Overall, 83 isolates were identified as MDR-TB, and 13 (15.7%) isolates showed resistance to second-line drugs. Moxifloxacin (low level) showed higher resistant rates (10.8%) followed by ofloxacin (7.2%), capreomycin (3.6%), kanamycin (3.6%), and amikacin (2.4%). Overall fluoroquinolone resistance was 12%, whereas aminoglycoside resistance was 7.2%. Predominant mutations conferring resistance to fluoroquinolone were found in gyrA A90V and D94G, whereas aminoglycoside resistance was observed only with rrs gene A1401G mutation. The corresponding strain lineages predominated with Indo-Oceanic and East-African Indian origin. Interestingly, none of the isolates with second-line drug resistance was defined as extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). Surprisingly, many isolates (50.6%) were panresistant to first-line drugs. Saudi Arabia faces considerable burden of fluoroquinolone-and aminoglycoside-resistant MDR-TB. Higher incidence of panresistant MDR-TB reveals a threat for the emergence of XDR-TB strains in the near future.

pub-0218	Evaluation of efficiency of allele-specific real-time PCR assay for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with isoniazid resistance directly from sputum samples	Objective: As drug-resistant tuberculosis is a major threat to the control of tuberculosis, the aim of this study was to evaluate Allele-specific Real-time PCR (AS-RT-PCR) as a effective and accurate assay for the detection of isoniazid (INH) resistance for the treatment and control of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Methods: 230 clinical sputum specimens were detected by AS-RT-PCR and DNA sequencing. To evaluate the sensitivity and specifity of AS-RT-PCR, a series mixtures contained 100%, 10%, 1%, 0.1%, 0.05% and 0.001% MDR mutant plasmids and wildtype genomic DNA were made and tested by designed duplex real-time PCR. Results: The detection result of AS-RT-PCR was over 99% (228/230) consistent with the DNA sequencing. For the sensitivity and specifity, the limit of detection of mutant template was at the concentration of 0.05 similar to 0.1% in the mixture and the mutation positive rate was 21.7% according to the AS-RT-PCR assay. Conclusion: Allele-specific real-time PCR not only was a sensitive and specific assay to detect INH drug resistance, but also was a simple, fast method for MDR-TB monitoring and control.

10.1080_20469047.2016.1214796	Changing prevalence and resistance patterns in children with drug-resistant tuberculosis in Mumbai	Background: The prevalence of drug-resistant (DR) tuberculosis (TB) in children is increasing. Although, in India, multi-drug-resistant (MDR) TB rates have been relatively stable, the number of children with pre-extensively drug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB is increasing. Aim: To determine whether the prevalence of DR TB in children in Mumbai is changing and to study the evolving patterns of resistance. Methods: A retrospective study was undertaken in 1311 paediatric patients referred between April 2007 and March 2013 to the Paediatric TB clinic at B. J. Wadia Hospital for Children, Mumbai. Children were defined as having DR TB on the basis of drug susceptibility testing (DST) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis grown on culture of body fluids (in the case of extra pulmonary TB) or from gastric lavage/bronchi-alveolar lavage/sputum in patients with pulmonary TB or from DST of the contacts. The prevalence of DR TB was calculated and the type of DR was evaluated yearly and in the pre-2010 and post-2010 eras. Results: The overall prevalence of DR TB was 86 (6.6%) with an increase from 23 (5.6%) patients pre-2010 to 63 (7%) post-2010 (P=0.40). Nine (10.4%) patients were diagnosed on the basis of contact with a parent with DR TB. Overall fluoroquinolone resistance increased from 9 (39.1%) pre-2010 to 59 (93.7%) post-2010 (P=0.0001): moxifloxacin resistance increased from 2 (8.7%) to 29 (46%) (P=0.0018) and ofloxacin resistance increased from 7 (30.4%) to 30 (47.6%) (P=0.14). Ethionamide resistance also increased from 6 (26.1%) to 31 (49.2%) (P=0.04), aminoglycoside resistance was one (4.3%) pre-2010 and 12 (19%) post-2010 (P=0.17) and resistance remained virtually the same for both amikacin [0 pre-2010 and 6 (9.5%) after 2010] and kanamycin [one (4.3%) pre- and 6 (9.5%) post-2010]. Of the first-line drugs, resistance remained the same for isoniazid [23 (100%) to 61 (96.8%)], rifampicin [22 (95.7%) to 51 (80.9%),P=0.17], pyrazinamide [15 (65.2%) to 35 (55.6%), P=0.47], ethambutol [14 (60.9%) to 38 (60.3%), P=1.00] and streptomycin [19 (82.6%) to 50 (79.4%), P=1.00]. Resistance to PAS remained unchanged [2 (8.7%) to 5 (7.9%), P=1.00]. Conclusion: There is increasing resistance to second-line anti-tuberculosis (ATT) drugs, particularly flouroquinolones and ethionamide. Hence, there is an urgent need to avoid the use of ATT drugs for non-tuberculous infection and to increase surveillance for DR TB in adults as MDR TB in children is usually through contact with an adult with infectious MDR TB.

pub-0220	Diagnostic performance of GenoType MTBDRplus on culture specimens in smear-negative retreatment tuberculosis patients	Background: The diagnostic value of GenoType MTBDRplus assay hasn't been validated in smear-negative retreated tuberculosis (TB) patients. Therefore, a retrospective study was conducted to evaluate it. Methods: Between Jun, 2013 and Sep, 2016, 35 retreatment TB patients were enrolled in the study. The phenotypic drug susceptibility test (DST) was evaluated using indirect proportion method with L-J medium. The GenoType MTBDRplus assay was done on culture specimens according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio of GenoType MTBDRplus assay in detection of isoniazid (INH)and rifampicin (RIF)-resistance were calculated using the phenotypic DST assay as the gold standard. Results: The average age was 28.9 +/- 11.3 years (range 5 to 61 years), 57.1% (21/35) were male. For detecting INH-resistance, the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio of GenoType MTBDRplus assay were 94.1% (73.0%, 99.0%), 55.6% (33.7%, 75.4%), 2.12 (1.25, 3.60) and 0.106 (0.02, 0.74), respectively; For detecting RIF-resistance, the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 100% (85.1%, 100.0%), 91.7% (64.6%, 98.5%), 12.00 (1.84, 78.37) and 0, respectively; For detecting MDR-TB, the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 93.3% (70.2%, 98.8%), 65.0% (43.3%, 81.9%), 2.67 (1.45, 4.92) and 0.10 (0.02, 0.70), respectively. Conclusion: The GenoType MTBDRplus assay has high sensitivity for detection of INH-and RIF-resistance in retreatment TB patients. However, the specificity is moderate, this should be taken into account when interpreting the test results.

10.5588_ijtld.16.0110	Estimating the global burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among prevalent cases of tuberculosis	BACKGROUND: Estimates of the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) burden are based on incomplete, infrequently updated data among a limited pool of notified or incident pulmonary TB cases. METHODS: Using World Health Organization data reported by 217 countries/territories in 2014, we calculated the MDR-TB burden among prevalent TB cases and compared these with estimates among incident and notified TB patients. We also compared treatment coverage across estimates. RESULTS: Among prevalent TB patients worldwide in 2014, we estimate that 555 545 (95% credible bounds 499 340-617 391) MDR-TB cases occurred. This is 85% more than the 300 000 estimated among notified cases, and 16% more than the 480 000 among incident cases. Only 20% of MDR-TB cases among prevalent-compared to 37% of MDR-TB among notified TB patients had access to MDR-TB treatment. Applying prior estimates, only 10% of MDR-TB cases will have successful outcomes. CONCLUSION: Estimates based on likely-to-be-diagnosed cases of MDR-TB overlook a significant proportion of morbidity, mortality, and transmission that occur in undiagnosed, untreated, prevalent TB patients. Even though it may still likely underestimate the true disease burden, MDR-TB among patients with prevalent TB represents a closer approximation of disease burden than currently reported indicators. Progress toward elimination or control depends on policies guided by a more complete representation of the disease burden.	drug-resistant TB; epidemiology; prevalence	MDR-TB; DRUG-RESISTANCE; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; SURVEILLANCE DATA; UNIVERSAL ACCESS; METAANALYSIS
10.5588_ijtld.16.0384	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Bangladesh: results from a sentinel surveillance system	BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a serious obstacle to successful TB control. The 2010-2011 Bangladesh Drug Resistance Survey (DRS) showed MDR-TB prevalence to be 7% overall, 1.4% in new and 28.5% in previously treated patients. We aimed to determine the rate of MDR-TB in selected sentinel sites in Bangladesh. METHODS: Fourteen hospitals from the seven divisions in Bangladesh were selected as sentinel surveillance sites. Newly registered TB patients were systematically enrolled from August 2011 to December 2014. Sputum specimens were processed for culture and drug susceptibility testing by the proportion method using Lowenstein-Jensen medium. RESULTS: Specimens from 1906 (84%) of 2270 enrolled patients were analysed. Isolates from 61 (3.2%) were identified as having MDR-TB. The proportion of MDR-TB was 2.3% among new and 13.8% among previously treated TB patients (P < 0.001). The overall proportion of MDR-TB was 3.2%:3.5% in males and 2.3% in females; by age, the MDR-TB rate was highest (5.2%) in those aged >= 65 years. CONCLUSIONS: The high proportion of MDR-TB among new patients found in this sentinel surveillance significantly differs from that reported in the DRS. While the sentinel surveillance sites were not designed to be nationally representative, it is worrying to observe a higher number of MDR-TB cases among new patients.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; Bangladesh; surveillance; drug resistance	ANTITUBERCULOSIS-DRUG-RESISTANCE
10.5588_ijtld.16.0286	Anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in Ethiopia: systematic review	BACKGROUND: Resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs threatens to undermine effective control of tuberculosis (TB). In areas with weak TB control and misuse of antituberculosis drugs, hotspots of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) have appeared. The aim of this review is to determine the prevalence rate of any anti-tuberculosis drug resistance, monoresistance and MDR-TB in Ethiopia. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature on any resistance, monoresistance and MDR-TB was conducted. RESULTS: Of the total 468 articles found using electronic search, 14 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. The prevalence rate of any drug resistance, polyresistance and MDR-TB was respectively 6.7-72.9%, 0-54% and 0-46%. A higher rate of streptomycin monoresistance (1.5-20.4%) was observed. CONCLUSION: The prevalence and distribution of drug-resistant TB remains a serious public health problem in Ethiopia. Rapid, advanced diagnostic tools should be introduced, along with strong treatment and follow-up strategies.	anti-tuberculosis; drug resistance; Ethiopia	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; ADDIS-ABABA; EPIDEMIOLOGY
10.5588_ijtld.16.0433	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients' views of interventions to reduce treatment loss to follow-up	SETTING: Patients who initiated treatment for multi drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) at 15 Programmatic Management of Drug-resistant Tuberculosis (PMDT) health facilities in the Philippines between July and December 2012. OBJECTIVES: To describe patients' views of current interventions, and suggest changes likely to reduce MDR-TB loss to follow-up. METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted between April and July 2014 with MDR-TB patients who were undergoing treatment, had finished treatment at the time of the interview (controls), or had been lost to follow-up (LTFU). Responses were thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Interviews were conducted with 182 patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment and 91 LTFU patients. Views and suggestions could be thematically categorized as approaches to facilitate adherence or address barriers to adherence. The top themes were the need for transportation assistance or improvements to the current transportation assistance program, food assistance, and difficulties patients encountered related to their medications. These themes were addressed by respectively 63%, 60%, and 32% of the participants. CONCLUSIONS: A more patient-centered approach is needed to improve MDR-TB treatment adherence. Programs should strive to provide assistance that considers patient preferences, is adequate to cover actual costs or needs, and is delivered in a timely, uninterrupted manner.	adherence; incentives; enablers, patient-centered; qualitative study	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; ANTITUBERCULOSIS TREATMENT; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; ECONOMIC SUPPORT; SOUTH-AFRICA; TRUST; PHYSICIANS; LESSONS
10.1183_13993003.00993_2016	Group 5 drugs for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: individual patient data meta-analysis	"The role of so-called ""group 5"" second-line drugs as a part of antibiotic therapy for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is widely debated. We performed an individual patient data meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of several group 5 drugs including amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, thioacetazone, the macrolide antibiotics, linezolid, clofazimine and terizidone for treatment of patients with MDR-TB. Detailed individual patient data were obtained from 31 published cohort studies of MDR-TB therapy. Pooled treatment outcomes for each group 5 drug were calculated using a random effects meta-analysis. Primary analyses compared treatment success to a combined outcome of failure, relapse or death. Among 9282 included patients, 2191 received at least one group 5 drug. We found no improvement in treatment success among patients taking clofazimine, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or macrolide antibiotics, despite applying a number of statistical approaches to control confounding. Thioacetazone was associated with increased treatment success (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-6.1) when matched controls were selected from studies in which the group 5 drugs were not used at all, although this result was heavily influenced by a single study. The development of more effective antibiotics to treat drug-resistant TB remains an urgent priority."

10.2217_imt_2016_0079	Double-blind, placebo-controlled, 1:1 randomized Phase III clinical trial of Immunoxel honey lozenges as an adjunct immunotherapy in 269 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis	Aim: Safer and shorter antituberculosis treatment (ATT) regimens represent the unmet medical need. Patients & methods: The patients were randomly assigned into two arms: the first (n = 137) received once-daily sublingual honey lozenge formulated with botanical immunomodulator Immunoxel and the second (n = 132) received placebo lozenges along with conventional ATT. Immunoxel and placebo arms were demographically similar: 102 versus 106 had drug-susceptible TB; 28 versus 20 multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB); 7 versus 7 extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB); and 22 versus 20 TB-HIV. The primary end point was sputum smear conversion. Results: After 1 month 87 out 132 (65.9%) of Immunoxel recipients became sputum smear negative, whereas 32 out of 127 (25.2%) in placebo group had converted (p < 0.0001). Sputum clearance produced by Immunoxel was equally effective across all forms of TB. In the immunotherapy arm the average weight gain was 2 kg, but placebo recipients gained only 0.6 kg. Immunoxel reduced TB-associated inflammation as evidenced by defervescence and normalization of elevated leukocyte counts and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. No adverse effects were seen at any time. The liver function tests indicate that ATT-caused hepatotoxicity was counteracted by Immunoxel. These results are in agreement with prior 20 trials of Immunoxel conducted over the past 17 years. Conclusion: Immunoxel is affordable, safe, effective, fast-acting, commercially available immunotherapeutic intervention to supplement conventional TB chemotherapy.

10.1111_cei.12873	Mycobacterium tuberculosis multi-drug-resistant strain M induces IL-17(+)IFN gamma(-)CD4(+) T cell expansion through an IL-23 and TGF-beta-dependent mechanism in patients with MDR-TB tuberculosis	We have reported previously that T cells from patients with multi-drugresistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) express high levels of interleukin (IL)-17 in response to the MDR strain M (Haarlem family) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). Herein, we explore the pathways involved in the induction of Th17 cells in MDR-TB patients and healthy tuberculin reactors [purified protein derivative healthy donors (PPD+ HD)] by the M strain and the laboratory strain H37Rv. Our results show that IL-1 beta and IL-6 are crucial for the H37Rv and M-induced expansion of IL-17(+) interferon (IFN)-gamma(-) and IL-17(+) IFN-gamma(+) in CD4(+) T cells from MDR-TB and PPD 1 HD. IL-23 plays an ambiguous role in T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th17 profiles: alone, IL-23 is responsible for M. tuberculosis-induced IL-17 and IFN-gamma expression in CD4(+) T cells from PPD 1 HD whereas, together with transforming growth factor (TGF-beta), it promotes IL-17(+) IFN-gamma(-) expansion in MDR-TB. In fact, spontaneous and M. tuberculosis-induced TGF-beta secretion is increased in cells from MDR-TB, the M strain being the highest inducer. Interestingly, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 signalling mediates the expansion of IL-17(+) IFN-gamma(-) cells and the enhancement of latency-associated protein (LAP) expression in CD14(+) and CD4(+) T cells from MDR-TB, which suggests that the M strain promotes IL-17(+) IFN-gamma(-) T cells through a strong TLR-2-dependent TGF-beta production by antigen-presenting cells and CD4(+) T cells. Finally, CD4(+) T cells from MDR-TB patients infected with MDR Haarlem strains show higher IL-17(+) IFN-gamma(-) and lower IL-17(+) IFN-gamma(+) levels than LAM-infected patients. The present findings deepen our understanding of the role of IL-17 in MDR-TB and highlight the influence of the genetic background of the infecting M. tuberculosis strain on the ex-vivo Th17 response.	cytokines; multi-drug-resistance; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; pattern recognition receptors; Th17 cells	GROWTH-FACTOR-BETA; HUMAN TH17 CELLS; IFN-GAMMA; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; INTERFERON-GAMMA; EXPRESSION; IL-17; DIFFERENTIATION; PHENOTYPE; INFECTION
10.17179_excli2016_804	PREPARATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF BETA-GLUCAN PARTICLES CONTAINING A PAYLOAD OF NANOEMBEDDED RIFABUTIN FOR ENHANCED TARGETED DELIVERY TO MACROPHAGES	beta-glucan particles (GP) are polymeric carbohydrates, mainly found as components of cell wall fungi, yeast, bacteria and also in cereals such as barley and oat, and have been recently shown to have application in macrophagetargeted drug delivery. The aim of this study was to prepare and characterize GP containing a large payload of Rifabutin (RB), an anti-tuberculosis drug effective against MDR-TB at lower MIC than Rifampicin. GP were prepared from yeast cells by acidic and alkaline extraction were either spray dried or lyophilized, prior to RB loading and alginate sealing. The FTIR and C-13-NMR spectra of the GP confirmed a beta-(1 -> 3) linked glucan structure, with a triple-helical conformation. The spray dried GP exhibited better characteristics in terms of uniformity, size range (2.9 to 6.1 mu m) and more than 75 % particles were below 3.5 mu m. The RP-HPLC analysis of spray dried GP revealed drug entrapment and drug loading up to 81.46 +/- 4.9 % and similar to 40.5 +/- 1.9 %, respectively, as compared to those dried by lyophilization. Electron microscopy showed nearly spherical and porous nature of GP, and the presence of drug ` nanoprecipitates' filling the pore spaces. The formulation showed adequate thermal stability for pharmaceutical application. The particles were readily phagocytosed by macrophage(s) within 5 min of exposure. Drug release occurred in a sustained manner via diffusion, as the release kinetics best fit for drug release was obtained using Higuchi's equation. Thus, the spray dried GP-based-formulation technology holds promise for enhanced targeted delivery of anti-TB drug(s) to macrophage within a therapeutic window for the clearance of intracellular bacteria.

10.1080_21645515.2017.1264781	Preclinical study and clinical trial of a novel therapeutic vaccine against multi-drug resistant tuberculosis	[Purpose] Multi-drug resistant (MDR), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is a big problem in the world. We have developed novel TB therapeutic vaccine (HVJ-E/HSP65 DNA +IL-12 DNA). [Methods and Results] DNA vaccine expressing TB heat shock protein 65 and IL-12 was delivered by the hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-envelope. This vaccine provided remarkable protective efficacy and strong therapeutic efficacy against MDR-TB and XDR-TB in murine models. Furthermore, this vaccine provided therapeutic efficacy of prolongation of survival time of TB infected monkeys and augmented the immune responses. Therefore, the preclinical tests were studied for clinical trial. The injection of 100 mu g of the vaccine /mouse i.m. three times in two weeks induced significantly strong production of IFN-gamma and IL-2. 100 mu g and 200 mu g DNA vaccine/mouse i.m. augmented the production of these cytokines compared with 25 mu g DNA vaccine/mouse i.m.. The ratio of 100 mu g pDNA to 1AU HVJ-E enhanced the production of IFN-gamma and IL-2. The decrease in the number of M. tuberculosis in liver of mice was observed by the vaccination of 100 mu g pDNA. By using these conditions, safety pharmacology study and toxicology test is being studied in monkeys administered by GMP level DNA vaccines. By the toxicology test using monkeys, high dose GMP level vaccine/ monkey is administrated. Safety pharmacological study of repeated administration is also being investigated in GLP level. Furthermore, we have planned to do clinical phase I trial. Targets are human patients with MDR-TB. The safety and tolerability of the vaccine will be evaluated. [Conclusion and recommendations] These data indicate that our novel vaccine might be useful against tuberculosis including XDR-TB and MDR-TB for human therapeutic clinical applications.	clinical trial; XDR-TB; cytokines (IFN-gamma; IL-2; IL-6); immune responses against TB; mouse and monkey; multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.

10.2147_IDR.S127903	Molecular detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Jigjiga town, Ethiopia	Background: Molecular methods that target drug resistance mutations are suitable approaches for rapid drug susceptibility testing to detect multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The aim of the study was to determine MDR-TB cases and to analyze the frequency of gene mutations associated with rifampicin (RIF) and/or isoniazid (INH) resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis among smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients. Methods: Institution-based cross-sectional study design was employed. Sputum specimens were collected, and using a pretested questionnaire, data for associated risk factors for drug resistance were collected from 105 consecutive smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Karamara General Hospital. Specimens were transported to Harar Health Research and Regional Laboratory, Harar, where molecular drug susceptibility testing was performed using GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay. Results: Of the total 105 sputum specimens, 98 (93.3%) gave interpretable results, in which 67 (68.4%) were new cases and 31 (31.6%) were previously treated cases. Of these, 80 (81.6%) were sensitive to both drugs and 18 (18.4%) were resistant to RIF and/or INH. The prevalences of MDR-TB in total cases, new, and previously treated cases were 10 (10.2%), 3 (4.5%), and 7 (22.6%), respectively. Among the ten total RIF-resistant specimens, eight (80%) had resulted because of absence of rpoB WT8 and presence of MUT3 and in all specimens, the amino acids changed were Ser531Lue. Of the 18 total INH-resistant specimens, 15 (83.3%) had mutations in the katG gene (katG MUT1, Ser315Thr1), indicating high-level resistance, while 3 (14.7%) had mutations in the inhA promoter gene (Cys15Thr), indicating low-level resistance. Conclusion: Among the mutations associated with resistance to RIF and INH, the majority were in codon 531 of the rpoB gene and codon 315 of the katG gene. Relatively high prevalence of MDR-TB was observed in the study.

10.2147_IDR.S126274	Risk factors for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among tuberculosis patients: a case-control study	Background: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) did not receive major attention until recently in sub-Saharan Africa where the tuberculosis incidence and risk factors are highest. Factors leading to development of drug resistance need to be understood to develop appropriate control strategies for national programs. The objective of this study was to identify the risk factors for MDR-TB among tuberculosis patients. Methods: A case-control study was conducted to assess sociodemographic, behavioral and clinical risk factors using a structured questionnaire and clinical record reviewing. The data were entered and analyzed using SPSS windows version 16. Descriptive analysis was done to generate summary values for the variables and those significant variables in the bivariate analysis at p-value less than 0.25 were entered to multivariable logistic regression to identify independent determinants. Statistical significance was declared at p-value less than or equal to 0.05. Results: A total of 90 cases and 90 controls were included in the study. Age of respondents (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6-24.5), living in a household with only one room (AOR=5; 95% CI: 1.68-15.38), history of previous treatment (AOR=21; 95% CI: 17.8-28) and being HIV infected (AOR=3.1; 95% CI: 1.02-9.4) were found to be independent predictors of MDR-TB. Conclusion: In light of these findings, the strategies in controlling MDR-TB should emphasize on patients with HIV coinfection, young patients, those who have a history of previous treatment, and those living in crowded places.

10.1016_j.rppnen.2016.11.009	Comparison of bacteriological conversion and treatment outcomes among MDR-TB patients with and without diabetes in Mexico: Preliminary data	Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a well-known risk factor for tuberculosis (TB). However, it is not known to what extent DM affects the outcome in patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) treated with second-line anti-TB drugs. The objective of this study was to compare the microbiological evolution (sputum smear and culture conversion) and final outcomes of MDR/XDR-TB patients with and without DM, managed at the national TB reference centre in Mexico City. Results: Ninety patients were enrolled between 2010 and 2015: 73 with MDR-TB (81.1%), 11 with pre-XDR-TB (e.g. MDR-TB with additional resistance to one injectable drug or a fluoroquinolone, 12.2%) and 6 (6.7%) with XDR-TB. Out of these, 49 (54.4%) had DM and 42 (86%) were undergoing insulin treatment. No statistically significant differences were found in treatment outcomes comparing DM vs. non-DM MDR-TB cases: 18/32 (56.3%) of DM cases and 19/24 (79.2%) non DM patients achieved treatment success (p = 0.07). The time to sputum smear and culture conversion was longer (although not statistically) in patients without DM, as follows: the mean (+/- SD) time to sputum smear conversion was 53.9 (+/- 31.4) days in DM patients and 65.2 (+/- 34.8) days in non-DM ones (p = 0.15), while the time to culture conversion was 66.2 (+/- 27.6) days for DM and 81.4 (+/- 37.7) days for non-DM MDR-TB cases (p = 0.06). Conclusions: The study results support the Mexican National TB programme to strengthen itscollaboration with the DM programme, as an entry point for TB (and latent TB infection) screening and management.

10.1097_QAI.0000000000001169	High Treatment Success Rates Among HIV-Infected Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients After Expansion of Antiretroviral Therapy in Botswana, 2006-2013	Background: Few studies have examined multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcomes among HIV-infected persons after widespread expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We describe MDR-TB treatment outcomes among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients in Botswana after ART expansion. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data from patients who started MDR-TB therapy in Botswana during 2006-2013. Multi-variable regression models were used to compare treatment outcomes between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients. Results: We included 588 MDR-TB patients in the analysis, of whom, 47 (8.0%) and 9 (1.5%) were diagnosed with preextensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB and XDR-TB, respectively. Of the 408 (69.4%) HIV-infected patients, 352 (86.0%) were on ART or started ART during treatment, and median baseline CD4(+) T-cell count was 234 cells/mm(3). Treatment success rates were 79.4% and 73.0% among HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected patients, respectively (P = 0.121). HIV-infected patients with CD4(+) T-cell count < 100 cells/mm(3) were more likely to die during treatment compared with HIV-uninfected patients (adjusted risk ratio = 1.890; 95% CI: 1.098 to 3.254). Conclusions: High rates of treatment success were achieved with programmatic management of MDR-TB and HIV in Botswana after widespread expansion of ART. However, a 2-fold increase in mortality was observed among HIV-infected persons with baseline CD4(+) < 100 cells/mm(3) compared with HIV-uninfected persons.	tuberculosis; treatment outcomes; HIV/AIDS; immune suppression; antiretroviral therapy; MDR-TB	UNNECESSARY ADJUSTMENT; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; REGRESSION; OVERADJUSTMENT; MODELS; COHORT; ADULTS
10.7705_biomedica.v37i1.3174	Description of Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutations conferring resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid detected by GenoType (R) MTBDRplus V.2 in Colombia	Introduction: The GenoType (R) MTBDRp/usV.2 assay is a molecular technique endorsed by the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization that allows for the identification of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and the detection of mutations in the rpo beta gene for rifampicin resistance, and katG and inhA genes for isoniazid resistance. Due to the genetic variability in the circulating strains around the world, the national tuberculosis control programs should assess the performance of these new diagnostic technologies and their use under program conditions as rapid tests. Objective: To describe the mutations identified by the GenoType (R) MTBDRp/usV.2 assay in pulmonary samples and Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in the Laboratorio Nacional de Referencia of the lnstituto Nacional de Salud in 2014. Materials and methods. We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study to detect the expression of inhA, KatG and rpo beta genes, responsible for resistence against isoniazid and rifampicin using the GenoType (R) MTBDRplus V.2 assay in 837 samples and isolates from tuberculosis cases. Results: Several mutations in the rpo beta gene were identified. Ser531Leu was the most frequent (36.6%) followed by Asp516Val (21.6%), while Ser315Thr1 was the most frequent mutation in the katG gene (91.9%). Conclusions: We were able to identify different mutations present in MDR-TB strains in the country, with frequencies similar to those reported in other countries in the South American region.

10.7883_yoken.JJID.2015.629	Linezolid as a Potentially Effective Drug for the Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Japan	Linezolid (LZD) is classified as a WHO group 5 drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). Although its efficacy and long-term safety have not yet been established, it is being increasingly used in the treatment of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensive multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). The current study is a single-center retrospective clinical analysis of hospitalized M/XDR-TB patients in Fukujuji Hospital involving 26 patients (18 men and 8 women) consecutively treated with combinations of anti-TB drugs including LZD from 2009 to 2015. The sputum culture results were negative after using LZD for an average period of 28.0 +/- 12.0 (average +/- SD) days. LZD was reduced or withdrawn in 11 cases due to adverse effects. Nineteen cases including 3 XDR-TB patients were operated on, and their TB was treated following surgery. The average time from the initiation of LZD therapy to surgery was 87.6 +/- 38.7 (average +/- SD) days. Favorable clinical outcome was maintained in 23 surviving patients, while 3 patients died during treatment because of end stage cancer and aspiration pneumonia. Our study showed that LZD might be clinically effective in the treatment of M/XDR-TB patients in Japan.		EFFICACY; OUTCOMES
10.1016_j.tube.2016.10.007	Levels of microRNA miR-16 and miR-155 are altered in serum of patients with tuberculosis and associate with responses to therapy	Identification of blood biomarkers that can be useful for predicting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.TB) infection, effect of therapy and Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) TB infected individuals is clinically useful for combating tuberculosis epidemic. In this study, we have evaluated the levels of selected miRNAs in serum of TB and MDR TB patients. In addition, we have studied their levels in serum of patients post therapy. The levels of 4-miRNAs (miR-16, miR-29a, miR-125b and miR-155) were measured in 30 newly diagnosed TB patients, 19 Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) TB patients, 10 patients who completed TB therapy and were TB negative. 30 healthy individuals were recruited as controls. The levels of the miRNAs were estimated by qRT-PCR. Of the four miRNAs studied, the levels of miR-16 were significantly elevated and miR-155 were significantly reduced in serum of TB patients as compared to uninfected controls. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of miR-16 and miR-155 exhibited a significant distinguishing efficiency with an AUC value of 1 (95% CI, 1 to 1) and 0.967 (95% CI, 0.92-1.04) respectively. Following the therapy, the levels of miR-16 and miR-155 returned to those observed in healthy subjects. In patients with MDR TB, miR-155 was lower as compared to healthy controls and TB treated group but higher as compared to TB na ve patients. miR-16 levels were lowest in serum of MDR TB patients compared to TB na ve, TB treated group and healthy controls. In conclusion, miR-16 and miR-155 in serum may act as surrogate biomarker for studying TB infection, progression of therapy and MDR TB. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.1007_s00203_016_1267_8	Proteomic analysis of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis and charge chromatography	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of TB caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) that do not respond to, at least, isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most powerful, first-line (or standard) anti-TB drugs. Novel intervention strategies for eliminating this disease were based on finding proteins that can be used for designing new drugs or new and reliable kits for diagnosis. The aim of this study was to compare the protein profiles of MDR-TB with sensitive isolates. Proteomic analysis of M. tuberculosis MDR-TB and sensitive isolates was obtained with ion exchange chromatography coupled with MALDI-TOF-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization) in order to identify individual proteins that have different expression in MDR-TB to be used as a drug target or diagnostic marker for designing valuable TB vaccines or TB rapid tests. We identified eight proteins in MDR-TB isolates, and analyses showed that these proteins are absent in M. tuberculosis-sensitive isolates: (Rv2140c, Rv0009, Rv1932, Rv0251c, Rv2558, Rv1284, Rv3699 and MMP major membrane proteins). These data will provide valuable clues in further investigation for suitable TB rapid tests or drug targets against drug-resistant and sensitive M. tuberculosis isolates.

10.1371_journal.pone.0169188	Evaluation of Direct Colorimetric MTT Assay for Rapid Detection of Rifampicin and Isoniazid Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	With the spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains there is an increasing need for new accurate and cost-effective methods for a rapid diagnostic and drug susceptibility testing (DST), particularly in low-income countries where tuberculosis is hyperendemic. A colorimetric assay using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) has been suggested as a promising method for DST, especially to rifampicin. In this study, we standardized and evaluated the MTT assay for a rapid direct detection of rifampicin and isoniazid resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains from sputum specimens using Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) culture medium as a gold standard. The MTT assay sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for rifampicin were 100%, 86%, 100%, 99%, respectively. For isoniazid, the MTT assay had a 100% sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values. Interestingly, the MTT assay gave interpretable results within two weeks for 94% of the samples compared to 7-14 weeks for LJ media. Overall, an excellent agreement was observed between MTT assay and LJ proportion method (Kappa, 0.91 for rifampicin and 1.00 for isoniazid). In conclusion, the direct colorimetric MTT assay simultaneously detects susceptible and resistant strains of M. tuberculosis within three weeks. It significantly shortens the time required to obtain a DST result and could be a reliable alternative method for rapid detection of drug-resistant TB strains in high-TB-burden resource-limited settings.

10.1038_srep39050	Multicenter evaluation of crystal violet decolorization assay (CVDA) for rapid detection of isoniazid and rifampicin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	The aim of this multicenter study was to evaluate the performance of the crystal violet decolorization assay (CVDA) for detection of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). This study was performed in 11 centers in two phases. A total of 156 isolates were tested for INH and RIF resistance. In the phase I, 106 clinical isolates were tested in the Center 1-7. In the phase 2, 156 clinical isolates were tested in the center 1-6, center 8-11. Eighty six of 156 tested isolates were the same in phase I. Agreements were 96.2-96.8% for INH and 98.1-98.7% for RIF in the phase I-II, respectively. Mean time to obtain the results in the phase I was 14.3 +/- 5.4 days. In the phase II, mean time to obtain the results was 11.6 +/- 3.5 days. Test results were obtained within 14days for 62.3% (66/106) of isolates in the phase I and 81.4% (127/156) of isolates in the phase II. In conclusion, CVDA is rapid, reliable, inexpensive, and easy to perform for rapid detection of MDR-TB isolates. In addition, it could be adapted for drug susceptibility testing with all drugs both in developed and developing countries.

10.1073_pnas.1610978113	Discovery of cofactor-specific, bactericidal Mycobacterium tuberculosis InhA inhibitors using DNA-encoded library technology	Millions of individuals are infected with and die from tuberculosis (TB) each year, and multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of TB are increasingly prevalent. As such, there is an urgent need to identify novel drugs to treat TB infections. Current frontline therapies include the drug isoniazid, which inhibits the essential NADH-dependent enoyl-acyl-carrier protein (ACP) reductase, InhA. To inhibit InhA, isoniazid must be activated by the catalase-peroxidase KatG. Isoniazid resistance is linked primarily to mutations in the katG gene. Discovery of InhA inhibitors that do not require KatG activation is crucial to combat MDR TB. Multiple discovery efforts have been made against InhA in recent years. Until recently, despite achieving high potency against the enzyme, these efforts have been thwarted by lack of cellular activity. We describe here the use of DNA-encoded X-Chem (DEX) screening, combined with selection of appropriate physical properties, to identify multiple classes of InhA inhibitors with cell-based activity. The utilization of DEX screening allowed the interrogation of very large compound libraries (10(11) unique small molecules) against multiple forms of the InhA enzyme in amultiplexed format. Comparison of the enriched library members across various screening conditions allowed the identification of cofactor-specific inhibitors of InhA that do not require activation by KatG, many of which had bactericidal activity in cell-based assays.

10.3389_fmicb.2016.01947	Correlation of rpoB Mutations with Minimal Inhibitory Concentration of Rifampin and Rifabutin in Mycobacterium tuberculosis in an HIV/AIDS Endemic Setting, South Africa	Treatment of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV co-infections is often complicated by drug to -drug interactions between anti-mycobacterial and anti-retroviral agents. Rifabutin (RFB) is an alternative to rifampin (RIF) for TB regimens and is recommended for HIV patients concurrently receiving protease inhibitors because of reduced induction of CYP3A4. This study sought to determine the proportion of RFB susceptible isolates among RIF-resistant strains in a high HIV prevalence setting in South Africa. In addition, the study explored the association between rpoB mutations and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of RIF and RFB. A total of 189 multidrug resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from the Centre for Tuberculosis repository were analyzed. The MICs were determined using a MYCOTB Sensititre plate method and the rpoB gene was sequenced. Of the 189 MDR isolates, 138 (73%) showed resistance to both RIF and RFB, while 51 (27%) isolates were resistant to RIF but retained susceptibility to RFB. The S531L was the most frequent rpoB point mutation in 105/189 (56%) isolates, followed by H526Y in 27/189 (14%) isolates. Resistance to both RIF and RFB was found predominantly in association with mutations 5531L (91/105, 87%), H526Y (20/27, 74%), and H526D (15/19, 79%), while D516V (15/17, 88%), and L533P (3/4, 75%) were found in RIF-resistant, RFB-susceptible isolates. This study has shown that up to 27% of MDR-TB patients in South Africa may benefit from a treatment regimen that includes RFB.

10.1089_mdr.2015.0186	Proportions and Risk Factors of Developing Multidrug Resistance Among Patients with Tuberculosis in China: A Population-Based Case-Control Study	Aims: Limited studies have been conducted to explore risk factors of developing multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in China. This study aimed to find the proportions and risk factors of developing MDR-TB in China among new patients and previously treated tuberculosis (TB) patients. Methods: A population-based case-control study was conducted from March 2010 to December 2013 in five cities in China. Proportions and risk factors of developing MDR-TB were calculated and analyzed separately for new patients and previously treated patients. Results: The proportion of MDR-TB was 3.9% among new patients and 25.3% among previously treated patients in our study population. The proportion of extensively drug resistant TB was 0.1% among new patients and 1.4% among previously treated patients in our study population. Multivariate analysis found that being registered as migrants (odds ratio [OR]=6.08; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.75-21.09), having more than three affected lung fields (OR=2.18; 95% CI: 1.20-2.94), having more than 8 months of initial treatment (OR=2.15; 95% CI: 1.09-4.28), having more than three prior episodes of anti-TB treatment (OR=3.10; 95% CI: 1.48-6.48), and experiencing failure or continued worsening from the last treatment (OR=3.82; 95% CI: 1.86-7.85) were associated with developing MDR-TB in previously treated patients with TB. Univariate analysis showed that less than 30 years of living in the same location (p=0.034) was a risk factor for new patients with MDR-TB. Conclusion: The surveillance of multidrug resistance among patients with previously treated TB who also possess these risk factors and the management of patients with MDR-TB should be reinforced.	tuberculosis; multidrug resistance; risk factors; China	PREVIOUSLY-TREATED PATIENTS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; INFECTED PATIENTS; HIGH PREVALENCE; EUROPE
10.5588_ijtld.16.0096	Factors associated with sputum culture conversion in multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis	INTRODUCTION:Sputum culture conversion in pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is important to make treatment-related decisions and prevent transmission of disease. OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with sputum culture conversion, and to determine time to culture conversion and the impact of culture conversion on successful treatment outcomes in MDR-/rifampicin (RMP) resistant TB. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of data from treatment cards and registers of MDR-/RMP-resistant patients initiated on treatment under India's Revised National TB Control Programme in Delhi, West Bengal and Kerala from January 2009 to December 2011. Proportions were calculated and logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Of 836 patients, 787 were analysed, 651 (83%) of whom experienced culture conversion: respectively 57%, 73% and 79% culture converted by month 3, 4 and 6 of treatment. The median time to culture conversion was 91.3 days. Patients with body mass index (BMI) <16 kg/m(2) (OR 0.403, P = 0.001) and 1618 kg/m(2) (OR 0.519, P= 0.039) were less likely to have culture conversion. High rates of culture conversion were observed in patients with successful treatment outcomes compared to those without treatment success (462/469, 99% vs. 183/311, 59%; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Low BMI is associated with poor sputum culture conversion in MDR-/RMP-resistant TB patients. Lack of culture conversion can impact successful treatment outcomes.	predictors; treatment outcomes; drug resistance; BMI	MDR-TB; PREDICTORS
10.1002_cpt.507	Benefit-Risk Analysis for Decision-Making: An Approach	The analysis of benefit and risk is an important aspect of decision-making throughout the drug lifecycle. In this work, the use of a benefit-risk analysis approach to support decision-making was explored. The proposed approach builds on the qualitative US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approach to include a more explicit analysis based on international standards and guidance that enables aggregation and comparison of benefit and risk on a common basis and a lifecycle focus. The approach is demonstrated on six decisions over the lifecycle (e.g., accelerated approval, withdrawal, and traditional approval) using two case studies: natalizumab for multiple sclerosis (MS) and bedaquiline for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).

10.1016_j.tube.2016.07.010	Transmission of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in Mongolia is driven by Beijing strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to all first-line drugs	Background: Mongolia has high and rising rates of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Spatio-temporal and programmatic evidence suggests a major contribution from MDR-TB transmission, but genotypic evidence has not been assessed. Methods: All MDR-TB cases identified during 2012 were examined. Demographic and bacteriological data were obtained from the National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory. Isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from culture-confirmed category 1 treatment failures were genotyped using 24-loci mycobacterium interspersed repetitive unit (MIRU-24) analysis. Results: Of the 210 MDR-TB cases identified,115 (54.8%) were treatment failures (34.8% category 1; 20.0% category 2). Streptomycin resistance was present in 156 (74.3%) cases; including 55/73 (75.3%) category 1 treatment failures who had never been exposed to streptomycin. Among category 1 treatment failures, Beijing lineage strains predominated (88.0%; 59/67 of genotyped isolates). MIRU-24 clustering was documented in 62.7% (42/67) of strains; 55.2% (37/67) remained clustered when drug susceptibility test results were considered. In total 59.5% (25/42) of clustered strains were Beijing lineage and demonstrated in-vitro resistance to all first-line drugs tested. Conclusion: The MDR-TB epidemic in Mongolia appears to be driven by primary transmission of Beijing lineage strains resistant to all first-line drugs. Enhanced infection control strategies together with early MDR-TB case detection and appropriate treatment are necessary to limit escalation of the MDR-TB epidemic. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

10.1186_s12916_016_0723_2	Modelling the effect of short-course multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment in Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan	Background: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major threat to global TB control. MDR-TB treatment regimens typically have a high pill burden, last 20 months or more and often lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. A 9-11 month regimen with seven antibiotics has shown high success rates among selected MDR-TB patients in different settings and is conditionally recommended by the World Health Organization. Methods: We construct a transmission-dynamic model of TB to estimate the likely impact of a shorter MDR-TB regimen when applied in a low HIV prevalence region of Uzbekistan (Karakalpakstan) with high rates of drug resistance, good access to diagnostics and a well-established community-based MDR-TB treatment programme providing treatment to around 400 patients. The model incorporates acquisition of additional drug resistance and incorrect regimen assignment. It is calibrated to local epidemiology and used to compare the impact of shorter treatment against four alternative programmatic interventions. Results: Based on empirical outcomes among MDR-TB patients and assuming no improvement in treatment success rates, the shorter regimen reduced MDR-TB incidence from 15.2 to 9.7 cases per 100,000 population per year and MDR-TB mortality from 3.0 to 1.7 deaths per 100,000 per year, achieving comparable or greater gains than the alternative interventions. No significant increase in the burden of higher levels of resistance was predicted. Effects are probably conservative given that the regimen is likely to improve success rates. Conclusions: In addition to benefits to individual patients, we find that shorter MDR-TB treatment regimens also have the potential to reduce transmission of resistant strains. These findings are in the epidemiological setting of treatment availability being an important bottleneck due to high numbers of patients being eligible for treatment, and may differ in other contexts. The high proportion of MDR-TB with additional antibiotic resistance simulated was not exacerbated by programmatic responses and greater gains may be possible in contexts where the regimen is more widely applicable.

10.1371_journal.pone.0165222	Population-Based Drug Resistance Surveillance of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Taiwan, 2007-2014	Objective To determine the extent of drug resistance in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases, we conducted a retrospective, population-based analysis using drug susceptibility testing (DST) results of MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates obtained from 2007-2014 in Taiwan. Methods M. tuberculosis isolates collected from 1,331 MDR-TB cases were included in this survey. Treatment histories, age, sex, chest radiograph and bacteriological results of patients were analyzed. Standard DST was performed to assess resistance to the following drugs: isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), streptomycin (SM), ethambutol (EMB), amikacin (AM), kanamycin (KM), capreomycin (CAP), ofloxacin (OFX), moxifloxacin (MOX), levofloxacin (LVX), gatifloxacin (GAT), para-aminosalicylate (PAS), ethionamide (EA), and pyrazinamide (PZA). The Cochran-Armitage trend test was used for statistical analysis. Results We observed a significant increasing trend in portion of new MDR-TB cases, from 59.5% to 80.2% (p < 0.0001), and significant decreasing trend of portion in the 15-44-year-old age group (p < 0.05). Of the MDR M. tuberculosis isolates tested, 6.2% were resistant to AM, 8.6% were resistant to KM, 4.6% were resistant to CAP, 19.5% were resistant to OFX, 17.1% were resistant to MOX, 16.0% were resistant to LVX, 5.8% were resistant to GAT, 9.5% were resistant to PAS, 28.5% were resistant to EA and 33.3% were resistant to PZA. Fifty (3.8%) extensively drug-resistant TB cases were identified. No significant differences were found in drug resistance frequencies between new and previously treated MDR cases. However, we observed significant decreases in the rates of AM resistance (p < 0.05), OFX resistance (p < 0.00001), PAS resistance (p < 0.00001), EA resistance (p < 0.05) and PZA resistance (p < 0.05). Moreover, younger age groups had higher rates of resistance to fluoroquinolones. Conclusion A policy implemented in 2007 to restrict the prescription of fluoroquinolones was shown to be effective. Our survey revealed a decreasing trend of resistance to PZA, OFX and AM, which suggests the feasibility of adopting a short- course regimen and demonstrates the effectiveness of our management program for MDR-TB.		
10.3389_fmicb.2016.01816	Cytosolic Proteome Profiling of Aminoglycosides Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Clinical Isolates Using MALDI-TOF/MS	Emergence of extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is the consequence of the failure of second line TB treatment. Aminoglycosides are the important second line anti-TB drugs used to treat the multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Main known mechanism of action of aminoglycosides is to inhibit the protein synthesis by inhibiting the normal functioning of ribosome. Primary target of aminoglycosides are the ribosomal RNA and its associated proteins. Various mechanisms have been proposed for aminoglycosides resistance but still some are unsolved. As proteins are involved in most of the biological processes, these act as a potential diagnostic markers and drug targets. In the present study we analyzed the purely cytosolic proteome of amikacin (AK) and kanamycin (KM) resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates by proteomic and bioinformatic approaches. Twenty protein spots were found to have over expressed in resistant isolates and were identified. Among these Ry3208A, Rv2623, Rv1360, Rv2140c, Rv1636, and Ry2185c are six proteins with unknown functions or undefined role. Docking results showed that AK and KM binds to the conserved domain (DUF, USP-A, Luciferase, PEBP and Polyketidecyclase/dehydrase domain) of these hypothetical proteins and over expression of these proteins might neutralize/modulate the effect of drug molecules. TBPred and GPS-PUP predicted cytoplasmic nature and potential pupylation sites within these identified proteins, respectively. String analysis also suggested that over expressed proteins along with their interactive partners might be involved in aminoglycosides resistance. Cumulative effect of these over expressed proteins could be involved in AK and KM resistance by mitigating the toxicity, repression of drug target and neutralizing affect. These findings need further exploitation for the expansion of newer therapeutics or diagnostic markers against AK and KM resistance so that an extreme condition like XDR-TB can be prevented.	amikacin; bioinformatic tools; kanamycin; cytosolic proteome; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; resistance	2-DIMENSIONAL GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS; FAST INTERACTION REFINEMENT; MOLECULAR DOCKING; PROTEINS; EXPRESSION; KANAMYCIN; AMIKACIN; BINDING; GENE; OVEREXPRESSION
10.1186_s12879_016_1993_1	Infection control and tuberculosis among health care workers in Viet Nam, 2009-2013: a cross-sectional survey	Background: Data on tuberculosis (TB) among health care workers (HCW) and TB infection control (TBIC) indicators are rarely available at national level. We assessed multi-year trends in notification data of TB among HCW and explored possible associations with TBIC indicators. Methods: Notified TB incidence among HCW and 3 other TBIC indicators were collected annually from all 64 provincial and 3 national TB facilities in Vietnam. Time trends in TB notification between 2009 and 2013 were assessed using linear regression analysis. Multivariate regression models were applied to assess associations between the facility-specific 5-year notification rate and TBIC indicators. Results: Forty-seven (70 %) of 67 facilities contributed data annually over five years; 15 reported at least one HCW with TB in 2009 compared to six in 2013. The TB notification rate dropped from 593 to 197 per 100,000 HCW (ptrend = 0.02). Among 104 TB cases reported, 30 were employed at TB wards, 24 at other clinical wards, ten in the microbiology laboratory, six at the MDR-TB ward, and 34 in other positions. The proportion of facilities with a TBIC plan and focal person remained relatively stable between 70 % and 84 %. The proportion of facilities providing personal protective equipment (PPE) to their staff increased over time. Facilities with a TBIC focal person were 7.6 times more likely to report any TB cases than facilities without a focal person. Conclusions: The TB notification rates among HCW seemed to decrease over time. Availability of PPE increased over the same period. Appointing a TBIC focal person was associated with reporting of TB cases among HCW. It remains unclear whether TBIC measures helped in reduction of the TB notification rates in HCW.

10.1016_j.ejmech.2016.07.039	Synthesis and biological activity of furoxan derivatives against Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Tuberculosis (TB) remains a serious health problem responsible to cause millions of deaths annually. The scenario becomes alarming when it is evaluated that the number of new drugs does not increase proportionally to the emergence of resistance to the current therapy. Furoxan derivatives, known as nitric oxide (NO) donors, have been described to exhibit antitubercular activity. Herein, a novel series of hybrid furoxan derivatives (1,2,5-oxadiazole 2-N-oxide) (compounds 4a-c, 8a-c and 14a-c) were designed, synthesized and evaluated in vitro against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTh) H(37)Rv (ATCC 27294) and a clinical isolate MDR-TB strain. The furoxan derivatives have exhibited MIC90 values ranging from 1.03 to 62 mu M (H(37)Rv) and 7.0-50.0 mu M (MDR-TB). For the most active compounds (8c, 14a, 14b and 14c) the selectivity index ranged from 3.78 to 52.74 (MRC-5 cells) and 1.25-34.78 (J774A.1 cells). In addition, it was characterized for those compounds logP(o/w), values between 2.1 and 2.9. All compounds were able to release NO at levels ranging from 0.16 to 44.23%. Among the series, the phenylsulfonyl furoxan derivatives (compounds 14a-c) were the best NO-donor with the lowest MIC90 values. The most active compound (14c) was also stable at different pHs (5.0 and 7.4). In conclusion, furoxan derivatives were identified as new promising compounds useful to treat tuberculosis.

10.1371_journal.pone.0164974	Early Outcomes Of Decentralized Care for Rifampicin-Resistant Tuberculosis in Johannesburg, South Africa: An Observational Cohort Study	Objective We describe baseline characteristics, time to treatment initiation and interim patient outcomes at a decentralized, outpatient treatment site for rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB). Methods Prospective observational cohort study of RR-TB patients from March 2013 until December 2014. Study subjects were followed until completion of the intensive phase of treatment (6 months), transfer out, or a final outcome (loss from treatment (LFT) or death). Results 214 patients with RR-TB were enrolled in the study. Xpert MTB/RIF was the diagnostic test of rifampicin resistance for 87% (n = 186), followed by direct PCR on AFB positive specimen in 14 (7%) and indirect PCR on cultured isolate in 5 (2%). Median time between sputum testing and treatment initiation was 10 days (IQR 6-21). Interim outcomes were available in 148 patients of whom 78% (n = 115) were still on treatment, 9% (n = 13) had died, and 14% (n = 20) were LFT. Amongst 131 patients with culture positive pulmonary TB, 85 (64.9%) were culture negative at 6 months, 12 were still sputum culture positive (9.2%) and 34 had no culture documented or contaminated culture (26%). Patients who initiated as outpatients within 1 week of sputum collection for diagnosis of RR-TB had a significantly lower incidence of LFT (IRR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.09-0.98). HIV co-infection occurred in 178 patients (83%) with a median CD4 count 88 cells/ml 3 (IQR 27-218). Conclusions Access to decentralized treatment coupled with the rapid diagnosis of RR-TB has resulted in short time to treatment initiation. Despite the lack of treatment delays, early treatment outcomes remain poor with high rates of death and loss from care.		MDR-TB; TRANSMISSION; KHAYELITSHA; DIAGNOSIS; SETTINGS; DELAY
10.1016_j.jfma.2015.10.002	Prognostic factors of treatment among patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Egypt	Background/purpose: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) represents 5% of TB cases globally. In Egypt, it represents 11.4% of TB cases (2.2% of new and 38.2% of previously treated). Our objectives were to evaluate the treatment outcomes and determine the associated prognostic factors among the first national treatment cohort of MDR-TB from 2006 to 2010. Methods: All patients diagnosed with MDR-TB from July 2006 to December 2010 who were admitted to Abbassia Chest Hospital, the first Egyptian national center established for MDR-TB treatment, were included. They were followed up clinically, radiologically, and bacteriologically by sputum smear, culture, and drug-susceptibility testing at regular intervals. Individualized treatment regimens were prescribed according to each patient's drug-susceptibility testing and the drug treatment history. Patients received at least five effective drugs. Outcome rates, and crude and adjusted odds ratios of unsuccessful outcomes were calculated. Results: The number of bacteriologically proven MDR-TB patients was 228, of which 225 were pulmonary cases. Half of the cases showed moderate or extensive lung lesions, and 15.8% were diabetics. A total of 158 (119 cured and 39 completed treatment) patients achieved successful outcome (69.3%), 16 (7.1%) failed treatment, 27 (11.8%) were lost to follow up, and 27 (11.8%) died. Predictors of unsuccessful outcome were delay in sputum culture conversion to 2 months or more, moderate or extensive lung lesions, and a history of diabetes. Conclusion: A treatment success rate of approximately 69% was achieved with the first national treatment cohort of MDR-TB under the Egyptian program. Predictors of unsuccessful treatment were delayed culture conversion, moderate or extensive lung affection, and diabetes. Copyright (C) 2015, Formosan Medical Association.

10.1016_j.rppnen.2016.06.006	Effectiveness and safety of imipenem/clavulanate and linezolid to treat multidrug and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis at a referral hospital in Brazil	Evidence on effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of imipehem/clavulanate (IC) and linezolid containing regimens to treat multidrug-resistant (MDR-) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is scarce. The aim of this observational study is to evaluate the therapeutic contribution of IC and linezolid to manage MDR/XDR-TB cases at the reference centre of Sao Paulo state, Brazil. Twelve patients (9 males, 1 HIV positive in antiretroviral treatment, 4 MDR, 8 XDR) were treated with IC, 11 of them within linezolid-containing regimens. They all were previously treated with treatment failure, for a median (IQR, interquartile range) of 4.5 (2-6.5) times, having a severe resistance pattern (median number of resistances: 7 (5-8)) and being sputum smear and culture positive. IC and linezolid were prescribed at the dose of 1000 mg/day and 600 mg/day, respectively. The overall exposure was (median (IQR)) 419 (375.5-658) days for IC and 678 (392-720) days for linezolid. All of them converted their sputum (time to sputum conversion; 60 (37.5-90) days) and culture (75 (60-135) days), and 7 were cured while 5 are still on treatment with a gradually improving clinical picture. While no adverse events were reported for IC, 2 minor side effects, only, were attributed to linezolid (17%); in both cases the drug was re-started without further problems. Our study suggests that IC and linezolid-containing regimens can be used safely and with satisfactory outcomes in reference centres to treat MDR/XDR-TB patients.

pub-0255	Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Detection of Resistance to Rifampin and Isoniazid through Direct Molecular Methods in Stool Samples	Background Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb). TB has high morbidity and mortality around the world.Objective To evaluate molecular-based methods performed directly on stool samples for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and to determine the susceptibility to Rifampicin (RMP) and Isoniazid (INH). Study design This is a descriptive study evaluating the performance of the PCR-based method for direct PTB diagnosis and to determine the susceptibility of RMP and INH using stool samples from PTB patients. The study was conducted between March 2011 and March 2014. Methods Three stool samples and three sputum samples (n=300 stool and 300 sputum) were collected from 100 PTB patients (75 pretreatment and 25 follow up). Stool samples (n=60) were also collected from 20 healthy individuals to serve as controls. DNA was extracted from stool samples using Chelex (R)-100. PTB was diagnosed using a Genekam (R) kit. RMP and INH susceptibility testing was performed using the Genotype MTBDRplus (R) assay. The sputum Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) culture and agar proportion method (PM) of drug susceptibility testing for INH and RMP were considered to be the gold standard methods for comparing the results of the molecular methods. Results The Genekam kit showed 100% sensitivity and 95.24% specificity for diagnosing new patients and showed 100% sensitivity and 80% specificity for follow-up patients. The Genotype MTBDR-plus assay showed 86.4% and 100% sensitivity and 98.1% and 97.8% specificity for determining INH and RMP sensitivity, respectively, in newly diagnosed patients and 85.7% and 94.4% sensitivity and specificity, respectively, for both INH and RMP in follow-up patients. Conclusion Molecular-based methods are promising techniques for the diagnosis and susceptibility testing of PTB when the ease of sample collection and the speed of diagnosis are taken into consideration. However, they are not as useful for assessing follow-up patients.

10.1016_j.ijid.2016.08.027	Interactions of linezolid and second-line anti-tuberculosis agents against multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro and in vivo	Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the interactions between linezolid (LZD) and second-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) agents in susceptible and multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB in vitro, and to validate the in vitro results in a murine TB model. Methods: The minimum inhibitory concentrations of LZD and seven second-line anti-TB drugs against H37Rv and three multidrug-resistant clinical isolates were determined by Alamar Blue assay, and the interaction patterns of LZD and the seven second-line anti-TB agents against the four isolates were studied using a dynamic checkerboard method. The activities of these combinations against Mycobacterium tuberculosis were evaluated in a murine model of TB. Results: The combination of LZD + capreomycin exhibited partial synergism for three of four isolates, LZD + para-aminosalicylic acid exhibited partial synergism for two of four isolates, and LZD + levofloxacin and LZD + amikacin exhibited partial synergism for one of four isolates; all other combinations showed indifference or an additive effect in vitro. The activities of six combinations and the standard regimen rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide were investigated in a murine model of TB (infection with H37Rv). Significant reductions in colony-forming units (CFU) were found in LZD + capreomycin and LZD + clofazimine groups when the CFU in the lungs on day 0 (the day of beginning treatment) was compared with the CFU in the lungs after 2 months of treatment. Conclusions: These combinations of LZD and second-line anti-TB drugs were all active against MDR-TB with indifference or an additive effect, except LZD + capreomycin, which showed partial synergy.

10.1128_AAC.00632_16	Pyrazinamide Resistance Assays and Two-Month Sputum Culture Status in Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	"Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing is the current ""gold standard"" for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis susceptibility to antituberculous drugs. Pyrazinamide is one antituberculous drug for which the correlation between in vitro resistance and clinical outcomes remains unclear. Here we performed latent class analysis (LCA) to develop a consensus gold standard definition of pyrazinamide resistance using three paired standard pyrazinamide resistance assays. We then compared this consensus measure to the 2-month culture results for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) who were treated for 2 months with first-line antituberculous drugs before their resistance results were known. Among 121 patients with MDR-TB, 60 (49.6%) were resistant to pyrazinamide by the Wayne method (L. G. Wayne, Am Rev Respir Dis 109: 147-151, 1974), 71 (58.7%) were resistant by the Bactec MGIT 960 method, and 68 (56.2%) were resistant by pncA sequencing. LCA grouped isolates with positive results by at least two assays into a category which we considered the ""consensus gold standard"" for pyrazinamide resistance. The sensitivity and specificity for this consensus gold standard were 82.4% and 92.5%, respectively, for the Wayne method; 95.6% and 88.7%, respectively, for the Bactec MGIT 960 method; and 92.6% and 90.6%, respectively, for pncA sequencing. After we adjusted for other factors associated with poor outcomes, including age, sex, alcohol use, and baseline ethambutol resistance, patients whose isolates were resistant by the LCA-derived consensus gold standard were more likely to be culture positive at 2 months with an odds ratio of 1.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.74 to 5.11), but this result was not statistically significant. These findings underscore the need for improved diagnostics for routine use in programmatic settings."

10.3349_ymj.2016.57.6.1508	Is Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis More Prevalent in HIV-Infected Patients in Korea?	The epidemiological synergy between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) is a major threat to public health. However, the association between HIV and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is not clear. To explore the association between HIV and MDR-TB infection, a case-control study was performed in Korea. A total of 1606 culture-proven TB patients (45 HIV vs. 1561 non-HIV) from January 2006 to October 2014 were included in this analysis. MDR-TB rates were 11.1% and 8.2% in the HIV and non-HIV groups, respectively (p=0.42), thus indicating that MDR-TB was not significantly associated with HIV infection in Korea.

10.1007_s40261_016_0443_6	Comparison of Effectiveness Between Delamanid and Bedaquiline Among Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis: A Markov Model Simulation Study	No clear evidence on the comparative effectiveness of delamanid (DLM) and bedaquiline (BDQ) has been published. This study aims to estimate the incremental effectiveness of DLM versus BDQ in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). We developed a Markov model based on a cohort with MDR-TB, which consisted of success, failure, loss to follow-up, and death. The cohort simulation was conducted assuming each patient was 36 years old and, lived until age 82, and that the cycle length was 1 year. Patients with an inadequate response to DLM, the background regimen, or BDQ for 2 years were transitioned through the next treatment sequence. We evaluated the incremental effectiveness of the drugs using the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) resulting from this Markov model over a lifetime. The incremental effectiveness of DLM (13.96 QALYs) was greater by 2.44 QALYs per patient than the background regimen (11.52 QALY), while the incremental effectiveness of BDQ (10.40 QALY) was higher by 1.14 QALY per patient than the background regimen (9.26 QALY). Consequently, the incremental effectiveness of DLM was relatively more positive by 1.30 QALY than those of BDQ per patient over a lifetime. This study is a simulation study. Therefore, the treatment sequence for patients may be different in the real world. Our lifetime simulated data found that DLM was relatively more favorable than BDQ. A Markov model can be considered an alternative approach when there is an absence of head-to-head clinical data.		COST-EFFECTIVENESS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; OUTCOMES; TMC207
10.5588_ijtld.16.0111	Provider perspectives on drug-resistant tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus care in South Africa: a qualitative case study	OBJECTIVE: To examine influences on health care workers' (HCWs') capacity to deliver health care for multi- and/or extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/XDR-TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in South Africa. DESIGN: Qualitative data were collected via group and individual interviews with a purposive sample of 17 HCWs at a centralised, tertiary TB facility and analysed using grounded theory. RESULTS: Four themes were identified: 1) personal infection control practices among HCWs may be weakened by a workplace culture comprising low motivation, disparate risk perceptions and practices across workforce hierarchies, physical discomfort, and problems managing patients with treatment-induced hearing loss. 2) Patient-provider interactions are likely stronger among nurses, and in HIV vs. MDR/XDR-TB service delivery, due to greater attention to patient empowerment and support. Stigma associated with MDR/XDR-TB, considered worse than HIV, may be perpetuated within non-specialised facilities less familiar with MDR/XDR-TB. 3) HCWs who struggle with the daily tedium of MDR/XDR-TB treatment supervision are becoming increasingly supportive of treatment literacy and self-administration. 4) Effective integration of REV and MDR/XDR-TB services may be impeded by administrative restrictions, workplace norms and provider mindsets. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive, decentralised management of MDR/XDR-TB and HIV coinfection requires the creation of patient-provider trust and treatment literacy in MDR/XDR-TB programmes, and defying workplace norms that could provoke nosocomial TB exposure and fragmented service provision.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis; TB-HIV coinfection; health care workers; health service delivery; qualitative methods	HEALTH-CARE; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; INFECTION-CONTROL; TB PATIENTS; MDR-TB; XDR-TB; WORKERS; HIV; METAANALYSIS; ADHERENCE
10.5588_ijtld.16.0033	Endobronchial valve treatment of destructive multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	BACKGROUND: In accordance with the existing hypothesis, the application of an endobronchial valve (EbV) leads to selective curative atelectasis of the affected part of the lung, contributing to early closure of cavities. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of EbV treatment on the course of tuberculosis (TB). METHODS: We compared the efficacy of EbV treatment and complex second-line treatment in treating patients with destructive pulmonary multidrug-resistant. TB (MDR-TB). Bacteriological conversion and closure of cavities were selected as criteria to assess the effectiveness of EbV application. A total of 102 patients with destructive MDR-TB were enrolled into the study and randomly divided into two groups: 49 patients had an EbV installed (intervention group) and 53 patients received complex second-line treatment (control group). Complex chemotherapy was administered to both groups throughout the study period. RESULTS: The cure rate in the short- and long-term follow-up periods in the intervention group was shown to be much higher, 95.9% by bacteriological conversion and 67.3% by cavity closure. On comparison with the control group, this was respectively 37.7% and 20.7% (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The application of EbV treatment can significantly improve the effectiveness of second-line chemotherapy regimens in MDR-TB patients.	non-pharmacological treatment of TB; EbV; anti-tuberculosis treatment; bronchoscopy	LUNG-VOLUME REDUCTION; PLACEMENT
10.1039_c6ob01893a	New synthetic approaches towards analogues of bedaquiline	Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is of growing global concern and threatens to undermine increasing efforts to control the worldwide spread of tuberculosis (TB). Bedaquiline has recently emerged as a new drug developed to specifically treat MDR-TB. Despite being highly effective as a result of its unique mode of action, bedaquiline has been associated with significant toxicities and as such, safety concerns are limiting its clinical use. In order to access pharmaceutical agents that exhibit an improved safety profile for the treatment of MDR-TB, new synthetic pathways to facilitate the preparation of bedaquiline and analogues thereof have been discovered.

10.1186_s12879_016_1920_5	Drug susceptibility profiles of pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from patients in informal urban settlements in Nairobi, Kenya	Background: Anti-tuberculosis drug resistance is an emerging health problem in Kenya and especially in slums. Slum environments create a conducive environment for the spread of tuberculosis (TB) due to high population density and lack of basic amenities such as decent housing, access to clean water, lack of drainage and basic sanitation. Furthermore, ineffective health services in crowded and poorer populations, poor patient compliance, a large pool of untreated cases, delayed diagnosis and inappropriate treatment regimens are likely to favour selection and spread of drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains in such settings, however, precise data on this problem are only sparsely available. To address this question, this study aimed at determining drug resistance patterns of Mtb strains obtained from pulmonary TB patients who sought health care in randomly selected informal settings. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted between September 2014 and March 2015, sputum samples were collected from 223 consenting adult patients and subjected to primary isolation and drug susceptibility testing. Socio-demographic data was collected and all data analysed using SPSS v20. Results: Drug susceptibility testing against first line drugs was successfully carried out on 184 isolates. Resistance to at-least one drug was observed in 33 % of the isolates. The highest prevalence of resistance to any drug was identified against isoniazid,(INH) (23.9 %) followed by Ethambutol (EMB) (13.6 %). The highest proportion of mono resistance was observed against INH, 25 (13.6 %). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was observed in 4.4 % of the new cases. There was no significant difference in the proportion of any resistance by sex, age or previous treatment. Conclusion: Levels of drug resistance have reached an alarming level in this population. Capacity of laboratories to conduct TB culture and DST should be strengthened in order to adequately manage TB patients and stop further creation and spread of MDR TB.

10.1371_journal.pone.0163994	Prevalence of Drug Resistance Mycobacterium Tuberculosis among Patients Seen in Coast Provincial General Hospital, Mombasa, Kenya	Background Although prevention and control of spread of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis strains is a global challenge, there is paucity of data on the prevalence of DR-TB in patients diagnosed with TB in referral hospitals in Kenya. The present study assessed patients' characteristics and prevalence of drug resistant TB in sputa smear positive TB patients presenting to Coast Provincial General Hospital (CPGH) in Mombasa, Kenya. Methods Drug resistance was evaluated in 258 randomly selected sputa smear TB positive cases between the periods of November 2011 to February 2012 at the CPGH-Mombasa. Basic demographic data was obtained using administered questionnaires, and clinical history extracted from the files. For laboratory analyses, 2mls of sputum was obtained, decontaminated and subjected to mycobacteria DNA analyses. Detection of first line drug resistance genes was done using MDRTDR plus kit. This was followed with random selection of 83 cases for second line drug resistance genes testing using Genotype MDRTBsl probe assay kit (HAINS Lifesciences, GmbH, Germany), in which ethambutol mutation probes were included. The data was then analyzed using SPSS statistical package version 19.0. Results Male to female ratio was 1:2. Age range was 9 to 75 years, with median of 30 years. New treatment cases constituted 253(98%), among which seven turned out to be PTB negative, and further grouped as 4 (1.6%) PTB negative and 3(1.1%) NTM. 237(91.7%) new cases were fully susceptible to INH and RIF. The remaining, 8 (3.1%) and 1(0.4%) had mono-resistance to INH and RIF, respectively. All the retreatment cases were fully susceptible to the first line drugs. HIV positivity was found in 48 (18.6%) cases, of which 46(17.8%) were co-infected with TB. Of these, 44 (17.1%) showed full susceptibility to TB drugs, while 2 (0.8%) were INH resistant. For the second line drugs, one case each showed mono resistance to both and FQ. Also, one case each showed drug cross poly resistance to both ETH and FQ, with second line injectable antibiotics. However, no significant statistical correlation was established between TB and resistance to the second line drugs p = 0.855. Conclusion The findings of this study showed the existence of resistance to both first and second line anti-tubercular drugs, but no MDR-TB and XDR-TB was detected among patients attending TB clinic at CPGH using molecular techniques.

10.1128_AAC.00961_16	Amikacin Optimal Exposure Targets in the Hollow-Fiber System Model of Tuberculosis	Aminoglycosides such as amikacin are currently used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). However, formal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies to identify amikacin exposures and dosing schedules that optimize Mycobacterium tuberculosis killing have not been performed. It is believed that aminoglycosides do not work well under acidic conditions, which, if true, would mean poor sterilizing activity against semidormant bacilli at low pH. We performed time-kill studies to compare the bactericidal effect of amikacin in log-phase-growth bacilli with the sterilizing effect in semidormant bacilli at pH 5.8 in broth. In log-phase M. tuberculosis at normal pH versus semidormant M. tuberculosis at pH 5.8, the maximal kill (E-max) estimate and 95% confidence interval (CI) were 5.39 (95% CI, 4.91 to 5.63) versus 4.88 (CI, 4.46 to 5.22) log10 CFU/ml, while the concentration mediating 50% of E-max (EC50) was 1.0 (CI, 0. 0.86 to 1.12) versus 0.60 (CI, 0.50 to 0.66) times the MIC, respectively. Thus, the optimal exposures and kill rates identified for log-phase M. tuberculosis will be optimal even for semidormant bacilli. Next, we performed exposure-response and dose-scheduling studies in the hollow-fiber system model of tuberculosis using log-phase M. tuberculosis. We recapitulated the amikacin concentration-time profiles observed in lungs of patients treated over 28 days. The PK/PD index linked to M. tuberculosis kill was the peak concentration (C-max)-to-MIC ratio (r(2)> 0.99), closely followed by the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC(0-24))-to-MIC ratio (r(2) > 0.98). The EC90 was a C-max/MIC ratio of 10.13 (95% CI, 7.73 to 12.48). The EC90 is the dosing target for intermittent therapy that optimizes cure in TB programs for MDR-TB patients.

10.1128_AAC.00962_16	Artificial Intelligence and Amikacin Exposures Predictive of Outcomes in Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients	Aminoglycosides such as amikacin continue to be part of the backbone of treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). We measured amikacin concentrations in 28 MDR-TB patients in Botswana receiving amikacin therapy together with oral levofloxacin, ethionamide, cycloserine, and pyrazinamide and calculated areas under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 24 h (AUC(0-24)). The patients were followed monthly for sputum culture conversion based on liquid cultures. The median duration of amikacin therapy was 184 (range, 28 to 866) days, at a median dose of 17.30 (range 11.11 to 19.23) mg/kg. Only 11 (39%) patients had sputum culture conversion during treatment; the rest failed. We utilized classification and regression tree analyses (CART) to examine all potential predictors of failure, including clinical and demographic features, comorbidities, and amikacin peak concentrations (C-max), AUC(0-24), and trough concentrations. The primary node for failure had two competing variables, C-max of < 67 mg/liter and AUC(0-24) of< 568.30 mg.h/L; weight of>41 kg was a secondary node with a score of 35% relative to the primary node. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the CART model was an R-2 = 0.90 on posttest. In patients weighing> 41 kg, sputum conversion was 3/3 (100%) in those with an amikacin C-max of >= 67 mg/liter versus 3/15 (20%) in those with a C-max of< 67 mg/liter (relative risk [RR] = 5.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.82 to 13.76). In all patients who had both amikacin C-max and AUC(0-24) below the threshold, 7/7 (100%) failed, compared to 7/15 (47%) of those who had these parameters above threshold (RR = 2.14; 95% CI, 1.25 to 43.68). These amikacin dose-schedule patterns and exposures are virtually the same as those identified in the hollow-fiber system model.

10.1183_13993003.00462_2016	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment failure detection depends on monitoring interval and microbiological method	Debate persists about monitoring method (culture or smear) and interval (monthly or less frequently) during treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). We analysed existing data and estimated the effect of monitoring strategies on timing of failure detection. We identified studies reporting microbiological response to MDR-TB treatment and solicited individual patient data from authors. Frailty survival models were used to estimate pooled relative risk of failure detection in the last 12 months of treatment; hazard of failure using monthly culture was the reference. Data were obtained for 5410 patients across 12 observational studies. During the last 12 months of treatment, failure detection occurred in a median of 3 months by monthly culture; failure detection was delayed by 2, 7, and 9 months relying on bimonthly culture, monthly smear and bimonthly smear, respectively. Risk (95% CI) of failure detection delay resulting from monthly smear relative to culture is 0.38 (0.34-0.42) for all patients and 0.33 (0.25-0.42) for HIV-co-infected patients. Failure detection is delayed by reducing the sensitivity and frequency of the monitoring method. Monthly monitoring of sputum cultures from patients receiving MDR-TB treatment is recommended. Expanded laboratory capacity is needed for high-quality culture, and for smear microscopy and rapid molecular tests.

10.1371_journal.pmed.1002142	Tradeoffs in Introduction Policies for the Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Bedaquiline: A Model-Based Analysis	Background New drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) are becoming available for the first time in over 40 y. Optimal strategies for introducing these drugs have not yet been established. The objective of this study was to compare different strategies for introducing the new TB drug bedaquiline based on patients' resistance patterns. Methods and Findings We created a Markov decision model to follow a hypothetical cohort of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB patients under different bedaquiline use strategies. The explored strategies included making bedaquiline available to all patients with MDR TB, restricting bedaquiline usage to patients with MDR plus additional resistance and withholding bedaquiline introduction completely. We compared these strategies according to life expectancy, risks of acquired resistance, and the expected number and health outcomes of secondary cases. For our simulated cohort, the mean (2.5th, 97.5th percentile) life expectancy from time of initiation of MDR TB treatment at age 30 was 36.0 y (33.5, 38.7) assuming all patients with MDR TB received bedaquiline, 35.1 y (34.4, 35.8) assuming patients with pre-extensively drug-resistant (PreXDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB received bedaquiline, and 34.9 y (34.6, 35.2) assuming only patients with XDR TB received bedaquiline. Although providing bedaquiline to all MDR patients resulted in the highest life expectancy for our initial cohort averaged across all parameter sets, for parameter sets in which bedaquiline conferred high risks of added mortality and only small reductions in median time to culture conversion, the optimal strategy would be to withhold use even from patients with the most extensive resistance. Across all parameter sets, the most liberal bedaquiline use strategies consistently increased the risk of bedaquiline resistance but decreased the risk of resistance to other MDR drugs. In almost all cases, more liberal bedaquiline use strategies reduced the expected number of secondary cases and resulting life years lost. The generalizability of our results is limited by the lack of available data about drug effects among individuals with HIV co-infection, drug interactions, and other sources of heterogeneity, as well as changing recommendations for MDR TB treatment. Conclusions If mortality benefits can be empirically verified, our results provide support for expanding bedaquiline access to all patients with MDR TB. Such expansion could improve patients' health, protect background MDR TB drugs, and decrease transmission, but would likely result in greater resistance to bedaquiline.

10.1016_j.rmed.2016.08.009	Tuberculosis. Digging deep in the soul of humanity	Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the oldest infectious diseases that affected humankind. A quintessential social disease, TB remains one of the world's deadliest communicable diseases, with still a high mortality and burden of disease. Social representations of TB focus on aspects associated to feelings and manifestations awakened by the disease, sometimes reinforcing stigmas and prejudices about the way of perceiving TB. TB is a historic disease now reborn with a deeper social stigma. Despite the modest reduction in TB incidence worldwide, its incidence is still rising in certain crisis-affected populations like refugees, and in those bearing high prevalence of HIV, persisting poverty, especially in the developing world. Fear and stigma may appear justified with the increasing rates of multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB, and now extremely drug resistant (XDR) TB. However, stigmatization of TB poses serious obstacles to current TB control efforts, as socio-cultural aspects can influence adherence to TB treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.5588_ijtld.16.0199	High correlation of clinical criteria in the diagnosis of drug-resistant TB and prevalence of ofloxacin resistance	OBJECTIVE:To study the drug resistance profile of patients with suspected multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective study conducted among patients with suspected MDR TB attending the Department of Respiratory Medicine, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India, from August 2014 to April 2015. Sputum samples obtained from 50 such patients were subjected to drug susceptibility testing against first- and second-line drugs. Data on baseline characteristics were obtained from the patients and their previous medical records. RESULTS: Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected in 47/50 (94%) and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in 3/50 (6%). Of the 47 patients with M. tuberculosis, 36 (76.6%) had MDR-TB: 24 (66.7%) of these had pre extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR-TB) and 4 (11.1%) had XDR-TB. CONCLUSIONs: Among proven MDR-TB cases, approximately two thirds were pre-XDR-TB cases and more than 10% were XDR-TB cases. These form a sizeable proportion and may result in the failure of second-line treatment.

10.5588_ijtld.16.0081	Comparing laboratory costs of smear/culture and Xpert (R) MTB/RIF-based tuberculosis diagnostic algorithms	SETTING: Cape Town, South Africa, where Xpert (R) MTB/RIF was introduced as a screening test for all presumptive tuberculosis (TB) cases. OBJECTIVE : To compare laboratory costs of smear/culture- and Xpert-based tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic algorithms in routine operational conditions. METHODs: Economic costing was undertaken from a laboratory perspective, using an ingredients-based costing approach. Cost allocation was based on reviews of standard operating procedures and laboratory records, timing of test procedures, measurement of laboratory areas and manager interviews. We analysed laboratory test data to assess overall costs and cost per pulmonary TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) case diagnosed. Costs were expressed as 2013 Consumer Price Index-adjusted values. RESULTS : Total TB diagnostic costs increased by 43%, from US$440 967 in the smear/culture-based algorithm (April-June 2011) to US$632 262 in the Xpert-based algorithm (April-June 2013). The cost per TB case diagnosed increased by 157%, from US$48.77 (n = 1601) to US$125.32 (n = 1281). The total cost per MDR-TB case diagnosed was similar, at US$190.14 and US$183.86, with 95 and 107 cases diagnosed in the respective algorithms. CONCLUSION: The introduction of the Xpert-based algorithm resulted in substantial cost increases. This was not matched by the expected increase in TB diagnostic efficacy, calling into question the sustainability of this expensive new technology.

10.1007_s11095_016_1974_5	Inhaled Pyrazinoic Acid Esters for the Treatment of Tuberculosis	Analog development of existing drugs and direct drug delivery to the lungs by inhalation as treatments for multiple and extensively drug resistant (MDR and XDR) tuberculosis (TB) represent new therapeutic strategies. Pyrazinamide (PZA) is critical to drug sensitive TB therapy and is included in regimens for MDR TB. However, PZA-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains threaten its use. Pyrazinoic acid esters (PAEs) are PZA analogs effective against Mtb in vitro, including against the most common PZA resistant strains. However, PAEs require testing for TB efficacy in animal models. PAEs were delivered daily as aqueous dispersions from a vibrating mesh nebulizer to Mtb infected guinea pigs for 4 weeks in a regimen including orally administered first-line TB drugs. PAEs tested as a supplement to oral therapy significantly reduced the organ bacterial burden in comparison to infected, untreated control animals. Thus, PAE aerosol therapy is a potentially significant addition to the regimen for PZA resistant MDR-TB and XDR-TB treatment. Interestingly, low dose oral PZA treatment combined with standard therapy also reduced bacterial burden. This observation may be important for PZA susceptible disease treatment. The present study justifies further evaluation of PZA analogs and their lung delivery to treat TB.	inhaled therapy; pyrazinoic acid; pyrazinoic acid esters; TB drugs; tuberculosis	RESISTANT MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; VITRO ANTIMYCOBACTERIAL ACTIVITY; GUINEA-PIG MODEL; IN-VITRO; PYRAZINAMIDE RESISTANCE; ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS; STERILIZING ACTIVITY; INFECTION; SUSCEPTIBILITY; THERAPY
10.1186_s12879_016_1848_9	Persistently high prevalence of primary resistance and multidrug resistance of tuberculosis in Heilongjiang Province, China	Background: The spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) strains has been a big challenge to the TB control and prevention in China. Knowledge about patterns of drug resistance in TB high-burden areas of China is crucial to develop appropriate control strategies. We conducted a comprehensive investigation of the resistance pattern of M. tuberculosis in Heilongjiang Province. Methods: 1427 M. tuberculosis clinical strains were isolated from pulmonary TB patients hospitalized between 2007 and 2012. The susceptibility of the isolates to the first-line anti-TB drugs and the resistance of MDR M. tuberculosis to fluoroquinolones were examined. We also performed a statistical analysis to identify the correlated risk factors for high burden of MDR-TB. Results: The global resistance rates of 2007-2012 to the first-line drugs and MDR were 57.0 and 22.8 %, respectively. Notably, the primary MDR-TB and pan-resistance rates were as high as 13.6 and 5.0 %, respectively. Of MDR M. tuberculosis isolates (2009), approximately 13 % were not susceptible to any of the fluoroquinolones tested. Being age of 35 to 54, high re-treatment proportion, the presence of cavity lesion, and high proportion of shorter hospitalization are correlated with the development of MDR-TB. Conclusions: The high prevalence of drug resistant, MDR-TB, and fluoroquinolone-resistant MDR-TB is a big concern for TB control. More importantly, in order to control the development of MDR-TB effectively, we need to pay more attention to the primary resistance. Targeting reducing the prevalence of the risk factors may lead to better TB control in China.

10.1038_srep32725	Bis-biguanide dihydrochloride inhibits intracellular replication of M-tuberculosis and controls infection in mice	While there is an urgent need to develop new and effective drugs for treatment of tuberculosis (TB) and multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), repurposing FDA (U. S. Food and Drug Administration) -approved drugs for development of anti-TB agents may decrease time and effort from bench to bedside. Here, we employed host cell-based high throughput screening (HTS) assay to screen and characterize FDAapproved, off-patent library drugs for anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) activities. The cell-based HTS allowed us to identify an anti-cancer drug of bis-biguanide dihydrochloride (BBD) as potent anti-mycobacteria agent. Further characterization showed that BBD could inhibit intracellular and extracellular growth of M. smegmatis and slow-growing M. bovis BCG. BBD also potently inhibited replication of clinically-isolated MTB and MDR-TB strains. The proof-of-concept study showed that BBD treatment of MTB-infected mice could significantly decrease CFU counts in the lung and spleen. Notably, comparative evaluation showed that MTB CFU counts in BBD-treated mice were lower than those in rifampicin-treated mice. No apparent BBD side effects were found in BBD-treated mice. Thus, our findings support further studies to develop BBD as a new and effective drug against TB and MDR-TB.		SYSTEM; ENTRY; CELLS; A549
10.1186_s12879_016_1802_x	The socioeconomic impact of multidrug resistant tuberculosis on patients: results from Ethiopia, Indonesia and Kazakhstan	Background: One of the main goals of the post-2015 global tuberculosis (TB) strategy is that no families affected by TB face catastrophic costs. We revised an existing TB patient cost measurement tool to specifically also measure multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB patients' costs and applied it in Ethiopia, Indonesia and Kazakhstan. Methods: Through structured interviews with TB and MDR-TB patients in different stages of treatment, we collected data on the direct (out of pocket) and indirect (loss of income) costs of patients and their families related to the diagnosis and treatment of TB and MDR-TB. Direct costs included costs for hospitalization, follow-up tests, transport costs for health care visits, and food supplements. Calculation of indirect costs was based on time needed for diagnosis and treatment. Costs were extrapolated over the patient's total treatment phase. Results: In total 406 MDR-TB patients and 197 other TB patients were included in the survey: 169 MDR-TB patients and 25 other TB patients in Ethiopia; 143 MDR-TB patients and 118 TB patients in Indonesia; and 94 MDR-TB patients and 54 other TB patients in Kazakhstan. Total costs for diagnosis and current treatment episode for TB patients were estimated to be USD 260 in Ethiopia, USD 169 in Indonesia, and USD 929 in Kazakhstan, compared to USD 1838, USD 2342, and USD 3125 for MDR-TB patients, respectively. These costs represented 0.82-4.6 months of pre-treatment household income for TB patients and 9.3-24.9 months for MDR-TB patients. Importantly, 38-92 % reported income loss and 26-76 % of TB patients lost their jobs due to (MDR) TB illness, further aggravating the financial burden. Conclusions: The financial burden of MDR-TB is alarming, although all TB patients experienced substantial socioeconomic impact of the disease. If the patient is the breadwinner of the family, the combination of lost income and extra costs is generally catastrophic. Therefore, it should be a priority of the government to relieve the financial burden based on the cost mitigation options identified.

10.1128_AAC.02687_15	Multicenter Study of the Emergence and Genetic Characteristics of Pyrazinamide-Resistant Tuberculosis in China	The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of pyrazinamide (PZA) resistance and the associated risk factors as well as to evaluate the pncA gene loci as a marker for PZA resistance in China. A population-based multicenter study of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) cases was carried out from 2011 to 2013 in four Chinese districts/counties with different geographic and socioeconomic features. Testing for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and susceptibility to PZA was done by the proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium and Bactec MGIT 960, respectively. Mutations in the pncA gene were identified by sequencing. Among 878 culture-positive cases, 147 (16.7%) were resistant to PZA, with a significantly higher proportion among MDR isolates than among the first-line drug-susceptible isolates (30.2% versus 7.7%; P< 0.001). In total, 136 isolates had a nonsynonymous pncA mutation, with a comparable diagnostic performance between Beijing family and non-Beijing family as well as between MDR-TB and first-line drug-susceptible TB. Furthermore, the mutations in isolates with high-level PZA resistance (MIC> 500 mg/liter) were observed mainly in three regions of the pncA gene (codons 51 to 76, codons 130 to 142, and codons 163 to 180). Patients with prior treatment history had a significantly higher risk for PZA monoresistance (odds ratio [ OR], 2.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.363 to 6.015) and MDR PZA resistance (OR, 6.47; 95% CI, 3.186 to 13.15), while the additional factors associated with MDR PZA resistance were the patient's age (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.003 to 1.042), lung cavity (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.296 to 5.391). These findings suggest that it is a priority to identify PZA resistance in MDR-TB and that a rapid molecular diagnostic test based on pncA mutations in the Chinese settings where MDR-TB prevalence is high should be developed.

10.1128_AAC.00393_16	Wild-Type and Non-Wild-Type Mycobacterium tuberculosis MIC Distributions for the Novel Fluoroquinolone Antofloxacin Compared with Those for Ofloxacin, Levofloxacin, and Moxifloxacin	Antofloxacin (AFX) is a novel fluoroquinolone that has been approved in China for the treatment of infections caused by a variety of bacterial species. We investigated whether it could be repurposed for the treatment of tuberculosis by studying its in vitro activity. We determined the wild-type and non-wild-type MIC ranges for AFX as well as ofloxacin (OFX), levofloxacin (LFX), and moxifloxacin (MFX), using the microplate alamarBlue assay, of 126 clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains from Beijing, China, of which 48 were OFX resistant on the basis of drug susceptibility testing on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. The MIC distributions were correlated with mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA (Rv0006) and gyrB (Rv0005). Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data for AFX were retrieved from the literature. AFX showed lower MIC levels than OFX but higher MIC levels than LFX and MFX on the basis of the tentative epidemiological cutoff values (ECOFFs) determined in this study. All strains with non-wild-type MICs for AFX harbored known resistance mutations that also resulted in non-wild-type MICs for LFX and MFX. Moreover, our data suggested that the current critical concentration of OFX for Lowenstein-Jensen medium that was recently revised by the World Health Organization might be too high, resulting in the misclassification of phenotypically non-wildtype strains with known resistance mutations as wild type. On the basis of our exploratory PK/PD calculations, the current dose of AFX is unlikely to be optimal for the treatment of tuberculosis, but higher doses could be effective.

10.1093_trstmh_trw060	Impact of rapid molecular diagnostic tests on time to treatment initiation and outcomes in patients with multidrug-resistant TB, Tamil Nadu, India	Background: India is replacing culture and drug sensitivity testing (CDST) with rapid molecular tests for diagnosing multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). We assessed the impact of rapid tests on time to initiation of treatment and outcomes in patients with MDR-TB compared with CDST. Methods: A retrospective cohort study involving MDR-TB patients from six districts in Tamil Nadu state, who underwent CDST (2010-2011) and rapid tests (2012-2013). Results: There were 135 patients in the CDST group and 389 in the rapid diagnostic test group. Median time from sputum receipt at the laboratory to initiation of MDR-TB treatment was 130 days (IQR 75-213) in the CDST group and 22 days (IQR 14-38) in the rapid diagnostic test group (p<0.001). Overall treatment success was 30% with CDST and 41% with rapid tests (p<0.05), but there was high loss to follow-up >30% in both groups and missing data were higher in CDST (13%) compared with rapid tests (3%). There were significantly higher risks of unfavourable treatment outcomes in males (aRR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5) and those with treatment initiation delays >30 days (aRR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.6). Conclusion: Rapid molecular diagnostic tests shortened the time to initiate treatment which was associated with reduced unfavourable outcomes in MDR-TB patients. This supports the policy to scale up these tests in India.

10.1111_jcmm.12867	Identification of HLA-A*11:01-restricted Mycobacterium tuberculosis CD8(+) T cell epitopes	New vaccines are needed to combat Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infections. The currently employed Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine is becoming ineffective, due in part to the emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains and the reduced immune capacity in cases of HIV coinfection. CD8(+) T cells play an important role in the protective immunity against MTB infections, and the identification of immunogenic CD8(+) T cell epitopes specific for MTB is essential for the design of peptide-based vaccines. To identify CD8(+) T cell epitopes of MTB proteins, we screened a set of 94 MTB antigens for HLA class I A*11:01-binding motifs. HLA-A*11:01 is one of the most prevalent HLA molecules in Southeast Asians, and definition of T cell epitopes it can restrict would provide significant coverage for the Asian population. Peptides that bound with high affinity to purified HLA molecules were subsequently evaluated in functional assays to detect interferon- release and CD8(+) T cell proliferation in active pulmonary TB patients. We identified six novel epitopes, each derived from a unique MTB antigen, which were recognized by CD8(+) T cells from active pulmonary TB patients. In addition, a significant level of epitope-specific T cells could be detected ex vivo in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from active TB patients by an HLA-A*11:01 dextramer carrying the peptide Rv3130c(194-204) (from the MTB triacylglycerol synthase Tgs1), which was the most frequently recognized epitope in our peptide library. In conclusion, this study identified six dominant CD8(+) T cell epitopes that may be considered potential targets for subunit vaccines or diagnostic strategies against TB.

10.1128_JCM.00670_16	Sequence Analysis of Fluoroquinolone Resistance-Associated Genes gyrA and gyrB in Clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates from Patients Suspected of Having Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in New Delhi, India	Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are broad-spectrum antibiotics recommended for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients. FQ resistance, caused by mutations in the gyrA and gyrB genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is increasingly reported worldwide; however, information on mutations occurring in strains from the Indian subcontinent is scarce. Hence, in this study, we aimed to characterize mutations in the gyrA and gyrB genes of acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear-positive sediments or of M. tuberculosis isolates from AFB smear-negative samples from patients in India suspected of having MDR-TB. A total of 152 samples from patients suspected of having MDR-TB were included in the study. One hundred forty-six strains detected in these samples were characterized by sequencing of the gyrA and gyrB genes. The extracted DNA was subjected to successive amplifications using a nested PCR protocol, followed by sequencing. A total of 27 mutations were observed in the gyrA genes of 25 strains, while no mutations were observed in the gyrB genes. The most common mutations occurred at amino acid position 94 (13/27 [48.1%]); of these, the D94G mutation was the most prevalent. The gyrA mutations were significantly associated with patients with rifampin (RIF)-resistant TB. Heterozygosity was seen in 4/27 (14.8%) mutations, suggesting the occurrence of mixed populations with different antimicrobial susceptibilities. A high rate of FQ-resistant mutations (17.1%) was obtained among the isolates of TB patients suspected of having MDR-TB. These observations emphasize the need for accurate and rapid molecular tests for the detection of FQ-resistant mutations at the time of MDR-TB diagnosis.

10.1097_QAI.0000000000001110	Clinical Impact of the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay in Patients With Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Background:The Xpert MTB/RIF assay has been widely implemented in South Africa for rapid tuberculosis (TB) screening. However, its usefulness in management and improving treatment outcomes in patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) remains undefined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical impact of introduction of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay in patients with MDR-TB.Methods:We enrolled 921 patients with MDR-TB, who presented to a specialist drug-resistant TB facility in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, pre- and post-rollout and implementation of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Clinical, laboratory, chest radiograph, and follow-up data from 108 patients with MDR-TB, post-introduction of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert group) in November 2010, were analyzed and compared with data from 813 MDR-TB patients from the pre-MTB/RIF assay period (Conventional group), July 2008-2010. Primary impact measure was treatment success (World Health Organization definition) at 24 months. Secondary outcomes were time to treatment initiation and disease morbidity.Results:There were no significant differences in treatment success rates between the pre-Xpert MTB/RIF and post-Xpert MTB/RIF groups (54% versus 56.5%, P = 0.681). Median time to treatment initiation was 20 days (interquartile range, 13-31) in the Xpert group versus 92 days (interquartile range, 69-120) in the Conventional group (P < 0.001).Conclusions:Although use of Xpert MTB/RIF assay significantly reduces the time to initiation of MDR-TB treatment, it had no significant impact on treatment outcomes of patients with MDR-TB. Studies on the impact of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay usage on transmission of MDR-TB are required.

10.1093_jac_dkw169	Description of compensatory gyrA mutations restoring fluoroquinolone susceptibility in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQs) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is mainly due to mutations in DNA gyrase (GyrA(2)B(2)), with the most common substitutions located at positions 90 and 94 in GyrA. Two clinical MDR Mtb (MDR-TB) strains harbouring an A90E or D94N substitution in GyrA were found to be surprisingly susceptible to FQs (ofloxacin MIC a parts per thousand currency sign2 mg/L). We studied the impact of the additional GyrA substitutions found in these strains (T80A and T80AaEuroS+aEuroSA90G, respectively) on FQ susceptibility. Mutants of interest were generated by site-specific mutagenesis of GyrA alleles. WT and mutant TB DNA gyrase subunits were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified, and the in vitro susceptibility to FQs of their DNA supercoiling reaction was studied. IC(50)s of mutant gyrase complexes bearing GyrA D94N and A90E were 3- to 36-fold higher than WT IC(50)s, whereas IC(50)s of gyrase bearing T80AaEuroS+aEuroSA90GaEuroS+aEuroSD94N and T80AaEuroS+aEuroSA90E were close to the WT IC(50)s. We demonstrated that substitutions T80A and A90G restore FQ susceptibility when associated with a substitution implicated in high-level FQ resistance. Line probe assay misclassification of MDR-TB strains as pre-XDR or XDR can be corrected by sequence analysis of gyrA.		DNA GYRASE; RESISTANCE
pub-0283	Fermentation, isolation, purification and characterization of an antitubercular antibiotic from Streptomyces luridus MTCC 4402	Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, continues to be a serious public health problem around the world. There is a need for development of new antitubercular drugs. An antibiotic producing strain, Streptomyces luridus (MTCC 4402) was earlier isolated from soil by our group. In this work, the phylogenic status was established by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The strain was foUnd to be active against clinically resistant strains. The culture was grown in shake flasks in a medium containing cornsteep liquor, glucose, CaCO3, soyabean meal and starch. Antibiotic production reached maximum at the end of 72 h. and fermentation profile was obtained. The active compound was extracted into ethyl acetate and was subjected to activity guided purification by column chromatography using silica gel, TLC and HPLC methods. The pure compound eluted at 16.7 min. by gradient elution was subjected to H-1, C-13 NMR and mass spectral analyses. The acquired data was compared with that of natural products' data base and found to be a known antibiotic, spiramycin. The purified compound was studied for mutagenic, cytotoxicity, antitubercular activities. It was non mutagenic at the concentration of 1000 mu g/mL, non cytotoxic and active as antitubercular agent at a concentration of 64 mu g/mL and was comparable to rifampicin.	16S rRNA gene; Antibiotic resistance; Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB); Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Spiramycin; Tuberculosis	BIOLOGICAL-ACTIVITIES; SPIRAMYCIN; TAXONOMY; STRAIN; PHARMACOKINETICS; SOIL
10.1016_j.apjtm.2016.07.017	Screening outcomes of household contacts of multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients in Peshawar, Pakistan	Objective: To assess the profile of TB/multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) among household contacts of MDR-TB patients. Methods: Close contacts of MDR-TB patients were traced in the cross-sectional study. Different clinical, radiological and bacteriological were performed to rule out the evidence of TB/MDR-TB. Results: Between January 2012 and December 2012, a total of 200 index MDR-TB patients were initiated on MDR-TB treatment, out of which home visit and contacts screening were conducted for 154 index cases. Of 610 contacts who could be studied, 41 (17.4%) were diagnosed with MDR-TB and 10 (4.2%) had TB. The most common symptoms observed were cough, chest pain and fever. Conclusions: The high incidence of MDR-TB among close contacts emphasize the need for effective contact screening programme of index MDR-TB cases in order to cut the chain of transmission of this disease.

10.1016_j.jgar.2016.04.005	Predictors of death among drug-resistant tuberculosis patients in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia: A retrospective cohort study from 2009 to 2013	The emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health threat. However, little is known about the predictors of death in drug-resistant TB in Malaysia. This study aimed to determine the predictors of death in drug-resistant TB patients, including multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This study adopted a retrospective cohort study design and involved laboratory-confirmed drug-resistant TB patients (n = 426) from January 2009 to June 2013. A Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to model the outcome measure. Data were analysed by using SPSS v.20.0 for Windows. In this study, 15.3% (n = 65) of the patients died. Among the study patients, 70.9% were monoresistant TB cases, 9.4% were poly-resistant TB and 19.7% were MDR-TB. MDR-TB [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 2.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-3.95], ethnicity [Malay (aHR = 5.95, 95% CI 2.30-15.41), Chinese (aHR = 4.01, 95% CI 1.38-11.66) and Indian (aHR = 3.76, 95% CI 1.19-11.85)], coronary heart disease (aHR = 6.82, 95% CI 2.16-21.50), drug abuse (aHR = 3.79, 95% CI 2.07-6.93) and treatment non-compliance (aHR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.01-3.27) were independent predictors of poorer survival in the multivariate Cox regression analysis. This study suggests that MDR-TB, local ethnicity, coronary heart disease, history of drug abuse and treatment non-compliance are factors predicting poor survival in drug-resistant TB patients. More emphasis should be given to the management of drug-resistant TB patients with these characteristics to achieve better treatment outcomes.

10.1016_j.jgar.2016.04.008	Whole-genome sequencing of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Myanmar	Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is a major health threat in Myanmar. An initial study was conducted to explore the potential utility of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for the diagnosis and management of drug-resistant TB in Myanmar. Fourteen multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were sequenced. Known resistance genes for a total of nine antibiotics commonly used in the treatment of drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in Myanmar were interrogated through WGS. All 14 isolates were MDR-TB, consistent with the results of phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST), and the Beijing lineage predominated. Based on the results of WGS, 9 of the 14 isolates were potentially resistant to at least one of the drugs used in the standard MDR-TB regimen but for which phenotypic DST is not conducted in Myanmar. This study highlights a need for the introduction of second-line DST as part of routine TB diagnosis in Myanmar as well as new classes of TB drugs to construct effective regimens.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0884	Gatifloxacin for short, effective treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	The 9-month regimen for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) piloted in Bangladesh and used, with modifications, in Cameroon and Niger, has achieved treatment success in a very large proportion of patients; gatifloxacin (GFX) is likely to have played a critical role in this success. Two months after the publication of a study reporting that GFX and not moxifloxacin (MFX) was associated with dysglycaemia, the manufacturer announced the withdrawal of GFX from the market. The findings of that study may have less significance for the majority of MDR-TB patients living in high-incidence countries who are much younger, have a lower risk of dysglycaemia and suffer from a highly fatal condition. The problem of dysglycaemia is not limited to GFX use and may occur with SUMMARY other fluoroquinolones; furthermore, GFX-associated dysglycemia was manageable among those MDR-TB patients in Bangladesh and Niger in whom it occurred. GFX has now become unavailable in Bangladesh, Cameroon, Niger and other countries piloting the shorter MDR-TB regimens, depriving resource-poor countries of an efficacious, effective and inexpensive drug with a demonstrated good safety profile for the given indication. There is little reason not to make GFX available for MDR-TB treatment as long as the superiority of non-GFX-based MDR-TB regimens is not demonstrated.

10.5588_ijtld.16.0029	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients lost to follow-up: self reported readiness to restart treatment	SETTING: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients lost to follow-up (LTFU) from Programmatic Management of Drug-resistant Tuberculosis facilities in the Philippines. OBJECTIVES: To gain insight into patients' readiness to return to treatment. METHODS: MDR-TB patients who initiated treatment and were categorized as LTFU were identified using TB registers, contacted, and asked to consent to an interview and medical record review. At the conclusion of the interview, patients' readiness to restart treatment was assessed and examined in relation to demographic, clinical, and interview data. Odds ratios were calculated. RESULTS: When asked if they would consider restarting MDR-TB treatment, 3% of the 89 participating patients reported that they had already restarted, 34% indicated that they wanted to restart, 33% had not considered restarting, 28% were undecided, and 2% had decided against restarting. Patients who wanted to restart treatment were more likely to report having borrowed money for TB-related expenses (OR 5.97, 95 %CI 1.27-28.18), and were less likely to report being self-employed (OR 0.08, 95%CI 0.01-0.67), or perceive themselves at low or no risk for TB relapse (OR 0.30, 95%CI 0.08-0.96) than patients who did not indicate an interest in restarting treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to re-engage LTFU patients in care should consider financial barriers, knowledge gaps, and personal adherence challenges in patients.	patient decision; readiness; health behavior; stages of change; patient education	
10.5588_ijtld.15.0051	Surveillance provides insight into epidemiology and spectrum of culture-confirmed mycobacterial disease in children	BACKGROUND: Longer-term tuberculosis (TB) drug resistance surveillance among children is rare. We determined the prevalence of drug resistance among children with culture-confirmed TB from 2011 to 2013, compared these results with four previous consecutive 2 year periods and documented other mycobacterial isolates identified. METHOD: Surveillance study of mycobacterial culture in all children aged <13 years conducted from March 2011 to February 2013 at the Tygerberg Children's Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. Drug susceptibility testing against isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP) was performed using line-probe assay (GenoType (R) MTBDRplus). Clinical data were obtained through folder review. RESULTS: Of 381 children, 323 (84.8%; 324 episodes) had Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 46 (12.1%) had M. bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin and 12 (3.1%) had non-SUMMARY tuberculous mycobacteria isolated. Forty-one (12.7%) children had M. tuberculosis resistant to INH and/or RMP; 15 (4.7%) had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). The prevalence of INH mono- or polyresistance remained stable; however, RMP monoresistance increased (0/313 in 2003-2005 vs. 6/324, 1.9%, in 2011-2013; P = 0.041); MDR-TB prevalence has declined significantly, from 26/292 (8.9%) in 2007-2009 to 15/324 (4.7%) in 2011-2013 (OR 0.50, 95%CI 0.24-0.99). The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus co-infection has decreased significantly, from a peak of 29% to 15.3%. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a significant reduction in bacteriologically confirmed MDR-TB cases. The increase in RMP monoresistance has important implications for treatment.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; surveillance; children; mycobacteria	DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; WESTERN CAPE PROVINCE; SOUTH-AFRICA; PREVENTIVE THERAPY; CLINICAL-FEATURES; CHILDHOOD; INFANTS; TOWN; BCG
10.1136_thoraxjnl_2015_207638	Survival of patients with multidrug-resistant TB in Eastern Europe: what makes a difference?	Background The quality of care for patients with TB in Eastern Europe has improved significantly; nevertheless drug resistance rates remain high. We analysed survival in a cohort of patients with multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant (MDR-/XDR-) TB from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Bucharest city. Methods Consecutive adult new and retreatment patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary MDR-TB registered for treatment in 2009 (and in 2007 in Latvia) were enrolled; prospective survival information was collected. Results A total of 737 patients were included into the cohort. Of all MDR-TB cases, 46% were newly diagnosed; 56% of all MDR-TB cases had no additional resistance to fluoroquinolones or injectable agents, 33% had pre-XDR-TB and 11% XDR-TB. Median survival was 5.9years in patients with MDR-TB and XDR-TB; 1.9years in patients coinfected with HIV. Older age, male gender, alcohol abuse, retirement, co-morbidities, extrapulmonary involvement and HIV coinfection independently worsened survival. Inclusion of fluoroquinolones and injectable agents improves survival in patients with MDR-TB. Pre-XDR and XDR status did not significantly shorten survival as long as fluoroquinolones and injectable agents were part of the regimen. Moxifloxacin seems to improve survival in ofloxacin-susceptible patients when compared with older generation fluoroquinolones. Conclusions The burden of additional resistances in patients with MDR-TB is high likely due to primary transmission of resistant strains. Social and programmatic factors including management of alcohol dependency, expansion of HIV testing and antiretroviral treatment need to be addressed in order to achieve cure and to interrupt transmission. The role of last generation fluoroquinolones and injectable agents in treatment of patients with pre-XDR and XDR-TB needs to be further investigated.

10.1186_s13756_016_0129_0	Drug susceptibility patterns of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from previously treated and new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis at German-Nepal tuberculosis project laboratory, Kathmandu, Nepal	Background: Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a serious public health problem in Nepal. It is a major obstacle for the control of the tuberculosis. The main objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of the multidrug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis and to evaluate the drug susceptibility patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from previously treated and newly diagnosed cases of pulmonary tuberculosis. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2013 to August 2013 at German-Nepal tuberculosis project (GENETUP) laboratory, Kathmandu, Nepal. For this the sputum samples from total of 153 (49 new and 104 previously treated) suspected pulmonary tuberculosis patients were used. The diagnosis of the tuberculosis was performed by using fluorescent microscopy and culture, while the drug susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was performed by proportion method. Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) medium was used for the culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the colonies grown were identified on the basis of the colony morphology, pigment production and biochemical characteristics. Results: The prevalence of MDR-TB among all the cases of culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis was 15.6 %. The rate of MDR-TB among previously treated culture positive tuberculosis patients was 19.4 % and that among newly diagnosed culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis cases was 7.1 %. The highest rate of resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was toward streptomycin (24.4 %) followed by isoniazid (23 %), rifampicin (17.8 %) and ethambutol (15.6 %). Among the total of MDR-TB cases among previously treated patients, highest percentage of the cases were relapse (61.1 %) followed by chronic (16.7 %). Conclusions: The high prevalence of DR/MDR-TB in our study reflects poor implementation of tuberculosis control program. On the basis of the drug susceptibility patterns of M. tuberculosis we found in our study, we recommend to include ethambutol instead of streptomycin in the multidrug therapy for the treatment of tuberculosis patients in Nepal. Further, due to high rate of MDR-TB among previously treated patients, we do not recommend to use first line drugs for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis among previously treated patients.

10.1186_s12941_016_0165_x	Smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis and associated factors among homeless individuals in Dessie and Debre Birhan towns, Northeast Ethiopia	Background: Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the globe's deadliest communicable diseases. The homeless individuals are at high risk to acquire TB and multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), because of their poor living conditions and risky behaviors. Tuberculosis and MDR-TB in the homeless individuals can pose a risk to entire communities. However, the magnitude of the problem is not known in Ethiopia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and associated factors of smear positive pulmonary TB (PTB) and MDR-TB among homeless individuals in Dessie and Debre Birhan towns, Northeast Ethiopia. Methods: A community based cross-sectional study design was conducted from September 2014 to June 2015. Using an active screening with cough of >= 2 weeks, 351 TB suspects homeless individuals were participated in this study. Data were collected by using pre-tested and structured questionnaire. Spot-morning-spot sputum sample was collected and examined for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) using fluorescence microscopy by Auramine O staining technique. All AFB positive sputum was further analyzed by GeneXpert for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and rifampicin resistant gene. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were applied to identify factors associated with smear positive PTB and P value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: The prevalence of smear positive PTB was 2.6 % (95 % CI 1.3-5) among TB suspect homeless individuals. Extrapolation of this study finding implies that there were 505 smear positive PTB per 100,000 homeless individuals. All smear positive PTB sputum specimens were further analyzed by GeneXpert assay, the assay confirmed that all were positive for MTBC but none were resistant to RIF or MDR. Smoking cigarette regularly for greater than 5 years (AOR 10.1, 95 % CI 1.1, 97.7), body mass index lower than 18.5 (AOR 6.9, 95 % CI 1.12, 41.1) and HIV infection (AOR 6.8, 95 % CI 1.1, 40.1) were significantly associated with smear positive PTB. Conclusion: The prevalence of smear positive PTB among TB suspect homeless individuals was 2.6 %. Among smear positive PTB, prevalence of HIV co-infection was very high 5 (55.5 %). Smoking cigarette regularly for greater than 5 years, BMI lower than 18.5 and HIV infection were factors associated with smear positive PTB.

10.1186_s12879_016_1766_x	Drug-resistant tuberculosis in Central Mozambique: the role of a rapid genotypic susceptibility testing	Background: Genotypic molecular testing may be very helpful for tuberculosis (TB) drug-resistance surveillance and for treatment guidance in low resource settings. Methods: Descriptive analysis of M. tuberculosis isolates from Beira Central Hospital, Mozambique, during 2014-2015. Genotype MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl were used and patient medical records reviewed. To explore genotypic susceptibility profile of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, to first and second line drugs (SLD) in Beira Mozambique. Results: Of 155 isolates, 16.1 % (25) were multidrug resistant (MDR), 8.4 % (13) isoniazid-monoresistant and 1.3 % (2) rifampicin-monoresistant. Among MDR-TB, 22.2 % showed primary and 77.8 % represented acquired resistance. The majority of patients with drug resistance had a history of previous TB treatment. Among 125 isolates tested for ethambutol and SLD, 7.2 % (9) were resistant to ethambutol, 4.8 % (6) to fluoroquinolones and 0.8 % (1) to ethambutol and fluoroquinolones. Resistance to injectable SLD was not detected. Conclusions: As far as we know this is the first report of a genotypic testing used to provide information about SLD resistance in Mozambique, where phenotypic susceptibility testing is usually unavailable. Extensively drug resistant TB was not detected in this isolates from Beira Mozambique.

10.1186_s12879_016_1745_2	Rifampicin resistance mutations in the 81 bp RRDR of rpoB gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates using Xpert MTB/RIF in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan: a retrospective study	Background: Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major public health problem especially in developing countries. World Health Organization (WHO) recommends use of Xpert MTB/RIF assay to simultaneously detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and rifampicin (RIF) resistance. The primary objective of this study was to determine the frequency of MDR-TB in patients suspected to have drug resistance in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The frequency of probes for various rpoB gene mutations using Xpert MTB/RIF assay within 81 bp RRDR (Rifampicin Resistance Determining Region) was the secondary objective. Methods: A total of 2391 specimens, received at Programmatic Management of Drug Resistant TB (PMDT) Unit, Lady Reading Hospital (LRH) Peshawar, Pakistan, between October 2011 and December 2014, were analyzed by Xpert MTB/RIF test. MTB positive with rifampicin resistance were further analyzed to first line anti-mycobacterial drug susceptibility testing (DST) using middle brook 7H10 medium. The data was analyzed using statistical software; SPSS version 18. Results: Out of 2391 specimens, 1408 (59 %) were found positive for MTB and among them, 408 (29 %) showed rifampicin-resistance with four different rpoB gene mutations within 81 bp RRDR. The frequency of various probes among RIF-resistant isolates was observed as: probe E, in 314 out of 408 isolates; B, 44 out of 408; A, 5 out of 408; D, 34 out of 408; and probe C was observed among 6 out of 408 RIF-resistant isolates. The probe A&B and E&D mutation combination was found in only 1 isolate in each case, while B&D mutation combination was detected among 3 out of 408 RIF-resistant isolates. Conclusions: Hence, it is concluded from our study on a selected population, 29 % of patients had MDR-TB. Probe E related mutations (also known as codon 531and 533) were the most common rpoB genetic mutation [ 314 (77 %)], acknowledged by Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Least mutation was detected within the sequence 511 (1.2 %).

10.1371_journal.pone.0160992	Whole-Genome Sequencing Analysis of Serially Isolated Multi-Drug and Extensively Drug Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis from Thai Patients	Multi-drug and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR and XDR-TB) are problems that threaten public health worldwide. Only some genetic markers associated with drug-resistant TB are known. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is a promising tool for distinguishing between re-infection and persistent infection in isolates taken at different times from a single patient, but has not yet been applied in MDR and XDR-TB. We aim to detect genetic markers associated with drug resistance and distinguish between reinfection and persistent infection from MDR and XDR-TB patients based on WGS analysis. Samples of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n = 7), serially isolated from 2 MDR cases and 1 XDR-TB case, were retrieved from Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok. TheWGS analysis used an Illumina Miseq sequencer. In cases of persistent infection, MDR-TB isolates differed at an average of 2 SNPs across the span of 2-9 months whereas in the case of reinfection, isolates differed at 61 SNPs across 2 years. Known genetic markers associated with resistance were detected from strains susceptible to streptomycin (2/7 isolates), p-aminosalicylic acid (3/7 isolates) and fluoroquinolone drugs. Among fluoroquinolone drugs, ofloxacin had the highest phenotype-genotype concordance (6/7 isolates), whereas gatifloxcain had the lowest (3/7 isolates). A putative candidate SNP in Rv2477c associated with kanamycin and amikacin resistance was suggested for further validation. WGS provided comprehensive results regarding molecular epidemiology, distinguishing between persistent infection and reinfection in M/XDR-TB and potentially can be used for detection of novel mutations associated with drug resistance.

10.4269_ajtmh.15_0668	Tuberculosis Treatment Outcome and Drug Resistance in Lambarene, Gabon: A Prospective Cohort Study	Despite overall global progress in tuberculosis (TB) control, TB remains one of the deadliest communicable diseases. This study prospectively assessed TB epidemiology in Lambarene, Gabon, a Central African country ranking 10th in terms of 113 incidence rate in the 2014 World Health Organization TB report. In Lambarene, between 2012 and 2014, 201 adult and pediatric TB patients were enrolled and followed up; 66% had bacteriologically confirmed TB and 95% had pulmonary TB. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection rate was 42% in adults and 16% in children. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium africanum were identified in 82% and 16% of 108 culture-confirmed TB cases, respectively. Isoniazid (INH) and streptomycin yielded the highest resistance rates (13% and 12%, respectively). The multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) rate was 4/91 (4%) and 4/13 (31%) in new and retreatment TB cases, respectively. Treatment success was achieved in 53% of patients. In TB/HIV coinfected patients, mortality rate was 25%. In this setting, TB epidemiology is characterized by a high rate of TB/HIV coinfection and low treatment success rates. MDR-TB is a major public health concern; the need to step-up in-country diagnostic capacity for culture and drug susceptibility testing as well as access to second-line TB drugs urgently requires action.

pub-0297	Prevalence and drug resistance pattern of MDR TB in retreatment cases of Punjab, Pakistan	Objective: To determine the prevalence and resistance pattern of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out from January 2010 to June 2014 in nine tertiary care hospitals implementing programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis in Punjab, and comprised retreatment tuberculosis cases. Data was collected from the Electronic Nominal Review System. SPSS 17 was used for data analysis. Results: Of the 1,250 cases, 861(69%) were of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis confirmed through drug sensitivity testing. The mean age was 32 (+/- 13.5 SD) years. Besides, 664(53%) were males and 1,208(97%) resided in urban areas of Punjab. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was found to be more prevalent in the most productive age group, i.e. 15-45 years, with 709(57%) cases (p<0.05), in urban areas1, 208(97%) cases (p<0.05) and in the pulmonary site 852(68%) cases (p<0.05). Overall, 391(41%) cases showed resistance to all first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs while 239(28%) showed resistance to oral first-line drugs. Besides, 526(42%) cases showed resistance to fluoroquinolones and 650(52%) to second-line drugs. Of them, 420(81%), (p<0.05) patients showed highly significant resistance to fluoroquinolones and 26(5%) to ethionamide. Conclusion: There is a need to fully implement national tuberculosis guidelines with a focus on expansion and effective implementation of directly observed therapy short course in order to prevent further emergence of drug resistance.

10.1093_jac_dkw107	Unnatural amino acid analogues of membrane-active helical peptides with anti-mycobacterial activity and improved stability	The emergence of MDR-TB, coupled with shrinking antibiotic pipelines, has increased demands for new antimicrobials with novel mechanisms of action. Antimicrobial peptides have increasingly been explored as promising alternatives to antibiotics, but their inherent poor in vivo stability remains an impediment to their clinical utility. We therefore systematically evaluated unnatural amino acid-modified peptides to design analogues with enhanced anti-mycobacterial activities. Anti-mycobacterial activities were evaluated in vitro and intracellularly against drug-susceptible and MDR isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using MIC, killing efficacy and intracellular growth inhibition studies. Toxicity profiles were assessed against mammalian cells to verify cell selectivity. Anti-mycobacterial mechanisms were investigated using microfluidic live-cell imaging with time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Unnatural amino acid incorporation was well tolerated without an appreciable effect on toxicity profiles and secondary conformations of the synthetic peptides. The modified peptides also withstood proteolytic digestion by trypsin. The all d-amino acid peptide, i(llkk)(2)i (II-D), displayed superior activity against all six mycobacterial strains tested, with a 4-fold increase in selectivity index as compared with the unmodified l-amino acid peptide in broth. II-D effectively reduced the intracellular bacterial burden of both drug-susceptible and MDR clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis after 4 days of treatment. Live-cell imaging studies demonstrated that II-D permeabilizes the mycobacterial membrane, while confocal microscopy revealed that II-D not only permeates the cell membrane, but also accumulates within the cytoplasm. Unnatural amino acid modifications not only decreased the susceptibility of peptides to proteases, but also enhanced mycobacterial selectivity.

10.1128_AAC.00425_16	Moxifloxacin Improves Treatment Outcomes in Patients with Ofloxacin-Resistant Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	It is unclear whether the use of moxifloxacin (MFX), a newer synthetic fluoroquinolone, results in better outcomes in patients with ofloxacin (OFX)-resistant multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). During the period from April 2006 to December 2013, a total of 2,511 patients with culture-confirmed tuberculosis (TB) were treated at a TB referral hospital in southern Taiwan. Of the 2,511 patients, 325 (12.9%) had MDR-TB, and of those 325 patients, 81 (24.9%) had OFX-resistant MDR-TB and were included in the study. Among the 81 patients with OFX-resistant MDR-TB, 50 (61.7%) were successfully treated and 31 (38.3%) had unfavorable outcomes, including treatment failure (n = 25; 30.9%), loss to follow-up (n = 2; 2.5%), and death (n = 4; 4.9%). Patients treated with MFX had a significantly higher rate of treatment success (77.3% versus 43.2%; odds ratio [OR] = 4.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.710 to 11.646, P = 0.002) than patients not treated with MFX, especially among those infected with MFX-susceptible isolates (40.7%) or isolates with low-level resistance to MFX (28.4%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that treatment with MFX (adjusted odds ratio = 6.54, 95% CI = 1.44 to 29.59, P = 0.015) was the only independent factor associated with treatment success. Mutation at codon 94 in the gyrA gene was the most frequent mutation (68.0%) associated with high-level MFX resistance. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that treatment with MFX was also an independent factor associated with early culture conversion (hazard ratio = 3.12, 95% CI = 1.48 to 6.54, P = 0.003). Our results show that a significant proportion of OFX-resistant MDR-TB isolates were susceptible or had low-level resistance to MFX, indicating that patients with OFX-resistant MDR-TB benefit from treatment with MFX.

10.1128_AAC.03008_15	Determination of MIC Breakpoints for Second-Line Drugs Associated with Clinical Outcomes in Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment in China	Our study aims to identify the clinical breakpoints (CBPs) of second-line drugs (SLDs) above which standard therapy fails in order to improve multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment. MICs of SLDs were determined for M. tuberculosis isolates cultured from 207 MDR-TB patients in a prospective cohort study in China between January 2010 and December 2012. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to identify the CBPs predictive of treatment outcome. Of the 207 MDR-TB isolates included in the present study, the proportion of isolates above the critical concentration recommended by WHO ranged from 5.3% in pyrazinamide to 62.8% in amikacin. By selecting pyrazinamide as the primary node (CBP, 18.75 mg/liter), 72.1% of sputum culture conversions at month four could be predicted. As for treatment outcome, pyrazinamide (CBP, 37.5 mg/liter) was selected as the primary node to predict 89% of the treatment success, followed by ofloxacin (CBP, 3 mg/liter), improving the predictive capacity of the primary node by 10.6%. Adjusted by identified confounders, the CART-derived pyrazinamide CBP remained the strongest predictor in the model of treatment outcome. Our findings indicate that the critical breakpoints of some second-line drugs and PZA need to be reconsidered in order to better indicate MDR-TB treatment outcome.

10.1016_j.bmcl.2016.06.019	An evolved oxazolidinone with selective potency against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and gram positive bacteria	Innovation of new antibacterials that are effective against strains that have developed resistance to existing drugs would strengthen our ability to treat and subsequently control spread of pathogenic bacteria. Increasing incidence of infections with drug resistant bacteria has become a common occurrence in recent times. We have developed an evolved oxazolidinone, T145, which inhibits growth of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) with sub mu g/ml potencies that are potentially therapeutically valuable. The oxazolidinone is bactericidal against Mtb but bacteriostatic against E. faecalis and S. aureus. In addition to therapeutically valuable potency and bactericidal activity against Mtb, T145 minimizes selection of spontaneous resistant mutants, a trait that prolongs longevity of a drug in clinical use.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0815	'They prefer hidden treatment': anti-tuberculosis drug-taking practices and drug regulation in Karakalpakstan	SETTING: The joint Medecins Sans Frontieres/Ministry of Health Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Programme, Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan. OBJECTIVE: Uzbekistan has high rates of MDR-TB. We aimed to understand patients' and prescribers' attitudes to anti-tuberculosis drug prescription, regulation and drug-taking behaviour. METHODS: Participants (12 patients, 12 practitioners) were recruited purposively. Data were gathered qualitatively using field notes and in-depth interviews and analysed thematically. FINDINGS: Our analysis highlighted two main themes. First, shame and stigma were reported to increase the likelihood of self-treatment and incorrect use of anti-tuberculosis drugs, most commonly at the initial stages of illness. A health system failure to promote health information was perceived, leading to wrong diagnoses SUMMARY and inappropriate therapies. Motivated by shame, patients hid their condition by resorting to drug treatment options outside the programme, compounding the risk of chaotic management and dissemination of erroneous information through lay networks. Second, positive influences on treatment were reported through patients, practitioners and peers working effectively together to deliver the correct information and support, which acted to normalise TB, reduce stigma and prevent misuse of anti-tuberculosis drugs. CONCLUSION: Effective case finding, patient support and community education strategies are essential. Patients, practitioners and peers working together can help reduce stigma and prevent misuse of anti-tuberculosis drugs.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0896	Comparison of TaqMan (R) Array Card and MYCOTB (TM) with conventional phenotypic susceptibility testing in MDR-TB	BACKGROUND: Although phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) is endorsed as the standard for second line drug testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, it is slow and laborious. METHODS: We evaluated the accuracy of two faster, easier methodologies that provide results for multiple drugs: a genotypic TaqMan (R) Array Card (TAC) and the Sensititre (R) MYCOTB (TM) plate. Both methods were tested at three central laboratories in Bangladesh, Tanzania, and Thailand with 212 multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates and compared with the laboratories' phenotypic method in use. RESULTS: The overall accuracy for ethambutol, streptomycin, amikacin, kanamycin, ofloxacin, and moxifloxacin vs. the phenotypic standard was 87% for TAC (range 70-99) and 88% for the MYCOTB plate (range SUMMARY 76-98). To adjudicate discordances, we re-defined the standard as the consensus of the three methods, against which the TAC and MYCOTB plate yielded 94-95% accuracy, while the phenotypic result yielded 93%. Some isolates with genotypic mutations and high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were phenotypically susceptible, and some isolates without mutations and low MIC were phenotypically resistant, questioning the phenotypic standard. CONCLUSIONS: In our view, the TAC, the MYCOTB plate, and the conventional phenotypic method have similar performance for second-line drugs; however, the former methods offer speed, throughput, and quantitative DST information.	drug susceptibility testing; MDR-TB; MIC	RESISTANT MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MINIMUM INHIBITORY CONCENTRATIONS; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; AGAR PROPORTION; 2ND-LINE DRUGS; GYRA MUTATIONS; RPOB MUTATIONS; MOXIFLOXACIN; OFLOXACIN; RIFAMPIN
10.1080_17512433.2016.1200462	Bedaquiline as part of combination therapy in adults with pulmonary multi-drug resistant tuberculosis	Introduction: Few innovative anti-microbial products have been brought to market in recent years to combat the global multidrug resistant-tuberculosis (MDR-TB) epidemic. Bedaquiline, a novel oral diarylquinoline, was approved by the US FDA as a part of combination therapy in adults with pulmonary MDR-TB based on phase II trials.Area covered: Pubmed searches were conducted using search terms bedaquiline, diarylquinoline, R207910, and TMC207 was performed. Supplementary sources included World Health Organization, Clinicaltrial.gov, US Food and Drug Administration. Bedaquiline is an ATP synthase inhibitor specific for M. tuberculosis and some nontuberculous mycobacteria. It is metabolized by CYP3A4 and it's drug exposure can be influenced by inducers and inhibitors of this enzyme. Phase II studies showed promising results on efficacy of bedaquiline when being used in combination with a background regimen for MDR-TB. Main safety concerns include QTc prolongation and hepatotoxicity. Phase III trials are ongoing to confirm efficacy findings from phase II studies and provide additional evidence of safety and efficacy.Expert commentary: Critical data for long-term efficacy and safety are incomplete and scarce, supporting the cautious use of bedaquiline.

10.1371_journal.pone.0159560	Effects of Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment on Patients' Health Related Quality of Life: Results from a Follow Up Study	Background At present, within the management of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) much attention is being paid to the traditional microbiological and clinical indicators. Evaluation of the impact of MDR-TB treatment on patients' Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) has remained a neglected area. Objective To evaluate the impact of MDR-TB treatment on patients HRQoL, and determine the predictors of variability in HRQoL along the course of treatment Methods A prospective follow up study was conducted at the programmatic management unit for drug resistant TB of Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar. Culture confirmed eligible MDR-TB patients were asked to self complete SF-36v2 at the baseline visit, and subsequently after the completion of 12 months of treatment and at the end of treatment. A score of <47 norm-based scoring (NBS) points on component summary measures and health domain scales was considered indicative of function impairment. General linear model repeated measures ANOVA was used examine the change and predictors of change in physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores over the time. Results A total of 68 out of enrolled 81 eligible MDR-TB patients completed SF-36v2 questionnaire at the three time points. Patients' mean PCS scores at the three time points were, 38.2 +/- 4.7, 38.6 +/- 4.4 and 42.2 +/- 5.2 respectively, and mean MCS were 33.7 +/- 7.0, 35.5 +/- 6.9 and 40.0 +/- 6.9 respectively. Length of sickness prior to the diagnosis of MDR-TB was predictive of difference in PCS scores (F = 4.988, Df = 1, 66), whereas patients' gender (F = 5.638, Df = 1, 66) and length of sickness prior to the diagnosis of MDR-TB (F = 4.400, Df = 1, 66) were predictive of difference in MCS scores. Conclusion Despite the positive impact of MDR-TB treatment on patients' HRQoL, the scores on component summary measures suggested compromised physical and mental health even at the end of treatment. A large multicenter study is suggested to confirm the present findings.

10.1186_s12879_016_1723_8	Where there is hope: a qualitative study examining patients' adherence to multi-drug resistant tuberculosis treatment in Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan	Background: Treatment for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is lengthy, has severe side effects, and raises adherence challenges. In the Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) and Ministry of Health (MoH) programme in Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan, a region with a high burden of MDR-TB, patient loss from treatment (LFT) remains high despite adherence support strategies. While certain factors associated with LFT have been identified, there is limited understanding of why some patients are able to adhere to treatment while others are not. We conducted a qualitative study to explore patients' experiences with MDR-TB treatment, with the aim of providing insight into the barriers and enablers to treatment-taking to inform future strategies of adherence support. Methods: Participants were purposively selected. Programme data were analysed to enable stratification of patients by adherence category, gender, and age. 52 in-depth interviews were conducted with MDR-TB patients (n = 35) and health practitioners (n = 12; MSF and MoH doctors, nurses, and counsellors), including five follow-up interviews. Interview notes, then transcripts, were analysed using coding to identify emerging patterns and themes. Manual analysis drew upon principles of grounded theory with constant comparison of codes and categories within and between cases to actively seek discrepancies and generate concepts from participant accounts. Ethics approval was received from the MoH of the Republic of Uzbekistan Ethics Committee and MSF Ethics Review Board. Results: Several factors influenced adherence. Hope and high quality knowledge supported adherence; autonomy and control enabled optimal engagement with treatment-taking; and perceptions of the body, self, treatment, and disease influenced drug tolerance. As far as we are aware, the influence of patient autonomy and control on MDR-TB treatment-taking has not previously been described. In particular, the autonomy of married women around treatment-taking was potentially undermined through their societal position as daughter-in-law, compromising their ability to adhere to treatment. Patients' engagement with and adherence to treatment could be hindered by hierarchical practitioner-patient relationships that displaced authority, ownership, and responsibility from the patient. Conclusions: Our findings reinforce the need for an individualised and holistic approach to adherence support with engagement of patients as active participants in their care who feel ownership and responsibility for their treatment.

10.1371_journal.pone.0159651	Rapid Screening of MDR-TB in Cases of Extra Pulmonary Tuberculosis Using Geno Type MTBDRplus	Background Drug resistance in tuberculosis is a major public health challenge in developing countries. The limited data available on drug resistance in extra pulmonary tuberculosis stimulated us to design our study on anti-tuberculosis drug resistance pattern in cases of extra pulmonary tuberculosis in a tertiary referral hospital of North India. We performed Geno Type MTBDRplus assay in comparison with conventional drug susceptibility testing by proportion method to study the mutation patterns in rpoB, katG and inhA genes. Methods A total of 510 extra pulmonary samples were included in this study. After the smear microscopy, all the specimens were subjected for culture on Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) media. Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed on LJ media for all the MTB isolates and compared with the results of Geno Type MTBDRplus assay which was performed with the DNA isolated from the culture by conventional method. Results Of 510 specimens cultured, the total culture positivity obtained was 11.8% (60) encompassing 54 (10.6%) Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 6 (1.2%) non-tubercular mycobacteria (NTM). DST results by Geno Type MTBDRplus assay and solid culture methods were compared in 51 MTB isolates excluding the two Rif indeterminate and one invalid test. Geno Type MTBDRplus accurately identified 13 of 14 rifampicin-resistant strains, 14 of 15 isoniazid-resistant strains and 13 of 14 as multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in comparison with conventional method. Sensitivity and specificity were 92.86% and 97.30% respectively for detection of RIF resistance, 93.33% and 94.44% respectively for detection of INH resistance, 92.86% and 97.30% respectively for detection of MDR-TB, while the overall concordance of Geno Type MTBDRplus assay with conventional DST was 94.11%. The turn-around time for performing Geno Type MTBDRplus assay test was 48 hours. Conclusion The problem of MDR in extra pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) cannot be overlooked and due attention on patients should be given. Routine use of Geno Type MTBDRplus assay for the diagnosis of MDR-EPTB can substantially reduce the time between diagnosis and drug therapy. Culture along with Geno Type MTBDRplus assay could be a solution for rapid and accurate diagnosis of MDR-TB in low bacillary non sputum specimens.

10.1186_s12889_016_3210_y	Primary and secondary anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in Hitossa District of Arsi Zone, Oromia Regional State, Central Ethiopia	Background: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) drugs which is resistant to the major first-line anti-TB drugs, Isoniazid and Rifampicin, has become a major global challenge in tuberculosis (TB) control programme. However, its burden at community level is not well known. Thus, the aim of study was to assess the prevalence of primary and secondary resistance to any first line anti-TB drugs and MDR TB in Hitossa District of Oromia Regional State, Central Ethiopia. Methods: Population based cross-sectional study was conducted on individuals aged >= 15 years. Those with symptoms suggestive of TB were interviewed and two sputum specimens were collected from each and examined using Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) culture medium. Further, the isolates were confirmed by the Ziehl-Neelsen microscopic examination method. Drug susceptibility test (DST) was also conducted on LJ medium using a simplified indirect proportion method. The resistance strains were then determined by percentage of colonies that grew on the critical concentration of Isoniazid, Streptomycin, Rifampicin and Ethambutol. Results: The overall resistance of all forms of TB to any first-line anti-TB drug was 21.7 %. Of the total new and previously treated culture positive TB cases, 15.3 and 48.8 % respectively were found to be a resistant to any of the first-line anti-TB drugs. Further, of all forms of TB, the overall resistance of MDR-TB was 4.7 %. However, of the total new TB cases, 2.4 % had primary while 14.3 % had secondary MDR-TB. Resistance to any of the first-line anti-TB drugs (adjusted odd ratio (AOR), 8.1; 95 % CI: 2.26-29.30) and MDR-TB (AOR), 7.1; 95 % CI: 2.6-43.8) was found to be linked with previous history of anti-TB treatment. Conclusions: The study has identified a high rate of primary and secondary resistance to any of the first-line anti-TB drugs and MDR-TB in the study area. The resistance may have resulted from sub-optimal performance of directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) programme in the detecting infectious TB cases and cure rates in the study area. Anti-TB drug resistance is linked with previous TB treatment.

10.1093_cid_ciw276	Aggressive Regimens Reduce Risk of Recurrence After Successful Treatment of MDR-TB	"Background. We sought to determine whether treatment with a ""long aggressive regimen"" was associated with lower rates of relapse among patients successfully treated for pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Tomsk, Russia. Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients that initiated MDR-TB treatment with individualized regimens between September 2000 and November 2004, and were successfully treated. Patients were classified as having received ""aggressive regimens"" if their intensive phase consisted of at least 5 likely effective drugs (including a second-line injectable and a fluoroquinolone) used for at least 6 months post culture conversion, and their continuation phase included at least 4 likely effective drugs. Patients that were treated with aggressive regimens for a minimum duration of 18 months post culture conversion were classified as having received ""long aggressive regimens."" We used recurrence as a proxy for relapse because genotyping was not performed. After treatment, patients were classified as having disease recurrence if cultures grew MDR-TB or they re-initiated MDR-TB therapy. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard regression. Results. Of 408 successfully treated patients, 399 (97.5%) with at least 1 follow-up visit were included. Median duration of follow-up was 42.4 months (interquartile range: 20.5-59.5), and there were 27 recurrence episodes. In a multivariable complete case analysis (n = 371 [92.9%]) adjusting for potential confounders, long aggressive regimens were associated with a lower rate of recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.22, 95% confidence interval, .05-.92). Conclusions. Long aggressive regimens for MDR-TB treatment are associated with lower risk of disease recurrence."	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; anti-tuberculosis treatment; tuberculosis relapse; tuberculosis recurrence	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; RUSSIA; TOMSK
10.1038_srep29727	Transregional movement of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in north China: an underlying threat to tuberculosis control	Due to unbalanced distribution of health care resource in China, tuberculosis patients, especially multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), prefer to suffer transregional movement for seeking better health care service in the first-tier cities. Here, we performed a study on the current status of transregional movement of tuberculosis in northern China by reviewing the medical record of TB patients hospitalized in Beijing Chest Hospital from 2011 to 2015. From 2011 to 2015, the proportion of non-Beijing in-patients had increased from 55.0% (996/1810) to 67.2% (1860/2769). In addition, we found that the rate of re-treated among non-Beijing group was significantly higher than that among Beijing-group. Compared with the proportion of pulmonary TB patients from non-Beijing, there were more extra-pulmonary TB patients from non-Beijing. In addition, 10.5% (164/1568) of Beijing inpatients and 26.5% (491/1858) of non-Beijing in-patients had MDR tuberculosis, and statistical analysis revealed that there was significantly higher proportion of MDR cases among non-Beijing group than Beijing group. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that an increasing proportion of TB patients from northern China seek health care in Beijing. In view of higher prevalence of MDR-TB cases among these patients, the transregional movement of MDR-TB will lead to ongoing MDR TB transmission in the community.

10.4103_0255_0857.188352	Epidemiology and patterns of drug resistance among tuberculosis patients in Northwestern Iran	Background: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has emerged as an important global health concern and is on the rise throughout the world. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the epidemiology and pattern of TB drug resistance. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 180 pulmonary TB patients from two Northwestern provinces of Iran were selected. The first and second line drug susceptibility testing was carried out using the 1% proportion method on the L phi wenstein-Jensen medium. Full demographic, environmental and clinical history was evaluated. Results: Prevalence of resistance to any TB drug was 13.8%. Eight (4.4%) patients had MDR-TB (2.4% in the province of East Azerbaijan and 9.3% in the province of Ardabil) and one patient had extensively drug-resistant TB. Patient resistance to both isoniazid and streptomycin was the most prevalent at a rate of 8.3%. Patients showed the least resistance to ethambutol (2.8%). There was a significant relationship between the previous history of TB drug treatment and TB drug resistance. Migrants from rural to urban areas were in high-risk groups for the occurrence of TB drug resistance. Conclusion: In our study, prevalence of MDR was less than the global average. It is essential to monitor the patients with previous history of TB treatment and migrants by rapid and accurate techniques in terms of drug-resistance odds.

10.1021_acsinfecdis.6b00052	Diphenylether-Modified 1,2-Diamines with Improved Drug Properties for Development against Mycobacterium tuberculosis	New treatments for tuberculosis infection are critical to combat the emergence of multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We report the characterization of a diphenylether-modified adamantyl 1,2-diamine that we refer to as TBL-140, which has a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC99) of 1.2 mu g/mL. TBL-140 is effective against drug-resistant Mtb and nonreplicating bacteria. In addition, TBL-140 eliminates expansion of Mtb in cell culture infection assays at its MIC. To define the mechanism of action of this compound, we performed a spontaneous mutant screen and biochemical assays. We determined that TBL-140 treatment affects the proton motive force (PMF) by perturbing the transmembrane potential (Delta Psi), consistent with a target in the electron transport chain (ETC). As a result, treated bacteria have reduced intracellular ATP levels. We show that TBL-140 exhibits greater metabolic stability than SQ109, a structurally similar compound in clinical trials for treatment of MDR-TB infections. Combined, these results suggest that TBL-140 should be investigated further to assess its potential as an improved therapeutic lead against Mtb.	antibiotic; drug development; tuberculosis; proton motive force; MmpL3	SPONTANEOUS MUTATION; ANTITUBERCULAR DRUG; TRANSPORTER ACRB; SQ109; DISCOVERY; OPTIMIZATION; INHIBITION; MECHANISM; BINDING; MMPL3
10.1016_j.jiph.2015.11.011	Treatment outcome among cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) in Western India: A prospective study	Multidrug-resistant TB has become a significant public health problem in a number of countries and an obstacle to effective TB control. Therefore, the present study sought to determine the treatment outcome in patients with MDR TB in seven districts and to examine the factors affecting the treatment outcome. A prospective cohort study was carried out by enrolling all the registered patients in DOTs Plus center of Vadodara district from February 2010 to December 2010. A total of 142 patients were interviewed using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire at the DOTS centers of seven districts of Gujarat or at their homes in cases of defaulters/death. After 24 months, of those 145 patients, 48 (33.10%) were declared cured, 8 (5.50%) had completed their treatment, 43 (29.70%) patients died during the treatment, and 32 (21.10%) patients defaulted during treatment. Factors associated with a significant difference in the outcomes were income, marital status, and education. Only education significantly affected treatment outcome upon applying logistic regression. Therefore, proper counseling on drug adherence should be applied at the programmatic level. (C) 2015 King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences. Published by Elsevier Limited.

10.1128_AAC.02175_15	Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Sulfamethoxazole at 800 Milligrams Once Daily in the Treatment of Tuberculosis	For treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), there is a scarcity of antituberculosis drugs. Co-trimoxazole is one of the available drug candidates, and it is already frequently coprescribed for TB-HIV-coinfected patients. However, only limited data are available on the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of co-trimoxazole in TB patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the PK parameters and in vitro PD data on the effective part of co-trimoxazole: sulfamethoxazole. In a prospective PK study in patients infected with drug-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis (drug-susceptible TB patients) (age, >18), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SXT) was administered orally at a dose of 960 mg once daily. One-compartment population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed using MW\Pharm 3.81 (Mediware, Groningen, The Netherlands). The area under the concentration-time curve for the free, unbound fraction of a drug (fAUC)/MIC ratio and the period in which the free concentration exceeded the MIC (fT > MIC) were calculated. Twelve patients received 960 mg co-trimoxazole in addition to first-line drugs. The pharmacokinetic parameters of the population model were as follows (geometric mean +/- standard deviation [SD]): metabolic clearance (CLm), 1.57 +/- 3.71 liters/h; volume of distribution (V), 0.30 +/- 0.05 liters . kg lean body mass(-1); drug clearance/creatinine clearance ratio (f(r)), 0.02 +/- 0.13; gamma distribution rate constant (ktr_po), 2.18 +/- 1.14; gamma distribution shape factor (n_po), 2.15 +/- 0.39. The free fraction of sulfamethoxazole was 0.3, but ranged between 0.2 and 0.4. The median value of the MICs was 9.5 mg/liter (interquartile range [IQR], 4.75 to 9.5), and that of the fAUC/MIC ratio was 14.3 (IQR, 13.0 to 17.5). The percentage of fT > MIC ranged between 43 and 100% of the dosing interval. The PK and PD data from this study are useful to explore a future dosing regimen of co-trimoxazole for MDR-TB treatment.

10.1136_archdischild_2015_310186	Dilemma of managing asymptomatic children referred with 'culture-confirmed' drug-resistant tuberculosis	Background The diagnosis of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) in children is challenging and treatment is associated with many adverse effects. Objective We aimed to assess if careful observation, without initiation of second-line treatment, is safe in asymptomatic children referred with 'culture-confirmed' DR-TB. Setting KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa-an area with high burdens of HIV, TB and DR-TB. Design, intervention and main outcome measures We performed an outcome review of children with 'culture-confirmed' DR-TB who were not initiated on second-line TB treatment, as they were asymptomatic with normal chest radiographs on examination at our specialist referral hospital. Children were followed up every other month for the first year, with a final outcome assessment at the end of the study. Results In total, 43 asymptomatic children with normal chest radiographs were reviewed. The median length of follow-up until final evaluation was 549 days (IQR 259-722 days); most (34; 83%) children were HIV uninfected. Resistance patterns included 9 (21%) monoresistant and 34 (79%) multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. Fifteen children (35%) had been treated with first-line TB treatment, prior to presentation at our referral hospital. At the final evaluation, 34 (80%) children were well, 7 (16%) were lost to follow-up, 1 (2%) received MDR-TB treatment and 1 (2%) died of unknown causes. The child who received MDR-TB treatment developed new symptoms at the 12-month review and responded well to second-line treatment. Conclusions Bacteriological evaluation should not be performed in the absence of any clinical indication. If drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis is detected in an asymptomatic child with a normal chest radiograph, close observation may be an appropriate strategy, especially in settings where potential laboratory error and poor record keeping are constant challenges.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0977	Sputum smear microscopy result: a predictor for drug-resistant tuberculosis?	Until countries establish capacity for continuous surveillance systems, representative surveys of tuberculosis (TB) patients continue to improve our understanding of the burden of drug-resistant TB and help ensure appropriate allocation of resources. Although the available data are limited, the current recommendation of restricting surveys to sputum smear-positive patients is justified, given the greatly simplified logistics and only limited evidence in specific settings of an association between drug resistance and sputum smear status. Nonetheless, the relationship between drug resistance and sputum smear microscopy results may vary according to the setting and population under study. With the increasing availability and use of molecular diagnostics and the drive for universal drug susceptibility testing under the World Health Organization's End TB Strategy, substantially more data on drug resistance in the whole TB patient population should become available in the near future.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0874	Drug resistance and associated genetic mutations among patients with suspected MDR-TB in Uttar Pradesh, India	SETTING: Programmatic Management of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (PMDT) programme in 32 districts of Uttar Pradesh (UP), India. OBJECTIVE: To provide epidemiological status of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and associated microbial genetic mutations among suspected cases in UP. DESIGN: We retrospectively studied and tested using line-probe assay (LPA) 4895 retreatment patients with suspected MDR-TB who were enrolled for PMDT during 2012-2015. The demographic characteristics of cases, LPA-determined drug resistance, the genetic mutation profile, trends in drug resistance over the study period as well as the comparative performance of LPA and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) were analysed. RESULTS: MDR-TB and rifampicin-resistant TB (RR TB) were confirmed in respectively 34.5% and 40.3% cases. The RR-TB detection rate (a valid proxy for MDR-TB) initially declined during the study period. Age 30 years and implemented MDR-TB suspicion criteria were independent predictors for RR-TB (P < 0.01). LPA indicated predominant distribution of S531L (1483/ 1970, 75.3%) and S315T1 (1981/2116, 93.6%) mutations in the rpoB and katG genes, respectively, and had >94.0% agreement with phenotypic DST in determining rifampicin/isoniazid resistance. CONCLUSION: MDR-TB prevalence in retreatment cases is very high, highlighting the need to reduce the development and transmission of drug-resistant TB.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0696	Xpert (R) MTB/RIF detection of rifampin resistance and time to treatment initiation in Harare, Zimbabwe	BACKGROUND: Patients at elevated risk of drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) are prioritized for Xpert (R) MTB/RIF testing; however, the clinical usefulness of the test in this population is understudied. DESIGN: From November 2011 to June 2014, consecutive out-patients with a history of previous TB in high density suburbs of Harare, Zimbabwe, were tested using Xpert, solid and liquid culture, and the microscopic observation drug susceptibility assay. Diagnostic accuracy for rifampin (RMP) resistance and time to initiation of second-line regimens were ascertained. The rpoB gene was sequenced in cases with culture-confirmed RMP resistance and genotypic susceptibility. RESULTS: Among 352 retreatment patients, 71 (20%) were RMP-resistant, 98 (28%) RMP-susceptible, 64 (18%) culture-negative/Xpert-positive, and 119 (34%) culture-negative/Xpert-negative. Xpert had a sensitivity of 86% (95%CI 75-93) and a specificity of 98% (95%CI 92-100) for RMP-resistant TB. The positive predictive value of Xpert-determined RMP resistance for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was 82% (95%CI 70-91). Of 71 (83%) participants, 59 initiated treatment with second-line drugs, with a median time to treatment initiation of 18 days (IQR 10-44). CONCLUSION: The diagnostic accuracy of Xpert for RMP resistance is high, although the predictive value for MDR-TB was lower than anticipated. Xpert allows for faster initiation of second-line treatment than culture based drug susceptibility testing under programmatic conditions.

10.1007_s10916_016_0517_2	An Imbalanced Learning based MDR-TB Early Warning System	As a man-made disease, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is mainly caused by improper treatment programs and poor patient supervision, most of which could be prevented. According to the daily treatment and inspection records of tuberculosis (TB) cases, this study focuses on establishing a warning system which could early evaluate the risk of TB patients converting to MDR-TB using machine learning methods. Different imbalanced sampling strategies and classification methods were compared due to the disparity between the number of TB cases and MDR-TB cases in historical data. The final results show that the relative optimal predictions results can be obtained by adopting CART-USBagg classification model in the first 90 days of half of a standardized treatment process.

10.1038_srep28701	Mycobacteriophage SWU1 gp39 can potentiate multiple antibiotics against Mycobacterium via altering the cell wall permeability	M. tuberculosis is intrinsically tolerant to many antibiotics largely due to the imperviousness of its unusual mycolic acid-containing cell wall to most antimicrobials. The emergence and increasingly widespread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) revitalized keen interest in phage-inspired therapy. SWU1gp39 is a novel gene from mycobacteriophage SWU1 with unknown function. SWU1gp39 expressed in M. smegmatis conferred the host cell increased susceptibility to multiple antibiotics, including isoniazid, erythromycin, norfloxacin, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, rifampicin and vancomycin, and multiple environment stresses such as H2O2, heat shock, low pH and SDS. By using EtBr/Nile red uptake assays, WT-pAL-gp39 strain showed higher cell wall permeability than control strain WT-pAL. Moreover, the WT-pAL-gp39 strain produced more reactive oxygen species and reduced NAD(+)/NADH ratio. RNA-Seq transcriptomes of the WT-pAL-gp39 and WT-pAL revealed that the transcription of 867 genes was differentially regulated, including genes associated with lipid metabolism. Taken together, our results implicated that SWU1gp39, a novel gene from mycobacteriophage, disrupted the lipid metabolism of host and increased cell wall permeability, ultimately potentiated the efficacy of multiple antibiotics and stresses against mycobacteria.

10.1093_aje_kwv323	Scenario Analysis for Programmatic Tuberculosis Control in Western Province, Papua New Guinea	Tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) are major health problems in Western Province, Papua New Guinea. While comprehensive expansion of TB control programs is desirable, logistical challenges are considerable, and there is substantial uncertainty regarding the true disease burden. We parameterized our previously described mathematical model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis dynamics in Western Province, following an epidemiologic assessment. Five hypothetical scenarios representing alternative programmatic approaches during the period from 2013 to 2023 were developed with local staff. Bayesian uncertainty analyses were undertaken to explicitly acknowledge the uncertainty around key epidemiologic parameters, and an economic evaluation was performed. With continuation of existing programmatic strategies, overall TB incidence remained stable at 555 cases per 100,000 population per year (95% simulation interval (SI): 420, 807), but the proportion of incident cases attributable to MDR-TB increased from 16% to 35%. Comprehensive, provincewide strengthening of existing programs reduced incidence to 353 cases per 100,000 population per year (95% SI: 246, 558), with 46% being cases of MDR-TB, while incorporating programmatic management of MDR-TB into these programs reduced incidence to 233 cases per 100,000 population per year (95% SI: 198, 269) with 14% MDR-TB. Most economic costs were due to hospitalization during the intensive treatment phase. Broad scale-up of TB control activities in Western Province with incorporation of programmatic management of MDR-TB is vital if control is to be achieved. Community-based treatment approaches are important to reduce the associated economic costs.

10.1186_s12879_016_1615_y	High-resolution melting analysis for molecular detection of multidrug resistance tuberculosis in Peruvian isolates	Background: The emergence of multidrug-resistant strains is a major health problem especially for countries with high TB incidence such as Peru. In this study, we evaluated High Resolution Melting (HRM) assay in Peruvian isolates for the detection of mutations within rpoB, katG genes and promoter region inhA to determine isoniazid and rifampicin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Methods: DNA samples extracted from a total of 167 clinical isolates of Mtb, 89 drug-sensitive and 78 multidrug-resistant, were blindly analyzed by HRM analysis and verified by DNA sequencing. Results: The HRM analysis generated patterns that were specific to distinguish between sensitive and resistance isolates. The sensitivity and specificity of the HRM assays in comparison with drug susceptibility testing (DST) for detection of rifampicin resistance were 98.7 % and 97.5 %, and for isoniazid resistance were 98.7 % and 100 %. Conclusion: This study suggests that HRM Analysis could help with rapid diagnosis of MDR-TB cases in Peru.

10.3109_23744235.2016.1153806	Survival of smear-positive multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients in Witbank, South Africa: A retrospective cohort study	Background A retrospective cohort study was carried out to compare the survival between smear-positive patients and smear-negative multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients hospitalised in a specialised TB hospital in Witbank, South Africa. Methods A review of medical records of MDR-TB patients treated from 2001 to 2010 was carried out. Survival time was measured from a patient's date of hospitalisation to the date when the patient died, was last treated at the hospital or the end of the study (whichever came first). All patients who were alive until the end of the study period or lost to follow-up were censored and those who died were considered as failures. Survival patterns were estimated using Kaplan Meier plots, log rank tests and life tables. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were also conducted. Results The mean age of the 442 MDR-TB patients in the study was 37.7 +/- 11.2 years. The incidence rates of mortality were 13.4 and 43.9 per 1000 person-months for smear-negative and smear-positive MDR-TB patients, respectively. Cox proportional hazard regression showed that the predictors of death among MDR-TB patients include HIV co-infection (adjusted Hazard Rate, aHR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.02-3.52), old age (above 60 years) (aHR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.04-3.60) and smear positivity at diagnosis (aHR = 3.29, 95% CI = 2.39-4.64). Conclusion The study showed that the probability of survival during the treatment is reduced in MDR-TB patients, who are smear-positive, HIV positive or older than 60 years. Special care should be given to these patients to improve survival.	smear; positive; tuberculosis; survival; cohort; resistant; Multidrug	TREATMENT OUTCOMES; PREDICTORS; MORTALITY
10.1016_j.ijid.2016.02.003	Tuberculosis and mass gatherings-opportunities for defining burden, transmission risk, and the optimal surveillance, prevention, and control measures at the annual Hajj pilgrimage	Tuberculosis (TB) is now the most common infectious cause of death worldwide. In 2014, an estimated 9.6 million people developed active TB. There were an estimated three million people with active TB including 360 000 with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) who were not diagnosed, and such people continue to fuel TB transmission in the community. Accurate data on the actual burden of TB and the transmission risk associated with mass gatherings are scarce and unreliable due to the small numbers studied and methodological issues. Every year, an estimated 10 million pilgrims from 184 countries travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) to perform the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. A large majority of pilgrims come from high TB burden and MDR-TB endemic areas and thus many may have undiagnosed active TB, sub-clinical TB, and latent TB infection. The Hajj pilgrimage provides unique opportunities for the KSA and the 184 countries from which pilgrims originate, to conduct high quality priority research studies on TB under the remit of the Global Centre for Mass Gatherings Medicine. Research opportunities are discussed, including those related to the definition of the TB burden, transmission risk, and the optimal surveillance, prevention, and control measures at the annual Hajj pilgrimage. The associated data are required to develop international recommendations and guidelines for TB management and control at mass gathering events. (C) 2016 The Authors.

10.1179_2046905515Y.0000000041	High prevalence of primary drug resistance in children with intrathoracic tuberculosis in India	Background: Drug susceptibility testing (DST) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) isolates is crucial for the effective treatment of tuberculosis. Data on DST patterns in Mtb isolates in childhood tuberculosis are scanty. Aims: To determine drug resistance patterns in Mtb isolates from a paediatric TB cohort in North India. Methods: 403 children aged 6 months to 14 years with probable intrathoracic tuberculosis were enrolled prospectively. All were treatment-naive. 802 ambulatory-induced sputa (IS) and 787 gastric aspirate (GA) samples were cultured in BACTEC-MGIT960 system, and DST of the Mtb isolates was undertaken using the automated BACTEC-MGIT960 SIRE kit. Results: Of the 403 children, 147 (36.4%) were culture-confirmed: 132 (89.8%) isolates were Mtb and 15 (10.2%) non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Five Mtb isolates were contaminated and the remaining 127 were subjected to in-vitro drug susceptibility testing against streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol. Twenty-six (20.47%) isolates were resistant to one or more drugs, seven (5.5%) were resistant to rifampicin singly or in combination, and 11 (8.7%) were resistant to isoniazid singly or in combination. Mono-resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin and ethambutol was detected in four (3.1%), one (0.8%), four (3.1%) and two (1.6%), respectively. Five children (3.9%) had MDR-TB; 101 (79.9%) children had Mtb isolates which were sensitive to all four drugs. Conclusions: The rifampicin and isoniazid resistance rates were much higher than those in the adult TB population in India.

10.1016_j.jmgm.2016.04.005	Insights into RpoB clinical mutants in mediating rifampicin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Rifampicin (RIF) an essential first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug, resistance to RIF is a potential threat to TB control program and widely considered as surrogate marker for detection of multi-drug resistant-TB (MDR-TB), molecular understanding of which is the utmost need of the hour. Mutations at RIF resistance determining region (RRDR) of 81-bp in the rpoB gene coding for 13 subunit or RpoB protein is the major cause of RIF resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Mutation at positions 526 and 531 are generally associated with high-level RIF resistance and at codons 516, 521 and 533 with low-level resistance. Thus, in order to understand the interactions between the clinical mutants (MTs) of RpoB and RIF which are responsible for mediating both levels of RIF resistance from MTB. In the present study, models of wild type (WT) and seven MTs (D516V, L521M, H526D, H526R, H526Y, S531L and L533P) of RpoB from MTB were generated using crystal structure of 2A68 and 4KBM as templates, for deducing 3 domains structure. Molecular docking between RpoB proteins and RIF was carried out, which showed higher values for WT compared to MTs. The high score in WT may be due to the presence of favorable interactions with RIF and MT-L521M which lacks in other MTs. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed for over 10 nanoseconds, which suggest the root mean square deviation (RMSD) was more and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) was less in WT compared to MTs. The ligand RMSD exhibited very unique deviation with the MT-D516V compared to other MTs and WT. The RMSF for MTs such as H526R H526D, L521M and D516V were higher for residues such as 152, 265, 352, 402, 513, 552, and 577 compared to WT. Hydrogen bond interactions at RIF binding site after MD simulations were found comparatively lower in WT than MTs. Similarly, the binding energy of wr was observed to be lesser in comparison to MTs. All MTs demonstrated certain (2 angstrom) degree of structural deviation from the WT. Overall, these results suggest that RIF binding ability shows differences between WT and MTs, which could be because of different substitutions affecting the conformation of the MT proteins, leading to changes in binding interactions with RIF, eventually to the cause of RIF resistance.

10.1016_j.jmii.2015.04.003	Second-line anti-tuberculosis drug resistance and its genetic determinants in multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates	Background: Mutations in several genetic loci have been implicated in the development of resistance to second-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs (SLDs). The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of resistance to SLDs and its association with specific mutations in multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates. Materials and methods: The study included 46 MDR-TB isolates. Mutation profiling was performed by amplifying and sequencing the following six genes: gyrA/gyrB, rrs, tlyA, and ethA/ethR, in which mutations are implicated in resistance of tubercle bacilli to ofloxacin (OFX), amikacin (AMK), capreomycin, and ethionamide (ETH), respectively. Results: Of the strains analyzed, 14 (30.4%) showed resistance to at least one of the four SLDs tested. Mutations in the gyrA gene occurred in 34 (73.9%) strains, with the most common amino acid change being Ser95Thr. The Asp94Asn and Ala90Val substitutions in the gyrA were present exclusively in OFX-resistant strains, yet represented only 40% of all OFX-resistant strains. The only mutation in the gyrB gene was substitution Ser447Phe, detected in one OFX-resistant isolate. None of the AMK-resistant strains carried a mutation in the rrs gene. Mutations in the ethA/ethR loci were found in one ETH-resistant and 11 ETH-susceptible strains. Conclusions: The results of this study challenge the usefulness of sequence analyses of tested genes (except gyrA) for the prediction of SLD resistance patterns and highlight the need for searching other genetic loci for detection of mutations conferring resistance to SLDs in M. tuberculosis.

10.1128_AAC.03014_15	MIC of Delamanid (OPC-67683) against Mycobacterium tuberculosis Clinical Isolates and a Proposed Critical Concentration	The increasing global burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) requires reliable drug susceptibility testing that accurately characterizes susceptibility and resistance of pathogenic bacteria to effectively treat patients with this deadly disease. Delamanid is an anti-TB agent first approved in the European Union in 2014 for the treatment of pulmonary MDR-TB in adults. Using the agar proportion method, delamanid MIC was determined for 460 isolates: 316 from patients enrolled in a phase 2 global clinical trial, 76 from two phase 2 early bactericidal activity trials conducted in South Africa, and 68 isolates obtained outside clinical trials (45 from Japanese patients and 23 from South African patients). With the exception of two isolates, MICs ranged from 0.001 to 0.05 mu g/ml, resulting in an MIC50 of 0.004 mu g/ml and an MIC90 of 0.012 mu g/ml. Various degrees of resistance to other anti-TB drugs did not affect the distribution of MICs, nor did origin of isolates from regions/countries other than South Africa. A critical concentration/breakpoint of 0.2 mu g/ml can be used to define susceptible and resistant isolates based on the distribution of MICs and available pharmacokinetic data. Thus, clinical isolates from delamanid-naive patients with tuberculosis have a very low MIC for delamanid and baseline resistance is rare, demonstrating the potential potency of delamanid and supporting its use in an optimized background treatment regimen for MDR-TB.

10.1007_s00253_015_7268_8	Screening of antitubercular compound library identifies novel shikimate kinase inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis	"Shikimate kinase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids through shikimate pathway. The enzyme is essential for the survival of M. tuberculosis and is absent from mammals, thus providing an excellent opportunity for identifying new chemical entities to combat tuberculosis with a novel mechanism of action. In this study, an antitubercular library of 1000 compounds was screened against M. tuberculosis shikimate kinase (MtSK). This effort led to the identification of 20 inhibitors, among which five promising leads exhibited half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values below 10 mu M. The most potent inhibitor (""5631296"") showed an IC50 value of 5.10 mu M +/- A 0.6. The leads were further evaluated for the activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains, mode of action, docking simulations, and combinatorial study with three frontline anti-TB drugs. Compound ""5491210"" displayed a nearly synergistic activity with rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol while compound ""5631296"" was synergistic with rifampicin. In vitro cytotoxicity against HepG2 cell line was evaluated and barring one compound; all were found to be non-toxic (SI > 10). In order to rule out mitochondrial toxicity, the promising inhibitors were also evaluated for cell cytotoxicity using galactose medium where compounds ""5631296"" and ""5122752"" appeared non-toxic. Upon comprehensive analysis, compound ""5631296"" was found to be the most promising MtSK inhibitor that was safe, synergistic with rifampicin, and bactericidal against M. tuberculosis."

10.1016_j.jgar.2016.01.007	Haarlem 3 is the predominant genotype family in multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the capital of Iran: A 5-year survey	The objective of this study was to further understand the genetic diversity of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates prevalent in Tehran, the capital city of Iran. From January 2010 to March 2015, a total of 723 M. tuberculosis strains were isolated from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). A total of 23 MDR, pre-XDR and XDR M. tuberculosis isolates were genotyped by spoligotyping and 24-loci mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variablenumber tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing. The results showed that the MDR, pre-XDR and XDR M. tuberculosis strains mainly belonged to the Haarlem 3 genotype (11/23; 47.8%), followed by the Beijing family (9/23; 39.1%). In addition, the 23 strains were clustered into 21 genotypes using a 24-loci MIRU-VNTR. In conclusion, Haarlem 3 genotype was the predominant genotype among the isolates from MDR-TB cases in this study, which could be of special concern.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0895	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Norway: a nationwide study, 1995-2014	SETTING: The management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is strictly regulated in Norway. However, nationwide studies of the epidemic are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To describe the MDR-TB epidemic in Norway over two decades. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of data on MDR-TB cases in Norway, 1995-2014, obtained from the national registry, patient records and the reference laboratory, with genotyping and cluster analysis data. Data for non-MDR-TB cases were collected from the national registry. RESULTS: Of 4427 TB cases, 89 (2.0%) had MDR-TB, 7% of whom had extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) and 24% pre-XDR-TB. Of the 89 MDR-TB cases, 96% were immigrants, mainly from the Horn of Africa or the former Soviet Union (FSU); 37% had smear-positive TB; and 4% were human immunodeficiency virus co-infected. Of the 19% infected in Norway, the majority belonged to a Delhi/Central Asian lineage cluster in a local Somali community. Among the MDR-TB cases, smear-positive TB and FSU origin were independent risk factors for XDR/pre-XDR-TB. Treatment was successful in 66%; 17% were lost to follow-up, with illicit drug use and adolescence being independent risk factors. Forty-four per cent of patients treated with linezolid discontinued treatment due to adverse effects. CONCLUSION:MDR-TB is rare in Norway and is predominantly seen in immigrants from the Horn of Africa and FSU. Domestic transmission outside immigrant populations is minimal.	risk factor; immigrants; treatment outcome; linezolid; Norway	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MDR-TB; EFFICACY; SAFETY; TOLERABILITY; COUNTRIES; COHORT
10.5588_ijtld.15.0259	Sputum bacterial load predicts multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in retreatment patients: a case-control study	BACKGROUND: Rapid and effective diagnosis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is an essential component of global tuberculosis (TB) control, but most MDR-TB cases are still not diagnosed. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patient sputum bacterial load can be used to identify patients at increased risk of MDR-TB. METHODS: We used a case-control study and multi variable logistic regression models to investigate associations between MDR-TB and sputum bacterial load, as measured by semi-quantitative microscopy and automated time to detection (TTD) of liquid culture. We assessed data from retreatment TB patients with MDR-TB (cases) and from those without MDR-TB (controls) at a reference laboratory in Cameroon. RESULTs: MDR-TB was associated with a smear microscopy grade of 3+ (OR 21.9, 95%CI 6.2-76.8) or 2+ (OR 10.8, 95 % CI 2.9-40.7), compared to a result of 1+, scanty or smear-negative among 80 MDR-TB cases and 521 controls. MDR-TB was associated with automated TTD of 160 h (OR 2.2, 95%CI 1.1-4.7) compared to >160 h among a subpopulation of 47 cases and 350 controls. CONCLUSIONS: A higher sputum bacterial load is associated with MDR-TB in retreatment patients in Cameroon.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0668	Frequency and risk factors of drug-induced liver injury during treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the risk factors for drug induced liver injury (DILI) during the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and to compare the frequency of DILI in patients with and those without chronic liver disease (CLD). SETTING: This was a retrospective observational cohort study including 299 consecutive patients who started MDR-TB treatment from January 2009 to December 2013. DESIGN: Of the 299 patients, 35 had alcoholic liver disease (ALD group), 16 had hepatitis B virus infection (HBV group) and 11 had hepatitis C virus infection (HCV group). The remaining 237 patients without CLD were selected as the control group. RESULTS: DILI occurred in 29 (9.7%) patients. The frequency of DILI was significantly higher in the ALD (17.1%, P=0.038), HBV (31.3%, P=0.005) and HCV groups (27.3%, P = 0.037) than in the control group (6.3%). Among all patients taken together, having HBV and HCV infection were independent risk factors for the occurrence of DILI during MDR-TB treatment. CONCLUSION: DILI during MDR-TB treatment occurred more frequently in patients with CLD due to ALD, HBV and HCV infection than in those without CLD.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0621	Distribution and association of Mycobacterium tuberculosis CAS lineage with multidrug resistance in North India	SETTING: A tertiary care hospital in North India. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of different genotypes and examine their association with drug resistance among clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the northern region of India. DESIGN: We analysed 100 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis using mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units genotyping and TbD1 analysis. RESULTS: The analysis revealed that 34% of strains belonged to the Delhi/CAS (TbD1-) lineage, 32% had unknown patterns (27 TbD1-, 5 TbD1+), 18% were of Beijing genotype (TbD1-) and 11% were of EM lineages (TbD1+). Twenty-one strains were multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), 9 of which belonged to the Delhi/CAS lineage, 4 were of Beijing lineage, 6 were of unknown pattern and one was of EM lineage. Our meta analysis showed the overall proportion of CAS lineage to be 42.96% (95%CI 33-52); the CAS lineage had no association with MDR-TB (OR 0.89, 95%CI 0.66-1.20). CONCLUSION: The study highlights the high proportion of CAS lineage strains and absence of association with MDR-TB. The distribution and identification of different genotypes of M. tuberculosis could help in better understanding the factors that influence disease transmission and drug resistance.	tuberculosis; molecular epidemiology; MIRU-VNTR; drug resistance; meta-analysis	INTERSPERSED REPETITIVE UNITS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; GENETIC DIVERSITY; DRUG-RESISTANCE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; STRAINS; COMPLEX; PREDOMINANCE; PAKISTAN
10.1016_j.meegid.2016.02.019	Whole genome sequencing to complement tuberculosis drug resistance surveys in Uganda	Understanding the circulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance mutations is vital for better TB control strategies, especially to inform a new MDR-TB treatment programme. We complemented the phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) based drug resistance surveys (DRSs) conducted in Uganda between 2008 and 2011 with Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of 90 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates phenotypically resistant to rifampicin and/or isoniazid to better understand the extent of drug resistance. A total of 31 (34.4 %) patients hadMDR-TB, 5 (5.6 %) mono-rifampicin resistance and 54 (60.0 %) mono-isoniazid resistance by phenotypic DST. Pyrazinamide resistance mutations were identified in 32.3% of the MDR-TB patients. Resistance to injectable agents was detected in 4/90 (4.4%), and none to fluoroquinolones or novel drugs. Compensatory mutations in rpoC were identified in two patients. The sensitivity and specificity of drug resistance mutations compared to phenotypic DST were for rpoB 88.6% and 98.1%, katG 60.0% and 100%, fabG1 16.5% and 100%, katG and/or fabG1 71.8% and 100%, embCAB 63.0% and 82.5%, rrs 11.4% and 100%, rpsL 20.5% and 95.7% and rrs and/or rpsL 31.8% and 95.7%. Phylogenetic analysis showed dispersed MDR-TB isolate, with only one cluster of three Beijing family from South West Uganda. Among tuberculosis patients in Uganda, resistance beyond first-line drugs as well as compensatory mutations remain low, and MDR-TB isolates did not arise from a dominant clone. Our findings show the potential use of sequencing for complementing DRSs or surveillance in this setting, with good specificity compared to phenotypic DST. The reported high confidence mutations can be included inmolecular assays, and population-based studies can track transmission of MDR-TB including the Beijing family strains in the South West of the country.

10.1128_JCM.00251_16	Multicenter Noninferiority Evaluation of Hain GenoType MTBDRplus Version 2 and Nipro NTM plus MDRTB Line Probe Assays for Detection of Rifampin and Isoniazid Resistance	Less than 30% of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients are currently diagnosed, due to laboratory constraints. Molecular diagnostics enable rapid and simplified diagnosis. Newer-version line probe assays have not been evaluated against the WHO-endorsed Hain GenoType MTBDRplus (referred to as Hain version 1 [V1]) for the rapid detection of rifampin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) resistance. A two-phase noninferiority study was conducted in two supranational reference laboratories to allow head-to-head comparisons of two new tests, Hain Genotype MTBDRplus version 2 (referred to as Hain version 2 [V2]) and Nipro NTM+MDRTB detection kit 2 (referred to as Nipro), to Hain V1. In phase 1, the results for 379 test strains were compared to a composite reference standard that used phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) and targeted sequencing. In phase 2, the results for 644 sputum samples were compared to a phenotypic DST reference standard alone. Using a challenging set of strains in phase 1, the values for sensitivity and specificity for Hain V1, Hain V2, and Nipro, respectively, were 90.3%/98.5%, 90.3%/98.5%, and 92.0%/98.5% for RIF resistance detection and 89.1%/99.4%, 89.1%/99.4%, and 89.6%/100.0% for INH resistance detection. Testing of sputa in phase 2 yielded values for sensitivity and specificity of 97.1%/97.1%, 98.2%/97.8%, and 96.5%/97.5% for RIF and 94.4%/96.4%, 95.4%/98.8%, and 94.9%/97.6% for INH. Overall, the rates of indeterminate results were low, but there was a higher rate of indeterminate results with Nipro than with Hain V1 and V2 in samples with low smear grades. Noninferiority of Hain V2 and Nipro to Hain V1 was demonstrated for RIF and INH resistance detection in isolates and sputum specimens. These results serve as evidence for WHO policy recommendations on the use of line probe assays, including the Hain V2 and Nipro assays, for MDR-TB detection.

10.1371_journal.pone.0155968	Programmatic Management of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis: An Updated Research Agenda	Introduction There are numerous challenges in delivering appropriate treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and the evidence base to guide those practices remains limited. We present the third updated Research Agenda for the programmatic management of drug-resistant TB (PMDT), assembled through a literature review and survey. Methods Publications citing the 2008 research agenda and normative documents were reviewed for evidence gaps. Gaps were formulated into questions and grouped as in the 2008 research agenda: Laboratory Support, Treatment Strategy, Programmatically Relevant Research, Epidemiology, and Management of Contacts. A survey was distributed through snowball sampling to identify research priorities. Respondent priority rankings were scored and summarized by mean. Sensitivity analyses explored weighting and handling of missing rankings. Results Thirty normative documents and publications were reviewed for stated research needs; these were collapsed into 56 research questions across 5 categories. Of more than 500 survey recipients, 133 ranked priorities within at least one category. Priorities within categories included new diagnostics and their effect on improving treatment outcomes, improved diagnosis of paucibacillary and extra pulmonary TB, and development of shorter, effective regimens. Interruption of nosocomial transmission and treatment for latent TB infection in contacts of known MDR-TB patients were also top priorities in their respective categories. Results were internally consistent and robust. Discussion Priorities retained from the 2008 research agenda include shorter MDR-TB regimens and averting transmission. Limitations of recent advances were implied in the continued quest for: shorter regimens containing new drugs, rapid diagnostics that improve treatment outcomes, and improved methods of estimating burden without representative data. Conclusion There is continuity around the priorities for research in PMDT. Coordinated efforts to address questions regarding shorter treatment regimens, knowledge of disease burden without representative data, and treatment for LTBI in contacts of known DR-TB patients are essential to stem the epidemic of TB, including DR-TB.

10.1093_cid_ciw012	Infection Control for Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis: Early Diagnosis and Treatment Is the Key	"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, ""Ebola with wings,"" is a significant threat to tuberculosis control efforts. Previous prevailing views that resistance was mainly acquired through poor treatment led to decades of focus on drug-sensitive rather than drug-resistant (DR) tuberculosis, driven by the World Health Organization's directly observed therapy, short course strategy. The paradigm has shifted toward recognition that most DR tuberculosis is transmitted and that there is a need for increased efforts to control DR tuberculosis. Yet most people with DR tuberculosis are untested and untreated, driving transmission in the community and in health systems in high-burden settings. The risk of nosocomial transmission is high for patients and staff alike. Lowering transmission risk for MDR tuberculosis requires a combination approach centered on rapid identification of active tuberculosis disease and tuberculosis drug resistance, followed by rapid initiation of appropriate treatment and adherence support, complemented by universal tuberculosis infection control measures in healthcare facilities. It also requires a second paradigm shift, from the classic infection control hierarchy to a novel, decentralized approach across the continuum from early diagnosis and treatment to community awareness and support. A massive scale-up of rapid diagnosis and treatment is necessary to control the MDR tuberculosis epidemic. This will not be possible without intense efforts toward the implementation of decentralized, ambulatory models of care. Increasing political will and resources need to be accompanied by a paradigm shift. Instead of focusing on diagnosed cases, recognition that transmission is driven largely by undiagnosed, untreated cases, both in the community and in healthcare settings, is necessary. This article discusses this comprehensive approach, strategies available, and associated challenges."	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; infection control; diagnosis; treatment; community	HEALTH-CARE WORKERS; SOUTH-AFRICA; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; NOSOCOMIAL TRANSMISSION; MDR-TB; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; XPERT MTB/RIF; XDR-TB; IMPLEMENTATION
10.1093_cid_ciw037	Exposed, but Not Protected: More Is Needed to Prevent Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Healthcare Workers and Students	"Occupational MDR-TB"" ... ""XDR-TB"" ... ""Treatment-induced hearing loss"": 3 life-changing messages imparted over the phone. Three personal accounts are shared highlighting the false belief held by many healthcare workers (HCWs) and students in low-resource settings-that they are immune to tuberculosis despite high levels of occupational tuberculosis exposure. This misconception reflects a lack of awareness of tuberculosis transmission and disease risk, compounded by the absence of accurate occupational tuberculosis estimates. As the global problem of drug-resistant (DR) tuberculosis evolves, HCWs are increasingly infected and suffer considerable morbidity and mortality from occupational DR tuberculosis disease. Similarly, healthcare students are emerging as a vulnerable and unprotected group. There is an urgent need for improved detection, vaccines, preventive therapy, treatment, and support for affected HCWs and those they care for, as well as destigmatization of all forms of tuberculosis. Finally, efforts to protect HCWs and prevent DR tuberculosis transmission by universal implementation of tuberculosis infection control measures should be prioritized."	healthcare workers; tuberculosis; students; tuberculosis infection control; drug-resistant tuberculosis	SOUTH-AFRICA; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; TREATMENT REGIMENS; MEDICAL-STUDENTS; TB; INFECTION; RISK; THERAPIES; DOCTORS; CLINICS
10.1016_j.phymed.2016.02.017	In vitro activity of (-)-deoxypergularinine, on its own and in combination with anti-tubercular drugs, against resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Background: The increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) infections has created a need for new effective drugs that also target extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) and/or augment the activities of existing drugs against tuberculosis. Aim: This study searched natural products for a new lead compound that targets MDR/XDR-TB. Methods: An active compound was purified from the roots of Cynanchum atratum Bunge (Asclepiadaceae) after screening 1640 plant extracts, and its inhibitory effects against MDR/XDR strains and synergistic effects with existing anti-TB drugs were assessed using the resazurin, MGIT, and checkboard assays. Results: (-)-Deoxypergularinine, purified from the roots of C. atratum, inhibited not only M. tuberculosis but also MDR/XDR strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of (-)-deoxypergularinine for H37Ra, H37Rv, MDR, and XDR strains were all about 12.5 mu g/ml. Moreover, combinations of (-)-deoxypergularinine with the first-line standard drugs rifampicin or isoniazid afforded six-and eight-fold reductions in drug MIC values, respectively, against strain H37Ra. Conclusions: (-)-Deoxypergularinine exerts anti-tubercular activities not only against normal tuberculosis strains but also MDR/XDR strains, and synergic effects with rifampicin and isoniazid for the H37Ra strain. The alkaloid may be valuable for targeting M/XDR M. tuberculosis. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

10.1016_j.gene.2016.02.003	Whole genome analysis of an MDR Beijing/W strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with large genomic deletions associated with resistance to isoniazid	Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) is one of the most prevalent bacterial pathogens in the world. With geographical wide spread and hypervirulence, Beijing/W family is the most successful M.tb lineage. China is a country of high tuberculosis (TB) and high multiple drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) burden, and the Beijing/W family strains take the largest share of MDR strains. To study the genetic basis of Beijing/W family strains' virulence and drug resistance, we performed the whole genome sequencing of M.tb strain W146, a clinical Beijing/W genotype MDR isolated from Wuxi, Jiangsu province, China. Compared with genome sequence of M.tb strain H37Rv, we found that strain W146 lacks three large fragments and the missing of furA-katG operon confers isoniazid resistance. Besides the missing of furA-katG operon, strain W146 harbored almost all known drug resistance associated mutations. Comparison analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels between strain W146 and Beijing/W genotype strains and non-Beijing/W genotype strains revealed that strain W146 possessed some unique mutations, which may be related to drug resistance, transmission and pathogenicity. These findings will help to understand the large sequence polymorphisms (LSPs) and the transmission and drug resistance related genetic characteristics of the Beijing/W genotype of M.tb.

10.1186_s12866_016_0699_2	Prevalence and molecular characteristics of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Beijing, China: 2006 versus 2012	Background: As the epidemic of MDR-TB and XDR-TB becomes increasingly severe, it is important to determine the clinical characteristics and molecular epidemiology of MDR-TB and XDR-TB. Recently, many studies have shown that clinical features and molecular characteristics of drug-resistant strains vary in different geographical areas, however, further information is needed to assess the dynamic evolution of drug-resistant TB. Comparative studies between different time periods are necessary to elucidate the development of drug-resistant TB. Results: A total of 255 and 537 strains were collected from Beijing Chest Hospital in 2006 and in 2012, respectively. Drug-resistance rates and mutations associated with resistance to first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs were compared. The overall rate of drug resistance among strains of TB in 2012 was 54.4 %, significantly higher than that in 2006 (34.9 %, P < 0.001). Rates of resistance to each first-line drug (isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin and ethambutol) and to second-line drug ofloxacin increased significantly from 2006 to 2012. The overall MDR rate also increased significantly from 2006 (14.9 %) to 2012 (27.0 %). The rate of MDR increased significantly between these two time periods in previously treated cases (P = 0.023) but not in new cases (P = 0.073), and the rate of XDR was similar in new cases at the two time periods, but was marginally higher in 2012 in previously treated cases (P = 0.056). Previous treatment was found to be a risk factor for drug-resistant TB, especially for MDR-TB. In addition, the proportion of drug resistant isolates in which katG, the mabA-inhA promoter, oxyR-ahpC intergenic region, rpoB, rpsL, and embB were mutated was similar in 2006 and 2012, however patterns of mutation in these loci were more diverse in 2012 compared to 2006. Conclusions: Our data suggests that the prevalence of drug resistant TB remains high in Beijing, China, and that increasing rates of resistance in M. tuberculosis to all anti-TB drugs should be considered when choosing an optimal anti-TB regimen. Moreover, acquired multi-drug resistance may play a primary role in the MDR-TB epidemic in Beijing, China. Consequently, this highlights the importance of an earlier start to effective and supervised treatment in order to reduce the burden of retreatment.

10.1371_journal.pone.0154142	Use of Lot Quality Assurance Sampling to Ascertain Levels of Drug Resistant Tuberculosis in Western Kenya	Objective To classify the prevalence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in two different geographic settings in western Kenya using the Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) methodology. Design The prevalence of drug resistance was classified among treatment-naive smear positive TB patients in two settings, one rural and one urban. These regions were classified as having high or low prevalence of MDR-TB according to a static, two-way LQAS sampling plan selected to classify high resistance regions at greater than 5% resistance and low resistance regions at less than 1% resistance. Results This study classified both the urban and rural settings as having low levels of TB drug resistance. Out of the 105 patients screened in each setting, two patients were diagnosed with MDR-TB in the urban setting and one patient was diagnosed with MDR-TB in the rural setting. An additional 27 patients were diagnosed with a variety of mono-and poly-resistant strains. Conclusion Further drug resistance surveillance using LQAS may help identify the levels and geographical distribution of drug resistance in Kenya and may have applications in other countries in the African Region facing similar resource constraints.

10.3389_fmicb.2016.00394	Improving Control of Tuberculosis in Low-Burden Countries: Insights from Mathematical Modeling	Tuberculosis control and elimination remains a challenge for public health even in low burden countries. New technology and novel approaches to case-finding, diagnosis, and treatment are causes for optimism but they need to be used cost-effectively. This in turn requires improved understanding of the epidemiology of TB and analysis of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different interventions. We describe the contribution that mathematical modeling can make to understanding epidemiology and control of TB in different groups, guiding improved approaches to public health interventions. We emphasize that modeling is not a substitute for collecting data but rather is complementary to empirical research, helping determine what are the key questions to address to maximize the public-health impact of research, helping to plan studies, and making maximal use of available data, particularly from surveillance, and observational studies. We provide examples of how modeling and related empirical research inform policy and discuss how a combination of these approaches can be used to address current questions of key importance, including use of whole-genome sequencing, screening and treatment for latent infection, and combating drug resistance.

10.1134_S0026261716030164	Proteomic analysis of sensitive and multi drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is caused by bacteria that are resistant to the most effective anti TB drugs (Isoniazid and Rifampicin) with or without resistance to other drugs. Novel intervention strategies to eliminate this disease based on finding proteins can be used for designing new drugs or new and reliable kits for diagnosis. The aim of this study was to compare the protein profile of MDR-TB with sensitive isolates. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) along with mass spectrometry is a powerful and effective tool to identification and characterization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was used for diagnosis and comparison of proteins. We identified 14 protein spots in MDR-TB isolates that 2DE analysis showed these spots absent in M. tuberculosis sensitive isolates (Rv1876, Rv0379, Rv0147, Rv2031c, Rv3597c, Rv1886c, MT0493, Rv0440, Rv3614c, Rv1626, Rv0443, Rv0475, Rv3057 and unknown protein. The results showed 22 protein spots which were up regulated (or expressed) by the MDR-TB isolates, (Rv1240, Rv3028c, Rv2971, Rv2114c, Rv3311, Rv3699, Rv1023, Rv1308, Rv3774, Rv0831c, Rv2890c, Rv1392, Rv0719, Rv0054, Rv3418c, Rv0462, Rv2215, Rv2986c, Rv3248c and Rv1908c)). Two up regulated protein spots were identified in sensitive isolate (Rv1133c and Rv0685). These data will provide valuable clues in further investigation for suitable TB rapid tests or drug targets against drug resistant and sensitive of M. tuberculosis.

10.1007_s00112_015_0001_y	Social withdrawal - psychotic or somatic? Tb-meningoencephalitis as a diagnostic challenge	In an Angolan girl with skin tuberculosis an MDR-Tb-Meningoencephalitis was found to be the cause of acute social withdrawal. She was treated with Linezolid, Moxifloxacin, Protionamid and Capreomycin under brain edema prophylaxis with prednisolone. After three months of adequate therapy tuberculoma lead to focal symptoms which subsided under high -dose dexamethasone. Descrease of incidence of tuberculosis has stagnated in Europe in the past years. Tbmeningoencephalitis with its often unspecific symptoms imposes a special challenge to clinicians. PCR sensitivity decreases in paediatric paucibacillary tuberculosis. Cultural and language differences may alter neurological findings and attention should be paid to the fact that unspecific behavioural changes may be the leading symptome of tuberculous meningoencephalitis.

10.1590_0074_02760150454	Effects of the encapsulation of usnic acid into liposomes and interactions with antituberculous agents against multidrug-resistant tuberculosis clinical isolates	Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has acquired resistance and consequently the antibiotic therapeutic options available against this microorganism are limited. In this scenario, the use of usnic acid (UA), a natural compound, encapsulated into liposomes is proposed as a new approach in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) therapy. Thus the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the encapsulation of UA into liposomes, as well as its combination with antituberculous agents such as rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) against MDR-TB clinical isolates. The in vitro antimycobacterial activity of UA-loaded liposomes (UA-Lipo) against MDR-TB was assessed by the microdilution method. The in vitro interaction of UA with antituberculous agents was carried out using checkerboard method. Minimal inhibitory concentration values were 31.25 and 0.98 mu g/mL for UA and UA-Lipo, respectively. The results exhibited a synergistic interaction between RIF and UA [fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) = 0.31] or UA-Lipo (FICI = 0.28). Regarding INH, the combination of UA or UA-Lipo revealed no marked effect (FICI = 1.30-2.50). The UA-Lipo may be used as a dosage form to improve the antimycobacterial activity of RIF, a first-line drug for the treatment of infections caused by Mtb.

10.1016_j.bjid.2016.01.004	Evaluation of resistance acquisition during tuberculosis treatment using whole genome sequencing	Tuberculosis (TB) is still considered a major global public health problem in the world and there is a concern about the worldwide increase of drug-resistance (DR). This paper describes the analysis of three Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from a single patient collected over a long treatment period of time. DR was initially investigated through phenotypic testing, followed by line probe assays (LPAs) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). It presents an intriguing situation where a multidrug-resistant (MDR-) TB case was diagnosed and treated based only on late phenotypic drug susceptibility testing of isolate 1. During the treatment, another two isolates were cultivated: isolate 2, nine months after starting MDR-TB treatment; and isolate 3, cultivated five months later, during regular use of anti-TB drugs. These two isolates were evaluated using molecular LPA and WGS, retrospectively. All mutations detected by LPA were also detected in the WGS, including conversion from fluoroquinolones susceptibility to resistance from isolate 2 to isolate 3. WGS showed additional mutations, including some which may confer resistance to other drugs not tested (terizidone/cycloserine) and mutations with no correspondent resistance in drug susceptibility testing (streptomycin and second-line injectable drugs).

10.1002_bkcs.10765	Putative 3D Structure of QcrB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis Cytochrome bc1 Complex, a Novel Drug-Target for New Series of Antituberculosis Agent Q203	Tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is still a serious world health problem. There is an urgent need for an effective drug against rapidly arising multiple-drug resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant M. tuberculosis (XDR-TB) strains. Q203 was recently reported as the most promising M. tuberculosis agent, which is also active against MDR-TB and XDR-TB. The cytochrome b subunit of the cytochrome bc1 complex (QcrB) was identified as a drug target in M. tuberculosis (Rv2196) for Q203. Herein, we have built the homology models of M. tuberculosisQcrB WT and T313A mutants using the X-ray structures of other species' QcrB as templates: Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Paracoccus denitrificans, yeast and bovine. The model with the best quality based on the structural validation results was selected for docking and used for analyzing Q203-binding mode. These insightful information will be beneficial to the further development of imidazo pyridine amide series as novel antituberculosis drugs.

10.1016_j.ijid.2016.03.003	Taking forward the World TB Day 2016 theme 'Unite to End Tuberculosis' for the WHO Africa Region	Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global emergency, with an estimated 9.6 million new TB cases worldwide reported in 2014. Twenty-eight percent of these cases were in the World Health Organization (WHO) Africa Region, where the annual case detection rate was 281 per 100 000 population-more than double the global average of 133 per 100 000. Of the 9.6 million people who developed TB, an estimated 1.2 million (12%) were HIV-positive, and the Africa Region accounted for 74% of these cases. Three million people with TB remain undiagnosed and untreated. Globally, an estimated 480 000 had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Whilst of the African countries, only South Africa has reported a high prevalence of MDR-TB, it is likely that all of Sub-Saharan Africa has an unreported high load of drug-resistant TB. Tragically, in 2014, only 48% of individuals diagnosed with MDR-TB had successful treatment and an estimated 190 000 people died of MDR-TB. Of the global TB funding gap of US$ 0.8 billion, the largest funding gap was in the Africa Region, amounting to US$ 0.4 billion in 2015. The MDR-TB pandemic in particular now threatens to devastate entire regions and may fundamentally alter the life-expectancy and demographic profile of many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The theme designated for this year's World TB Day, March 24, 2016, is 'Unite to End TB'. From the Africa Region, there is an urgent need to seriously address the political, economic, and social factors that influence host-Mycobacterium tuberculosis interactions and result in disease. Recent political and funder initiatives that provide renewed hope for the alleviation of Africa's TB and TB/ HIV problems are discussed.

10.1016_j.ijid.2016.03.021	Tuberculosis and HIV co-infection in Vietnam	"Tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are leading causes of disease and death in Vietnam, but TB/HIV disease trends and the profile of co-infected patients are poorly described. Methods: We examined national TB and HIV notification data to provide a geographic overview and describe relevant disease trends within Vietnam. We also compared the demographic and clinical profiles of TB patients with and without HIV infection. Results: During the past 10 years (2005-2014) cumulative HIV case numbers and deaths increased to 298,151 and 71,332 respectively, but access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) improved and new infections and deaths declined. From 2011-2014 routine HIV testing of TB patients increased from 58.9% to 72.5% and of all TB patients diagnosed with HIV in 2014, 2,803 (72.4%) received ART. The number of multidrug resistant (MDR)-TB cases enrolled for treatment increased almost 3-fold (578 to 1,532) from 2011-2014. The rate of HIV co-infection in MDR and non -MDR TB cases (51/1,532; 3.3% vs 3,774/100,555; 3.8%; OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.7-1.2) was similar in 2014. Conclusions: The care of TB/HIV co-infected patients have shown sustained improvement in Vietnam. Rising numbers of MDR -TB cases is a concern, but this is not ""driven"" by HIV co-infection.

10.1016_j.tube.2016.02.001	Impaired NK cells' activity and increased numbers of CD4+CD25+regulatory T cells in multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis patients	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) often causes persistent infection and chemotherapy failure, which brings heavy burden of society and family. Many immune cell subsets and regulatory mechanisms may operate throughout the various stages of infection. The presence of regulatory T cells (Tregs) is thought to be an important mechanism that TB successfully evades the immune system. Tregs play a central role in the prevention of autoimmunity and in the control of immune responses. The role of Tregs in MDR-TB infection and persistence is inadequately documented. The current study was designed to determine whether CD4 + CD25+ regulatory T cells may modulate innate immunity (such as NK cells) against human tuberculosis. Our results indicated that the numbers of CD4 + CD25+ Treg cells increased in MDR-TB patients' blood, and the cytokine production of IL-10 increased from MDR-patients compared with healthy subjects, along with the lower activity and low CD69 expression of NK cells in patients. These results suggested that immunity to MDR-TB patients induced circulating CD4 + CD25+ T regulatory cells expansion, which may be related to the persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) infection, and to the balance between effectors immune responses and suppression immune responses.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0788	A performance evaluation of MTBDRplus version 2 for the diagnosis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of a recently updated rapid molecular diagnostic test, GenoType MTBDRplus version 2, designed to detect drug resistance in both acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear-negative and -positive specimens. DESIGN: Sputum samples from 1128 patients at risk for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were tested using MTBDRplus v2 and compared with reference standard MGIT (TM) 960 (TM) drug susceptibility testing. The relationship of participant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, diabetic status, previous treatment, and smear gradation to the likelihood of obtaining an interpretable result was assessed using logistic regression. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of MTBDRplus v2 for detecting MDR-TB, when compared to a reference standard, were respectively 96.0% (95%CI 93.5-97.6) and 99.2% (95%CI 97.0-99.9) in AFB smear-positive specimens and 82.8% (95 %CI 63.5-93.5) and 98.3% (95%CI 89.9-99.9) in AFB smear-negative specimens. A dose-response relationship was observed between the proportion of interpretable test results and AFB smear bacterial load after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, HIV status, previous treatment and diabetic status. CONCLUSION: While MTBDRplus v2 performs well among both AFB smear-positive and-negative specimens, smear gradation appears to influence both the probability of obtaining an interpretable result and test sensitivity, indicating a significant association between bacillary load and test performance.	diagnostic; tuberculosis; multidrug resistance	DRUG-RESISTANCE; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; GENOTYPE MTBDRPLUS; SOUTH-AFRICA; METAANALYSIS; ASSAYS; TESTS; TB
10.5588_ijtld.15.0413	The affordability for patients of a new universal MDR-TB coverage model in China	BACKGROUND: China has piloted a new model of universal coverage for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), designed to rationalize hospital use of drugs and tests and move away from fee-for-service payment towards a standard package with financial protection against catastrophic health costs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the affordability to patients of this new model. DESIGN: This was an observational study of 243 MDR TB cases eligible for enrolment on treatment under the project. We assessed the affordability of the project from the perspective of households, with a focus on catastrophic costs. RESULTS: Of the 243 eligible cases, 172 (71%) were enrolled on treatment; of the 71 cases not enrolled, 26 (37%) cited economic reasons. The 73 surveyed cases paid an average of RMB 5977 (US$920) out-of-pocket in search costs incurred outside the pilot model. Within the pilot, they paid another RMB 2094 (US$322) in medical fees and RMB 5230 (US$805) in direct non-medical costs. Despite 90% reimbursement of medical fees, 78% of households experienced catastrophic costs, including indirect costs. CONCLUSION: The objectives of the pilot model are aligned with health reform in China and universal health coverage globally. Enrollment would almost certainly be higher with 100% reimbursement of medical fees, but patient enablers will be required to truly eliminate catastrophic costs.	financing; economics; catastrophic costs	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; FEASIBILITY; PROGRAM; COHORT
10.1111_lam.12564	Evaluation of efficiency of nested multiplex allele-specific PCR assay for detection of multidrug resistant tuberculosis directly from sputum samples	For an effective control of tuberculosis, rapid detection of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is necessary. Therefore, we developed a modified nested multiplex allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (MAS-PCR) method that enables rapid MDR-TB detection directly from sputum samples. The efficacy of this method was evaluated using 79 sputum samples collected from suspected tuberculosis patients. The performance of nested MAS-PCR method was compared with other MDR-TB detection methods like drug susceptibility testing (DST) and DNA sequencing. As rifampicin (RIF) resistance conforms to MDR-TB in greater than 90% cases, only the presence of RIF-associated mutations in rpoB gene was determined by DNA sequencing and nested MAS-PCR to detect MDR-TB. The concordance between nested MAS-PCR and DNA sequencing results was found to be 963%. When compared with DST, the sensitivity and specificity of nested MAS-PCR for RIF-resistance detection were determined to be 929 and 100% respectively. Significance and Impact of the StudyFor developing- and high-TB burden countries, molecular-based tests have been recommended by the World Health Organization for rapid detection of MDR-TB. The results of this study indicate that, nested MAS-PCR assay might be a practical and relatively cost effective molecular method for rapid detection of MDR-TB from suspected sputum samples in developing countries with resource poor settings.	multidrug resistant tuberculosis; multiplex allele-specific PCR; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; rifampicin; sputum	POLYMERASE-CHAIN-REACTION; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; RAPID DETECTION; RPOB GENE; MAS-PCR; MUTATIONS; RIFAMPIN; SYSTEM; INDIA; KATG

Methods: In Multi-Fluorescence quantitative Real-Time PCR (MF-qRT-PCR) assay, 10 probes labeled with four kinds of fluorophores were designed to detect the mutations in regions of rpoB, katG, mabA-inhA, oxyR-ahpC, and rrs. The efficiency of MF-qRT-PCR assay was tested using 261 bacterial isolates and 33 clinical sputum specimens. Among these samples, 227 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were analyzed using drug susceptibility testing (DST), DNA sequencing and MF-qRT-PCR assay. Results: Compared with DST, MF-qRT-PCR sensitivity and specificity for RIF-resistance were 94.6 and 100%, respectively. And the detection sensitivity and specificity for INH resistance were 85.9 and 95.3%, respectively. Compared with DNA sequencing, the sensitivity and specificity of our assay were 97.2 and 100% for RIF-resistance and 97.9 and 96.4% for INH-resistance. Compared with Phenotypic strain identification, MF-qRT-PCR can distinguish 227 M. tuberculosis complexes (MTC) from 34 Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) isolates with 100% accuracy rate. Conclusions: MF-qRT-PCR assay was an efficient, accurate, reliable, and easy-operated method for detection of RIF and INH-resistance, and distinction of MTC and NTM of clinical isolates.	quantitative real-time PCR; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; drug resistance; rifampicin; isoniazid	LEVEL ISONIAZID RESISTANCE; RESONANCE ENERGY-TRANSFER; RAPID DETECTION; RIFAMPIN RESISTANCE; MOLECULAR BEACONS; POINT MUTATION; PROBE ASSAY; TECHNOLOGY; COMPLEX; SUSCEPTIBILITY
10.1371_journal.pone.0153983	MDR-TB Outbreak among HIV-Negative Tunisian Patients followed during 11 Years	Background Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) outbreaks that evolve, from the outset, in a context strictly negative for HIV infection deserve special consideration since they reflect the true intrinsic epidemic potential of the causative strain. To our knowledge, the long-term evolution of such exceptional outbreaks and the treatment outcomes for the involved patients has never been reported hitherto. Here we provide a thorough description, over an 11-year period, of an MDR-TB outbreak that emerged and expanded in an HIV-negative context, Northern Tunisia. Methodology/Principal Findings From October 2001 to June 2011, the MDR-TB outbreak involved 48 HIV-negative individuals that are mainly young (mean age 31.09 yrs; 89.6% male) and noninstitutionalized. Drug susceptibility testing coupled to mutational analysis revealed that initial transmission involved an isolate that was simultaneously resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and streptomycin. The causative Haarlem3-ST50 outbreak strain expanded mainly as an 11-banded IS6110 RFLP profile (77.1%), from which a 12-banded subclone evolved. After undergoing a 2-year treatment with second-line drugs, 22 (45.8%) patients were cured and 3 (6.2%) completed treatment, thus yielding an overall treatment success rate of 52.1%. Among the patients that experienced unfavorable treatment outcomes, 10 (20.8%) failed treatment, 3 (6.2%) were lost to follow-up, 5 (10.4%) died, and 5 (10.4%) could not be evaluated. Poor adherence to treatment was found to be the main independent predictor of unfavorable outcomes (HR: 9.15; 95% CI 1.72-48.73; P = 0.014). Intriguingly, the evolved 12-banded subclone proved significantly associated with unfavorable outcomes (HR: 4.90; 95% CI 1.04-23.04, P = 0.044). High rate of fatality and relapse was further demonstrated at the long-term, since 70% of those whose treatment failed have died, and 24% among those deemed successfully treated have relapsed. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, the data obtained in this study indicate that MDR-TB clinical isolates could become fit enough to cause large and severe outbreaks in an HIV-negative context. Such MDR-TB outbreaks are characterized by low treatment success rates and could evolve towards increased severity, thus calling for early detection of cases and the necessity to raise the bar of surveillance throughout and beyond the treatment period.

10.1097_QAD.0000000000001016	Impact of HIV infection on treatment outcome of tuberculosis in Europe	Background: The effect of HIV on tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcomes has not been well established. We aimed to assess the impact of HIV infection on TB treatment outcomes by using data from notifiable disease surveillance in Europe. Methods: We analyzed the treatment outcomes of TB cases reported from nine European countries during 2010-2012. We investigate the effect of HIV on TB treatment outcomes using a multilevel and a multinomial logistic model, and considering the interaction between HIV and multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. Results: A total of 61 138 TB cases including 5.5% HIV-positive were eligible for our analysis. In the multilevel model adjusted for age and an interaction with MDR TB, HIV was significantly associated with lower treatment success in all MDR strata [non-MDR TB: odds ratio (OR) 0.24 CI (confidence interval) 0.20-0.29; unknown MDR TB status: OR 0.26 CI 0.23-0.30; MDR TB: OR 0.57 CI 0.35-0.91]. In the multinomial regression model, HIV-positive cases had significantly higher relative risk ratio (RRR) for death (non-MDR TB: RRR 4.30 CI 2.31-7.99; unknown MDR TB status: 5.55 CI 3.10-9.92; MDR TB: 3.59 CI 1.56-8.28) and being 'still on treatment' (non-MDR TB: RRR 7.27 CI 3.00-17.6; unknown MDR TB status: 5.36 CI 2.44-11.8; MDR TB: 3.76 CI 2.48-5.71). We did not find any significant association between HIV and TB treatment failure (non-MDR TB: RRR 0.50 CI 0.15-1.67; unknown MDR TB status: 1.51 CI 0.86-2.64; MDR TB: 0.51 CI 0.13-1.87). Conclusion: This large study confirms that HIV is a strong risk factor for an adverse TB treatment outcome, which is mainly manifested by an increased risk of death and still being on TB treatment.	tuberculosis; treatment outcome; HIV; coinfection; Europe	DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS-INFECTION; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; SOUTH-AFRICA; RISK-FACTORS; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; PROSPECTIVE COHORT; TB-HIV; COINFECTION; METAANALYSIS
10.1371_journal.pone.0153914	Childhood Tuberculosis in a Sub-Saharan Tertiary Facility: Epidemiology and Factors Associated with Treatment Outcome	Childhood tuberculosis (TB) is a diagnostic challenge in developing countries, and patient outcome can be influenced by certain factors. We report the disease course, clinical profile and factors associated with treatment outcome in a tertiary facility of Kinshasa. Documentary and analytical studies were conducted using clinical and exploratory data for children aged up to 15 years who were admitted to the University Clinics of Kinshasa for TB. Data are presented as frequencies and averages, and binary and logistic regression analyses were performed. Of 283 children with TB, 82 (29.0%) had smear-negative TB, 40 (14.1%) had smear-positive TB, 159 (56.1%) had extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB), 2 (0.7%) had multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), 167 (59.0%) completed treatment, 30 (10.6%) were cured, 7 (2.5%) failed treatment, 4 (1.4%) died, 55 (19.4%) were transferred to health centers nearest their home, and 20 (7.0%) were defaulters. In the binary analysis, reported TB contacts (p = 0.048), type of TB (p = 0.000), HIV status (p = 0.050), Ziehl-Nielsen test result (p = 0.000), Lowenstein culture (p = 0.004) and chest X-ray (p = 0.057) were associated with outcome. In the logistic regression, none of these factors was a significant predictor of outcome. Tertiary level care facilities must improve the diagnosis and care of patients with childhood TB, which justifies the development of alternative diagnostic techniques and the assessment of other factors that potentially affect outcome.

10.1371_journal.pone.0153563	Discordance across Phenotypic and Molecular Methods for Drug Susceptibility Testing of Drug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates in a Low TB Incidence Country	With increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), accurate drug susceptibility testing (DST) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to first-line drugs has become crucial for proper patient management. We evaluated concordance of DST results for 70 M. tuberculosis isolates across two phenotypic and two molecular methods: BACTEC 460TB, MGIT 960 system, GenoType MTBDRplus and DNA sequencing of gene segments most commonly implicated in conferring resistance to anti-TB drugs. Most (84%) M. tuberculosis isolates were multidrug-resistant. Twenty-four isolates yielded discrepant DST results. For rifampicin, isoniazid and streptomycin, 96%, 97% and 93% of isolates, respectively, were susceptible or resistant by all four methods, whereas for ethambutol, this agreement was observed for only 76% of isolates (P < 0.05 for rifampicin or isoniazid or streptomycin versus ethambutol). Occurrence of rare mutations in three isolates that confer low-level resistance caused lower agreement for rifampicin among the four methods (kappa coefficient (kappa) range, 0.84 to 0.95). For isoniazid, there was perfect agreement among phenotypic methods and molecular methods (kappa, 1.00) but lower agreement between phenotypic and molecular methods. Three isolates were detected as polydrug-resistant by MGIT 960 system but as multidrug-resistant by DNA sequence-based method. The agreement was higher for streptomycin among the two phenotypic methods (kappa, 0.97) while targeted sequencing yielded lower agreement (kappa range, 0.86 to 0.89). The discrepancy for ethambutol resulted largely due to lower concordance of MGIT 960 results (kappa range, 0.53 to 0.64). The MGIT 960 system is an accurate method for DST of M. tuberculosis against isoniazid and streptomycin while the results of rifampicin susceptibility should be complemented with DNA sequencing-based method when the suspicion for resistance is high. The possibility of false susceptibility to ethambutol with MGIT 960 system suggests that molecular or other phenotypic methods may be more useful when accurate ethambutol susceptibility results are warranted.

10.1007_s13205_016_0423_9	Emergence of mixed infection of Beijing/Non-Beijing strains among multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Pakistan	Tuberculosis (TB) remains as one of the deadliest diseases after HIV globally with 95 % of deaths confined to low-and-middle income countries. Pakistan is fifth among the 22 high-burden TB countries with the incidence rate of 230/100,000 persons, however, studies related to prevalent Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and their spread, drug resistance pattern and evolutionary genetics are inadequate. The present study was undertaken to highlight the circulation of M. tuberculosis strains causing drug resistant TB in our community by targeting the molecular marker IS6110 and then characterization of these strains as Beijing and Non-Beijing genotypes. Sputum samples from 102 MDR TB suspects from different cities of Punjab were collected and their record was stored in a database. Sputum samples were evaluated by Ziehl Neelson staining and cultured on Lownstein Jensen medium by Modified Petroff's method. DST was performed for first-line anti-mycobacterial drugs by indirect proportion method. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were investigated for the presence of IS6110 and further identification as Beijing, Non-Beijing or mixed genotype. Percentage of male and female patients was found to be 58.8 and 41.2 % respectively. DST showed resistance of 93 % of isolates to isoniazid and rifampicin. All of the isolates showed positive results for IS6110 amplification. Based on PCR amplification of Beijing and non-Beijing primer sets 4.9 % of the patients showed infection with pure Beijing isolates, 14.7 % with both Beijing and non-Beijing isolates and 80.3 % with pure non-Beijing isolates. Analysis of IS6110 and Beijing sequences showed the presence of putative transposase conserved domain while non-Beijing sequences were epitomized with RAMP_I_III superfamily domain (CRISPR-associated protein family). TB in Pakistan is predominantly caused by Non-Beijing genotypes, but Beijing strains showed incessant circulation in our community as both single and mixed (co-infecting Non-Beijing and Beijing) strains.

10.1021_acs.analchem.5b04312	Proficient Detection of Multi-Drug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis by Padlock Probes and Lateral Flow Nucleic Acid Biosensors	Tuberculosis is a major communicable disease. Its causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, becomes resistant to antibiotics by acquisition of point mutations in the chromosome. Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is an increasing public health threat, and prompt detection of such strains is of critical importance. As rolling circle amplification of padlock probes can be used to robustly distinguish single-nucleotide variants, we combined this technique with a sensitive lateral flow nucleic acid biosensor to develop a rapid molecular diagnostic test for MDR-TB, A proof-of-concept test was established for detection of the most common mutations [rpoB 531 (TCG/TTG) and katG 315 (AGC/ACC)] causing MDR-TB and verification of loss of the respective wild type. The molecular diagnostic test produces visual signals corresponding to the respective genotypes on lateral flow strips in approximately 75 min. By detecting only two mutations, the test can detect about 60% of all MDR-TB cases. The padlock probe-lateral flow (PLP-LF) test is the first of its kind and can ideally be performed at resource-limited clinical laboratories. Rapid information about the drug-susceptibility pattern can assist clinicians to choose suitable treatment regimens and take appropriate infection control actions rather than prescribing empirical treatment, thereby helping to control the spread of MDR-TB in the community.

10.1371_journal.pone.0152761	The Impact of a Line Probe Assay Based Diagnostic Algorithm on Time to Treatment Initiation and Treatment Outcomes for Multidrug Resistant TB Patients in Arkhangelsk Region, Russia	Background In the Arkhangelsk region of Northern Russia, multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) rates in new cases are amongst the highest in the world. In 2014, MDR-TB rates reached 31.7% among new cases and 56.9% among retreatment cases. The development of new diagnostic tools allows for faster detection of both TB and MDR-TB and should lead to reduced transmission by earlier initiation of anti-TB therapy. Study Aim The PROVE-IT (Policy Relevant Outcomes from Validating Evidence on Impact) Russia study aimed to assess the impact of the implementation of line probe assay (LPA) as part of an LPA-based diagnostic algorithm for patients with presumptive MDR-TB focusing on time to treatment initiation with time from first-care seeking visit to the initiation of MDR-TB treatment rather than diagnostic accuracy as the primary outcome, and to assess treatment outcomes. We hypothesized that the implementation of LPA would result in faster time to treatment initiation and better treatment outcomes. Methods A culture-based diagnostic algorithm used prior to LPA implementation was compared to an LPA-based algorithm that replaced BacTAlert and Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) for drug sensitivity testing. A total of 295 MDR-TB patients were included in the study, 163 diagnosed with the culture-based algorithm, 132 with the LPA-based algorithm. Results Among smear positive patients, the implementation of the LPA-based algorithm was associated with a median decrease in time to MDR-TB treatment initiation of 50 and 66 days compared to the culture-based algorithm (BacTAlert and LJ respectively, p<0.001). In smear negative patients, the LPA-based algorithm was associated with a median decrease in time to MDR-TB treatment initiation of 78 days when compared to the culture-based algorithm (LJ, p<0.001). However, several weeks were still needed for treatment initiation in LPA-based algorithm, 24 days in smear positive, and 62 days in smear negative patients. Overall treatment outcomes were better in LPA-based algorithm compared to culture-based algorithm (p = 0.003). Treatment success rates at 20 months of treatment were higher in patients diagnosed with the LPA-based algorithm (65.2%) as compared to those diagnosed with the culture-based algorithm (44.8%). Mortality was also lower in the LPA-based algorithm group (7.6%) compared to the culture-based algorithm group (15.9%). There was no statistically significant difference in smear and culture conversion rates between the two algorithms. Conclusion The results of the study suggest that the introduction of LPA leads to faster time to MDR diagnosis and earlier treatment initiation as well as better treatment outcomes for patients with MDR-TB. These findings also highlight the need for further improvements within the health system to reduce both patient and diagnostic delays to truly optimize the impact of new, rapid diagnostics.

10.1371_journal.pone.0153143	Assessing Local Risk of Rifampicin-Resistant Tuberculosis in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa Using Lot Quality Assurance Sampling	Background KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) has the highest burden of notified multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB cases in South Africa. A better understanding of spatial heterogeneity in the risk of drug-resistancemay help to prioritize local responses. Methods Between July 2012 and June 2013, we conducted a two-way Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) study to classify the burden of rifampicin (RIF)-resistant TB among incident TB cases notified within the catchment areas of seven laboratories in two northern and one southern district of KZN. Decision rules for classification of areas as having either a high-or low-risk of RIF resistant TB (based on proportion of RIF resistance among all TB cases) were based on consultation with local policy makers. Results We classified five areas as high-risk and two as low-risk. High-risk areas were identified in both Southern and Northern districts, with the greatest proportion of RIF resistance observed in the northernmost area, the Manguzi community situated on the Mozambique border. Conclusion Our study revealed heterogeneity in the risk of RIF resistant disease among incident TB cases in KZN. This study demonstrates the potential for LQAS to detect geographic heterogeneity in areas where access to drug susceptibility testing is limited.		RAPID ASSESSMENT; APPLICABILITY; PREVALENCE
10.1183_13993003.01654_2015	Pharmacokinetics of ertapenem in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) is becoming more challenging because of increased levels of drug resistance against second-line TB drugs. One promising group of antimicrobial drugs is carbapenems. Ertapenem is an attractive carbapenem for the treatment of MDR- and XDR-TB because its relatively long half-life enables once-daily dosing. A retrospective study was performed for all patients with suspected MDR-TB at the Tuberculosis Center Beatrixoord of the University Medical Center Groningen (Haren, the Netherlands) who received ertapenem as part of their treatment regimen between December 1, 2010 and March 1, 2013. Safety and pharmacokinetics were evaluated. 18 patients were treated with 1000 mg ertapenem for a mean (range) of 77 (5-210) days. Sputum smear and culture were converted in all patients. Drug exposure was evaluated in 12 patients. The mean (range) area under the concentration-time curve up to 24 h was 544.9 (309-1130) h.mg.L-1. The mean (range) maximum observed plasma concentration was 127.5 (73.9-277.9) mg.L-1. In general, ertapenem treatment was well tolerated during MDR-TB treatment and showed a favourable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile in MDR-TB patients. We conclude that ertapenem is a highly promising drug for the treatment of MDR-TB that warrants further investigation.

10.3855_jidc.7324	Glycated hemoglobin screening identifies patients admitted for retreatment of tuberculosis at risk for diabetes in Tanzania	Introduction: World Health Organization recommendations of bidirectional screening for tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes have been met with varying levels of uptake by national TB programs in resource-limited settings. Methodology: Kibong'oto Infectious Diseases Hospital (KIDH) is a referral hospital for TB from northern Tanzania, and the national referral hospital for multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB. Glycated hemoglobin (HgbA1c) testing was done on patients admitted to KIDH for newly diagnosed TB, retreatment TB, and MDR-TB, to determine the point prevalence of diabetes (HgbA1c >= 6.5%) and prediabetes (HgbA1c 5.7%-6.4%). Results: Of 148 patients hospitalized at KIDH over a single week, 59 (38%) had no prior TB treatment, 22 (15%) were retreatment cases, and 69 (47%) had MDR-TB. Only 3 (2%) had a known history of diabetes. A total of 144 (97%) had successful screening, of which 110 (77%) had an HgbA1c <= 5.6%, 28 (19%) had >= 5.7 < 6.5, and 6 (4%) had >= 6.5. Comparing subjects with prediabetes or diabetes to those with normal A1c levels, retreatment patients were significantly more likely to have a A1c >= 5.7% (odds ratio: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.2-9.0; p = 0.02) compared to those without prior TB treatment. No retreatment case was a known diabetic, thus the number needed to screen to diagnose one new case of diabetes among retreatment cases was 11. Conclusions: Diabetes prevalence by HgbA1c was less common than expected, but higher HgA1c values were significantly more frequent among retreatment cases, allowing for a rational, resource-conscious screening approach.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; diabetes; hemoglobin A1c; point-of-care	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; MELLITUS; IMPACT
10.1097_MD.0000000000003336	Epidemiological Trends of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in China From 2007 to 2014 A Retrospective Study	The emergence and spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) has become the major concern in global TB control nowadays due to its limited therapy options and high mortality. A comprehensive evaluation for the epidemiological trends of DR-TB in mainland China, of which TB incidences remain high, is essential but lacking. This study aimed to describe the trends of DR-TB overtime, especially multi-drugresistant TB (MDR-TB); and to identify unique characteristics of MDR TB cases compared with drug-susceptible TB cases in Mainland China. We retrospectively analyzed surveillance data collected from 36 TB prevention and control institutions in Shandong Province, China over an 8-year period. Unique characteristics of MDR-TB were identified; Chisquare test for trends and linear regression were used to assess the changes in proportions of different resistance patterns overtime. The overall MDR rate was 6.2% in our sample population. There were no statistically significant changes in the percentage of drug susceptible, isoniazid (INH) resistance, ethambatol (EMB) resistance, streptomycin (SM) resistance, and MDR TB during our study period except that the overall rifampin (REP) resistance and rifampin mono resistance (RMR) increased at a yearly rate of 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. Among those with known treatment histories, a higher MDR rate of 8.7% was observed, in which 53.9% were primary MDR-TB patients, and this rate was increasing at a yearly rate of 4.1% over our study period. MDR-TB patients were more likely to be female (odds ratio [OR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.34), aged 25 to 44 years (OR, 1.67; 95%CI, 1.45-1.93), retreated (OR, 11.95; 95%CI, 9.68-14.76), having prior TB contact (OR, 1.89; 95%CI, 1.19-2.78) and having cavity (OR, 1.57; 95%CI 1.36-1.81), or bilateral disease (OR, 1.45; 95%CI 1.19-1.76) on chest radiology. Persistent high levels of MDR-TB, increasing rates of primary MDR-TB and RMR characterize DR-TB cases in mainland China; community-acquired drug resistance may he one of the most modifiable factors in future TB control strategies.

10.1128_AAC.01049_15	Mutations in gyrA and gyrB among Fluoroquinolone- and Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates	In order to correlate the mutations inside the entire gyrA and gyrB genes with the level of resistance to ofloxacin (OFX) and moxifloxacin (MFX) in isolates of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB), a total of 111 isolates were categorized into OFX-susceptible (MIC, <= 2 mu g/ml) and low-level (MIC, 4 to 8 mu g/ml) and high-level (MIC, >= 16 mu g/ml) OFX-resistant isolates and MFX-susceptible (MIC, <= 0.5 mu g/ml) and low-level (MIC, 1 to 2 mu g/ml) and high-level (MIC, >= 4 mu g/ml) MFX-resistant isolates. Resistance-associated mutations inside the gyrA gene were found in 30.2% of OFX-susceptible and 72.5% and 72.2% of low-level and high-level OFX-resistant isolates and in 28.6% of MFX-susceptible and 58.1% and 83.9% of low-level and high-level MFX-resistant isolates. Compared with OFX-susceptible isolates, low-level and high-level OFX-resistant isolates had a significantly higher prevalence of mutations at gyrA codons 88 to 94 (17.0%, 65.0%, and 72.2%, respectively; P < 0.001) and a higher prevalence of the gyrB G512R mutation (0.0%, 2.5%, and 16.7%, respectively; P = 0.006). Similarly, compared with MFX-susceptible isolates, low-level and high-level MFX-resistant isolates had a significantly higher prevalence of mutations at gyrA codons 88 to 94 (14.3%, 51.6%, and 80.6%, respectively; P < 0.001) as well as a higher prevalence of the gyrB G512R mutation (0.0%, 0.0%, and 12.9%, respectively; P = 0.011). D94G and D94N mutations in gyrA and the G512R mutation in gyrB were correlated with high-level MFX resistance, while the D94A mutation was associated with low-level MFX resistance. The prevalence of mutations at gyrA codons 88 to 94 and the gyrB G512R mutation were higher among fluoroquinolone (FQ)-susceptible East Asian (Beijing) and Indo-Oceanic strains than they were among Euro-American strains, implying that molecular techniques to detect FQ resistance may be less specific in areas with a high prevalence of East Asian (Beijing) and Indo-Oceanic strains.

10.1016_j.pneumo.2015.09.006	Multidrug resistant tuberculosis among health personnel in Cote d'Ivoire	Multidrug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) of health workers raises the question of hospital-borne transmission of infection. Observations. - We report 4 cases of MDR-TB confirmed at the health workers over a period of 8 years (January, 2005 to December 2012), in the 2 services of pulmonology from Abidjan to Cote d'Ivoire). It was about young grown-up patients (aged between 28 and 39 years), all HIV negatives, in a no-win situation of antituberculosis treatment (3 patients/4). The most concerned staffs were the male nurses (2/4). Two agents worked in general hospital and the only one in a pulmonology department at the time of the diagnosis. The tuberculosis was of lung seat with bilateral radiographic hurt (3/4) and multiples excavations (4/4). The case index, when it was identified (2/2), was a family case. Among 3 agents who benefited from a second line treatment, 1 died further to an extensive drug resistance and 2 are declared to be cured. The fourth died before the beginning of the treatment. These cases of cure were in touch with a premature care. Conclusion. - Multidrug resistant tuberculosis at the health workers could have a negative impact on the antituberculosis fight imposing rigorous measures of infection control and better implication of the occupational medicine.

10.1093_jac_dkv354	Personalized medicine for patients with MDR-TB	The emergence of MDR-TB is a cause of great concern due to difficulties in patient management and poor treatment outcomes. Currently the duration of treatment and the choice of drugs for patients with MDR-TB are standardized in many countries. This might not be the best approach since the optimal therapy may depend on different pathogen- and host-related features. Combining the introduction of technological innovations such as whole bacillary genome sequencing for the identification of drug-resistance-associated mutations, therapeutic drug monitoring and host-directed therapies with an individualized approach to MDR-TB management will likely lead to more tolerable, shorter and more efficient treatment regimens and an increase in the quality of life of those affected by MDR-TB.

pub-0374	Early detection of multidrug resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a single tube with in-house designed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes using real-time PCR	Rapid and correct diagnosis is crucial for the management of multidrug resistance (MDR) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). The present study aims at rapid diagnosis for identification of multidrug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) using real-time PCR. FRET hybridization probes targeting most prominent four selected codons for rpoB526 and 531 and for katG314 and 315 genes were designed and evaluated on 143 clinical MTB isolates and paired sputa for rapid detection of MDR-TB. The results of real-time PCR were compared with gold standard L-J proportion method and further validated by DNA sequencing. Of the 143 MTB positive cultures, 85 and 58 isolates were found to be 'MDR' and 'pan susceptible', respectively by proportion L-J method. The sensitivity of real-time PCR for the detection of rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) were 85.88 and 94.11%, respectively, and the specificity of method was found to be 98.27%. DNA sequencing of 31 MTB isolates having distinct melting temperature (Tm) as compared to the standard drug susceptible H37Rv strain showed 100% concordance with real-time PCR results. DNA sequencing revealed the mutations at Ser531Leu, His526Asp of rpoB gene and Ser315Thr, Thr314Pro of katG gene in RIF and INH resistance cases. This real-time PCR assay that targets limited number of loci in a selected range ensures direct and rapid detection of MDR-TB in Indian settings. However, future studies for revalidation as well as refinement are required to break the limitations of MDR-TB detection.

10.1186_s12916_016_0610_x	What can we offer to 3 million MDRTB household contacts in 2016?	The diagnosis of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in any individual is the beginning of a prolonged and difficult therapeutic journey. It also marks the moment from which to begin consideration of how to manage close contacts. Preventive therapy for drug-susceptible latent tuberculosis infection has been demonstrated to be effective at reducing the risk of future disease; the stakes are higher when considering prevention of MDR-TB because treatment of active disease is more prolonged and toxic and much less effective. This has encouraged exploration of the potential utility of preventive therapy, with second-line agents, in reducing future incident drug-resistant TB. Three clinical trials of preventive therapy for contacts of patients with MDR-TB are starting in 2015/16; results will not be available until at least 2020, so what should be offered to exposed contacts in the interim? A recent policy brief, arising from a global consultation meeting of international experts, recommended preventive therapy based upon very limited available observational data. However the many known unknowns associated with this approach, include the high proportion of index-contact pairs with discordant drug susceptibility profiles and (even if susceptibilities are shared) the lack of data supporting the use of the selected agents in the treatment of latent infection (rather than active disease). It is important to acknowledge that the alternative to offering preventive therapy is not doing nothing. On the contrary, identified contacts should be maintained under close, active surveillance for 24 months, enabling early detection of active disease in the small proportion amongst whom this may occur. Such patients should benefit from less extensive disease at diagnosis and early access to individualized therapeutic regimens with improved treatment outcomes. Moreover the vast majority of contacts that do not develop disease will benefit from avoidance of potentially toxic, unnecessary therapy. Whether preventive therapy or close observation are implemented, national programmes should maintain a register of all contacts, interventions and 24 month outcomes; these will provide important performance metrics for programmatic management of MDRTB. If harmonized and standardized internationally, such a register could rapidly yield a wealth of observational data, to complement the trial results of the future.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0360	Re-inventing adherence: toward a patient-centered model of care for drug-resistant tuberculosis and HIV	BACKGROUND : Despite renewed focus on molecular tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics and new antimycobacterial agents, treatment outcomes for patients co-infected with drug-resistant TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remain dismal, in part due to lack of focus on medication adherence as part of a patient-centered continuum of care. OBJECTIVE: To review current barriers to drug-resistant TB-HIV treatment and propose an alternative model to conventional approaches to treatment support. DISCUSSION: Current national TB control programs rely heavily on directly observed therapy (DOT) as the centerpiece of treatment delivery and adherence support. Medication adherence and care for drug-resistant TB HIV could be improved by fully implementing team based patient-centered care, empowering patients through counseling and support, maintaining a rights based approach while acknowledging the responsibility of health care systems in providing comprehensive care, and prioritizing critical research gaps. CONCLUSION: It is time to re-invent our understanding of adherence in drug-resistant TB and HIV by focusing attention on the complex clinical, behavioral, social, and structural needs of affected patients and communities.	drug-resistant TB; HIV; medication adherence; patient-centered care	HOME-BASED TREATMENT; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; SOUTH-AFRICA; INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS; MDR-TB; FAILURE; EVOLUTION
10.5588_ijtld.15.0575	Characteristics and costs of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis inpatient care in the United States, 2005-2007	OBJECTIVE: A population-based study of 135 multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during 2005-2007 found 73% were hospitalized. We analyzed factors associated with hospitalization. METHODS: We assessed statistically significant multi variable associations with US in-patient TB diagnosis, frequency of hospitalization, length of hospital stay, and in-patient direct costs to the health care system. RESULTS: Of 98 hospitalized patients, 83 (85%) were foreign-born. Blacks, diabetics, or smokers were more likely, and patients with disseminated disease less likely, to receive their TB diagnosis while hospitalized. Patients aged >= 65 years, those with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), or with private insurance, were hospitalized more frequently. Excluding deaths, length of stay was greater for patients aged >= 65 years, those with extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), those residing in Texas, those with AIDS, those who were unemployed, or those who had TB resistant to all first-line medications vs. others. Average hospitalization cost per XDR-TB patient (US$285 000) was 3.5 times that per MDR-TB patient (US$81 000), in 2010 dollars. Hospitalization episode costs for MDR-TB rank third highest and those for XDR-TB highest among the principal diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization was common and remains a critical care component for patients who were older, had comorbidities, or required complex management due to XDR-TB. MDR-TB in-patient costs are among the highest for any disease.	TB; drug resistance; cost, hospitalization; HIV/AIDS	
10.5588_ijtld.15.0318	Discordance between patient and clinician reports of adverse reactions to MDR-TB treatment	SETTING: An urban out-patient clinic in Durban, South Africa, providing community-based treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). OBJECTIVE: To describe concordance between patient report and clinician documentation of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to treatment for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). DESIGN: ADRs were documented by interview using an 18-item symptom checklist and medical record data abstraction during a cross-sectional parent study with 121 MDR-TB patients, 75% of whom were co-infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. Concordance was analyzed using Cohen's kappa statistic, Gwet's agreement coefficient (AC) 1, and McNemar's test. RESULTS: ADRs were reported much more frequently in patient interviews (mu = 8.6) than in medical records (mu = 1.4). Insomnia was most common (67% vs. 2%), followed by peripheral neuropathy (65% vs. 18%), and confusion (61 vs. 4%). kappa scores were very low, with the highest degree of concordance found in hearing loss (kappa = 0.23), which was the only ADR not found to be significantly different between the two data sources (P = 0.34). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a lack of concordance between patient report and clinician documentation of ADRs. These findings indicate the need for improved documentation of ADRs to better reflect patients' experiences during MDR-TB treatment. These data have important implications for country-level pharmacovigilance programs that rely on clinician documentation of ADRs for MDR-TB policy formation.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0470	Evaluation of the direct nitrate reductase assay for rapid detection of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: Jiangxi, China. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of the direct nitrate reductase assay (D-NRA) for rapid, low-cost detection of multidrug-resistant (MDR-) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in high-burden, resource-limited settings. METHODS: A total of 225 smear-positive sputum samples were collected from consecutive drug-resistant TB subjects. Samples were processed at the Province TB Reference Laboratory and tested for susceptibility to rifampicin (RMP), isoniazid (INH), ofloxacin (OFX), kanamycin (KM) and capreomycin (CPM) by D-NRA, using the indirect Lowenstein-Jensen proportion method (LJ-PM) as reference. RESULTS : Of the 225 smear-positive sputum samples, 214 isolates were identified as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and analysed for further comparison. The sensitivity of the D-NRA in the detection of resistance to RMP, INH, OFX, KM and CPM was respectively 95.1% (97/102), 93.1% (135/145), 97.4% (76/78), 88.9% (40/45) and 90.6% (29/32); specificity was respectively 100% (112/112), 97.1% (67/69), 100% (136/136), 98.8% (167/169) and 96.7% (176/182). The median time to culture positivity was significantly shorter for NRA than for the indirect u-PM (14 days vs. 70 days, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: D-NRA showed high sensitivity and specificity in the rapid diagnosis of MDR- and XDR-TB in a high-burden, resource-limited setting.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0666	Treating children for drug-resistant tuberculosis in Tajikistan with Group 5 medications	BACKGROUND: Management of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) and pre-XDR-TB is challenging, as effective drugs are lacking. Group 5 anti-tuberculosis drugs have an unclear role in the treatment of drug-resistant TB, and in children the efficacy, safety and effects of long-term use are not well described. We present clinical outcomes and adverse effects of a cohort of children with XDR-TB or pre-XDR-TB treated with Group 5 drugs in Tajikistan. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of eight children treated with one or more of the Group 5 drugs available under the Tajikistan National TB Programme linezolid, amoxicillin-clavulanate, clofazimine and clarithromycin given in combination with first- and second-line drugs. Time to sputum culture conversion, clinical outcomes and adverse effects were evaluated. RESULTS : Two children were cured, one completed treatment, four achieved favourable interim outcomes and one died. Adverse effects attributable to linezolid that required drug cessation occurred in one child; adverse effects of the other Group 5 drugs were insignificant or absent, requiring no regimen changes. CONCLUSION: Group 5 drugs can contribute to effective regimens in children with XDR and pre-XDR-TB. With proper monitoring and aggressive management of adverse effects, their safety profile might be acceptable, even in long-term use.	linezolid; clofazimine; amoxicillin-clavulanate; neuropathy; MDR-TB	MULTIDRUG THERAPY; METAANALYSIS; PHARMACOKINETICS; CLOFAZIMINE; OUTCOMES; LEPROSY
10.1128_AAC.02941_15	Mycobacterium tuberculosis Mutations Associated with Reduced Susceptibility to Linezolid	Linezolid (LZD) has become increasingly important for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), but its mechanisms of resistance are not well characterized. We isolated 32 mutants of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with reduced susceptibility to LZD, which was accounted for by rrl and rplC mutations in almost equal proportions, causing lower and higher MICs, respectively. Our findings provide useful information for the rapid detection of LZD resistance for improved treatment of MDR-TB.		DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT
10.1183_13993003.02146_2015	Effectiveness and safety of meropenem/clavulanate-containing regimens in the treatment of MDR- and XDR-TB	No large study has ever evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of meropenem/clavulanate to treat multidrug-and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-and XDR-TB). The aim of this observational study was to evaluate the therapeutic contribution, effectiveness, safety and tolerability profile of meropenem/clavulanate added to a background regimen when treating MDR-and XDR-TB cases. Patients treated with a meropenem/clavulanate-containing regimen (n=96) showed a greater drug resistance profile than those exposed to a meropenem/clavulanate-sparing regimen (n=168): in the former group XDR-TB was more frequent (49% versus 6.0%, p<0.0001) and the median (interquartile range (IQR)) number of antibiotic resistances was higher (8 (6-9) versus 5 (4-6)). Patients were treated with a meropenem/clavulanate-containing regimen for a median (IQR) of 85 (49-156) days. No statistically significant differences were observed in the overall MDR-TB cohort and in the subgroups with and without the XDR-TB patients; in particular, sputum smear and culture conversion rates were similar in XDR-TB patients exposed to meropenem/clavulanate-containing regimens (88.0% versus 100.0%, p=1.00 and 88.0% versus 100.0%, p=1.00, respectively). Only six cases reported adverse events attributable to meropenem/clavulanate (four of them then restarting treatment). The nondifferent outcomes and bacteriological conversion rate observed in cases who were more severe than controls might imply that meropenem/clavulanate could be active in treating MDR-and XDR-TB cases.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0645	Use of Xpert (R) MTB/RIF assay in the first national anti-tuberculosis drug resistance survey in Pakistan	SETTING: The first national anti-tuberculosis drug resistance survey in Pakistan, a high tuberculosis (TB) and low human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) burden country. OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and to compare the performance of Xpert (R) MTB/RIF with conventional phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST). METHODS: Sputum samples were collected from 1972 consecutively enrolled pulmonary TB patients from 40 clusters. Phenotypic DST was performed in parallel with Xpert. RESULTS: The proportion of MDR-TB patients was 3.7% (95 %CI 2.5-5.0) among new and 18.1% (95 %CI 13.0-23.4) among previously treated cases. A valid rifampicin (RMP) testing result was available from substantially more cases with Xpert (n = 1809) than with phenotypic DST (n = 1592). Among strains with discordant results, rpoB sequencing revealed only one false-resistant result (new TB case) with Xpert and 7.7% (8/104) of RMP-resistant cases missed with Xpert against 3.8% (4/14) by phenotypic DST. This difference was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: This survey provides the first representative data for Pakistan on its MDR-TB burden. The Xpert assay had nearly 100% specificity, even in a low MDR-1B prevalence setting. The use of this assay greatly simplifies survey logistics, making it a feasible option for survey implementation, especially in resource-constrained settings.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; surveillance; MDR-TB; rifampicin	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE; RIFAMPIN RESISTANCE; RPOB MUTATIONS; TUBERCULOSIS; DIAGNOSIS; TESTS; TOOL
10.1371_journal.pone.0151724	Propensity Score-Based Approaches to Confounding by Indication in Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis: Non-Standardized Treatment for Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis	Background In the absence of randomized clinical trials, meta-analysis of individual patient data (IPD) from observational studies may provide the most accurate effect estimates for an intervention. However, confounding by indication remains an important concern that can be addressed by incorporating individual patient covariates in different ways. We compared different analytic approaches to account for confounding in IPD from patients treated for multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Methods Two antibiotic classes were evaluated, fluoroquinolones-considered the cornerstone of effective MDR-TB treatment-and macrolides, which are known to be safe, yet are ineffective in vitro. The primary outcome was treatment success against treatment failure, relapse or death. Effect estimates were obtained using multivariable and propensity-score based approaches. Results Fluoroquinolone antibiotics were used in 28 included studies, within which 6,612 patients received a fluoroquinolone and 723 patients did not. Macrolides were used in 15 included studies, within which 459 patients received this class of antibiotics and 3,670 did not. Both standard multivariable regression and propensity score-based methods resulted in similar effect estimates for early and late generation fluoroquinolones, while macrolide antibiotics use was associated with reduced treatment success. Conclusions In this individual patient data meta-analysis, standard multivariable and propensity-score based methods of adjusting for individual patient covariates for observational studies yielded produced similar effect estimates. Even when adjustment is made for potential confounding, interpretation of adjusted estimates must still consider the potential for residual bias.

10.1371_journal.pone.0152507	Imaging Features of Pulmonary CT in Type 2 Diabetic Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Background Until now, radiographic manifestations of multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have not been reported. We conducted a study to investigate the imaging features of pulmonary computed tomography (CT) for type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients with MDR-TB. Methods The clinical data and pulmonary CT findings of 39 type 2 diabetic patients with MDR-TB, 46 type 2 diabetic patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB), and 72 pure drug-susceptible TB cases (without T2DM and MDR) treated at Dalian Tuberculosis Hospital from 2012 to 2015 were collected, and the clinical features and imaging differences of the three groups were compared. Results The clinical characteristics of the three groups of patients were not significantly different except with respect to age and previous treatment history. However, on imaging, the patients with MDR-TB showed consolidation in and above the pulmonary segments was significantly more extensive than that seen in the DS-TB group with or without T2DM. Conclusion Consolidation in or above multiple pulmonary segments with multiple mouth-eaten cavities and bronchial damage on pulmonary CT images in type 2 diabetic patients with tuberculosis suggests the possibility of multi-drug resistance.

10.1371_journal.pone.0152283	"My Favourite Day Is Sunday"": Community Perceptions of (Drug-Resistant) Tuberculosis and Ambulatory Tuberculosis Care in Kara Suu District, Osh Province, Kyrgyzstan"	Objectives Kyrgyzstan is one of the 27 high multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) burden countries listed by the WHO. In 2012, Medecins Sans FrontiSres (MSF) started a drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) project in Kara Suu District. A qualitative study was undertaken to understand the perception of TB and DR-TB in order to improve the effectiveness and acceptance of the MSF intervention and to support advocacy strategies for an ambulatory model of care. Methods This paper reports findings from 63 interviews with patients, caregivers, health care providers and members of communities. Data was analysed using a qualitative content analysis. Validation was ensured by triangulation and a 'thick' description of the research context, and by presenting deviant cases. Results Findings show that the general population interprets TB as the 'lungs having a cold' or as a 'family disease' rather than as an infectious illness. From their perspective, individuals facing poor living conditions are more likely to get TB than wealthier people. Vulnerable groups such as drug and alcohol users, homeless persons, ethnic minorities and young women face barriers in accessing health care. As also reported in other publications, TB is highly stigmatised and possible side effects of the long treatment course are seen as unbearable; therefore, people only turn to public health care quite late. Most patients prefer ambulatory treatment because of the much needed emotional support from their social environment, which positively impacts treatment concordance. Health care providers favour inpatient treatment only for a better monitoring of side effects. Health staff increasingly acknowledges the central role they play in supporting DR-TB patients, and the importance of assuming a more empathic attitude. Conclusions Health promotion activities should aim at improving knowledge on TB and DR-TB, reducing stigma, and fostering the inclusion of vulnerable populations. Health seeking delays and adherence problems will be countered by further implementation of shortened treatment regimens. An ambulatory model of care is proposed when convenient for the patient; hospitalisation is favoured only when seen as more appropriate for the respective individual.

10.1186_s12916_016_0576_8	Rationing tests for drug-resistant tuberculosis - who are we prepared to miss?	Background: Early identification of patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) increases the likelihood of treatment success and interrupts transmission. Resource-constrained settings use risk profiling to ration the use of drug susceptibility testing (DST). Nevertheless, no studies have yet quantified how many patients with DR-TB this strategy will miss. Methods: A total of 1,545 subjects, who presented to Lima health centres with possible TB symptoms, completed a clinic-epidemiological questionnaire and provided sputum samples for TB culture and DST. The proportion of drug resistance in this population was calculated and the data was analysed to demonstrate the effect of rationing tests to patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) risk factors on the number of tests needed and corresponding proportion of missed patients with DR-TB. Results: Overall, 147/1,545 (9.5 %) subjects had culture-positive TB, of which 32 (21.8 %) had DR-TB (MDR, 13.6 %; isoniazid mono-resistant, 7.5 %; rifampicin mono-resistant, 0.7 %). A total of 553 subjects (35.8 %) reported one or more MDR-TB risk factors; of these, 506 (91.5 %; 95 % CI, 88.9-93.7 %) did not have TB, 32/553 (5.8 %; 95 % CI, 3.4-8.1 %) had drug-susceptible TB, and only 15/553 (2.7 %; 95 % CI, 1.5-4.4 %) had DR-TB. Rationing DST to those with an MDR-TB risk factor would have missed more than half of the DR-TB population (17/32, 53.2 %; 95 % CI, 34.7-70.9). Conclusions: Rationing DST based on known MDR-TB risk factors misses an unacceptable proportion of patients with drug-resistance in settings with ongoing DR-TB transmission. Investment in diagnostic services to allow universal DST for people with presumptive TB should be a high priority.

10.1371_journal.pone.0149806	The Burden of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Papua New Guinea: Results of a Large Population-Based Survey	Background Reliable estimates of the burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are crucial for effective control and prevention of tuberculosis (TB). Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a high TB burden country with limited information on the magnitude of the MDR-TB problem. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in four PNG provinces: Madang, Morobe, National Capital District and Western Province. Patient sputum samples were tested for rifampicin resistance by the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and those showing the presence of resistance underwent phenotypic susceptibility testing to first-and second-line anti-TB drugs including streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, ofloxacin, amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin. Results Among 1,182 TB patients enrolled in the study, MDR-TB was detected in 20 new (2.7%; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.1-4.3%) and 24 previously treated (19.1%; 95% CI: 8.5-29.8%) TB cases. No case of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) was detected. Thirty percent (6/20) of new and 33.3%(8/24) of previously treated cases with MDR-TB were detected in a single cluster in Western Province. Conclusion In PNG the proportion of MDR-TB in new cases is slightly lower than the regional average of 4.4% (95% CI: 2.6-6.3%). A large proportion of MDR-TB cases were identified from a single hospital in Western Province, suggesting that the prevalence of MDR-TB across the country is heterogeneous. Future surveys should further explore this finding. The survey also helped strengthening the use of smear microscopy and Xpert MTB/RIF testing as diagnostic tools for TB in the country.

10.1371_journal.pone.0151303	Epidemiology and Clinical Characteristics of Pediatric Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Chongqing, China	To gain insight into the epidemiology of childhood drug resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) in China that has the second largest burden of TB and the largest number of multidrug resistant (MDR) TB cases in the world, we performed the cross-sectional study to investigate drug resistance of four first-line anti-TB drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin and ethambutol) using Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from 196 culture-confirmed pediatric TB cases diagnosed in the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, China during 2008-2013. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between patient demographic and clinical characteristics and DR- and MDR-TB, respectively. Twenty-eight percent (56/196) of the study patients exhibited resistance to at least one of the four first-line anti-TB drugs tested. MDR was found in 4.6% (9/196) of the study patients. More than half (5/9, 55.6%) of the MDR cases were from a single county of Chongqing. A significant association was found between being acid-fast bacilli-smear negative and DR-TB (adjusted OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.13-4.80) and between having concurrent thoracic-extrathoracic involvement and MDR-TB (adjusted OR, 9.49; 95% CI, 1.05-85.92), respectively. The findings of this study indicate that the rate of DR is high among pediatric TB patients in Chongqing and suggest an urgent need for studies to identify MDR transmission hotspots in Chongqing, thereby contributing to the control DR- and MDR-TB epidemics in China. The study also generates new insight into the pathogenesis of DR and MDR M. tuberculosis strains and highlights the importance of studying childhood TB to the goal of global TB control.

10.1371_journal.pone.0150849	"When Treatment Is More Challenging than the Disease"": A Qualitative Study of MDR-TB Patient Retention"	Background One-fifth of the patients on multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment at the Drug-Resistant-TB (DR-TB) Site in Gujarat are lost-to-follow-up(LFU). Objective To understand patients' and providers' perspectives on reasons for LFU and their suggestions to improve retention-in-care. Design Qualitative study conducted between December 2013-March 2014, including in-depth interviews with LFU patients and DOT-providers, and a focus group discussion with DR-TB site supervisors. A thematic-network analysis approach was utilised. Results Three sub-themes emerged: (i) Struggle with prolonged treatment; (ii) Strive against stigma and toward support; (iii) Divergent perceptions and practices. Daily injections, pill burden, DOT, migratory work, social problems, prior TB treatment, and adverse drugs effects were reported as major barriers to treatment adherence and retention-in-care by patients and providers. Some providers felt that despite their best efforts, LFU patients remain. Patient movements between private practitioners and traditional healers further influenced LFU. Conclusion The study points to a need for repeated patient counselling and education, improved coordination between various tiers of providers engaged in DR-TB care, collaboration between the public, private and traditional practitioners, and promotion of social and economic support to help patients adhere to MDR-TB treatment and avoid LFU.

10.1371_journal.pone.0144249	Tuberculosis Case Fatality and Other Causes of Death among Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients in a High HIV Prevalence Setting, 2000-2008, South Africa	Introduction South Africa has the highest reported rates of multi-drug resistant TB in Africa, typified by poor treatment outcomes, attributable mainly to high default and death rates. Concomitant HIV has become the strongest predictor of death among MDR-TB patients, while anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically reduced mortality. TB Case fatality rate (CFR) is an indicator that specifically reports on deaths due to TB. Aim The aim of this paper was to investigate causes of death amongst MDR-TB patients, the contribution of conditions other than TB to deaths, and to determine if causes differ between HIV-uninfected patients, HIV-infected patients receiving ART and those without ART. Methods We carried out a retrospective review of data captured from the register of the MDR-TB programme of the North West Province, South Africa. We included 671 patients treated between 2000-2008; 59% of the cohort was HIV-infected and 33% had received ART during MDR treatment. The register contained data on treatment outcomes and causes of death. Results Treatment outcomes between HIV-uninfected cases, HIV-infected cases receiving ART and HIV-infected without ART differed significantly (p < 0.000). The cohort death rate was 24%, 13% for HIV-uninfected cases and 31% for HIV-infected cases. TB caused most of the deaths, resulting in a cohort CFR of 15%, 9% for HIV-uninfected cases and 20% for HIV-infected cases. Cohort mortality rate due to other conditions was 2%. AIDS-conditions rather than TB caused significantly more deaths among HIV-infected cases receiving ART than those not (p = 0.02). Conclusions The deaths among HIV-infected individuals contribute substantially to the high death rate. ART co-therapy protected HIV-infected cases from death due to TB and AIDS-conditions. Mechanisms need to be in place to ensure that HIV-infected individuals are retained in care upon completion of their MDR-TB treatment.		MORTALITY; OUTCOMES; THERAPY
10.1128_mSphere.00043_15	Targeting Drug-Sensitive and -Resistant Strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by Inhibition of Src Family Kinases Lowers Disease Burden and Pathology	In view of emerging drug resistance among bacterial pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the development of novel therapeutic strategies is increasingly being sought. A recent paradigm in antituberculosis (anti-TB) drug development is to target the host molecules that are crucial for intracellular survival of the pathogen. We previously showed the importance of Src tyrosine kinases in mycobacterial pathogenesis. Here, we report that inhibition of Src significantly reduced survival of H37Rv as well as multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extremely drug-resistant (XDR) strains of M. tuberculosis in THP-1 macrophages. Src inhibition was also effective in controlling M. tuberculosis infection in guinea pigs. In guinea pigs, reduced M. tuberculosis burden due to Src inhibition also led to a marked decline in the disease pathology. In agreement with the theoretical framework of host-directed approaches against the pathogen, Src inhibition was equally effective against an XDR strain in controlling infection in guinea pigs. We propose that Src inhibitors could be developed into effective host-directed anti-TB drugs, which could be indiscriminately used against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. IMPORTANCE The existing treatment regimen for tuberculosis (TB) suffers from deficiencies like high doses of antibiotics, long treatment duration, and inability to kill persistent populations in an efficient manner. Together, these contribute to the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Recently, several host factors were identified which help intracellular survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis within the macrophage. These factors serve as attractive targets for developing alternate therapeutic strategies against M. tuberculosis. This strategy promises to be effective against drugresistant strains. The approach also has potential to considerably lower the risk of emergence of new drug-resistant strains. We explored tyrosine kinase Src as a host factor exploited by virulent M. tuberculosis for intracellular survival. We show that Src inhibition can effectively control tuberculosis in infected guinea pigs. Moreover, Src inhibition ameliorated TB-associated pathology in guinea pigs. Thus, Src inhibitors have strong potential to be developed as possible anti-TB drugs.	adjunct therapy; host-directed therapy; MDR-TB; XDR-TB	FOCAL ADHESION KINASE; NF-KAPPA-B; TYROSINE KINASES; HUMAN MACROPHAGES; AUTOPHAGY; ACTIVATION; PATHWAYS; AKT; ABL; LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE
10.4103_0971_5916.182625	A study on pre-XDR & XDR tuberculosis & their prevalent genotypes in clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in north India	Background & objectives: Pre-extensively drug resistant (pre-XDR) and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) have been areas of growing concern, and are posing threat to global etiorts of TB control. The present study was planned to study the presence of pre-XDR and XDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis and their genotypes in clinical isolates obtained from previously treated cases of pulmonary TB. Methods: A total of 219 isolates obtained from previously treated cases of pulmonary TB were subjected to first-line (streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol) and second-line (ofloxacin, kanamycin, capreomycin and amikacin) drug susceptibility testing on solid Lowenstein-Jensen medium by proportion method. Genotyping was done for pre-XDR and XDR-TB isolates using 12 loci Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units-Variable Number Tandem Repeats (MIRU-VNTR). Results: Multi-drug resistance was observed in 39.7 per cent (87/219) isolates. Pre-XDR and XDR M. tuberculosis isolates amongst 87 multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB isolates were 43 (49.4%) and 10 (11.4%), respectively. Two most dominant genotypes among pre-XDR and XDR M. tuberculosis isolates were Beijing and Delhi/CAS types. Interpretation & conclusions: Resistance to second-line anti-tubercular drugs should be routinely assessed in areas endemic for TB. Similar genotype patterns were seen in pre-XDR and XDR-TB isolates. Beijing and Delhi/CAS were predominant genotypes.	MDR-TB; MIRU-VNTR; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; pre-XDR-TB; XDR-TB	DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; OFLOXACIN; CHINA; DELHI; MDR
10.3390_s16030376	Accurate Detection of Rifampicin-Resistant Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Strains	In 2013 alone, the death rate among the 9.0 million people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) worldwide was around 14%, which is unacceptably high. An empiric treatment of patients infected with TB or drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strain can also result in the spread of MDR-TB. The diagnostic tools which are rapid, reliable, and have simple experimental protocols can significantly help in decreasing the prevalence rate of MDR-TB strain. We report the evaluation of the 9G technology based 9G DNAChips that allow accurate detection and discrimination of TB and MDR-TB-RIF. One hundred and thirteen known cultured samples were used to evaluate the ability of 9G DNAChip in the detection and discrimination of TB and MDR-TB-RIF strains. Hybridization of immobilized probes with the PCR products of TB and MDR-TB-RIF strains allow their detection and discrimination. The accuracy of 9G DNAChip was determined by comparing its results with sequencing analysis and drug susceptibility testing. Sequencing analysis showed 100% agreement with the results of 9G DNAChip. The 9G DNAChip showed very high sensitivity (95.4%) and specificity (100%).	sensitivity; accuracy; drug-resistant tuberculosis; tuberculosis; specificity; diagnosis	GENEXPERT MTB/RIF ASSAY; MULTIPLEX SNP DETECTION; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; RAPID DETECTION; RPOB GENE; DRUG; MUTATIONS; DIAGNOSIS; PLATFORM; SYSTEM
10.1016_j.tube.2015.11.007	Comparison of the socio-demographic and clinical features of pulmonary TB patients infected with sub-lineages within the W-Beijing and non-Beijing Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Background: Highly lethal outbreaks of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis are increasing. Mycobacterium tuberculosis variant Beijing family and its members is regarded as a successful clone of M. tuberculosis that is associated with drug resistance in China. Understanding the genetic characteristics and molecular mechanism of drug resistant tuberculosis within Beijing family may help to clarify its origin and evolutionary history and the driving forces behind its emergence and current dissemination. Methods: Totally of 1222 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were recovered from patients in six counties of two provinces in eastern China within 2010/2012. Strain lineage and its major subgroups were studied respectively by using Spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR The 1st-line drug susceptibility was analyzed by proportional method and 2nd-line drug susceptibility was determined by the HAINs MTBDRsI test. The genetic characterization of drug resistance was analyzed by sequencing the previously reported genes and loci associated with drug resistance together with the multiple genotyping including MIRU-VNTR, Spoligotyping and LSP genotyping. Results: Of the 1222 Mtb isolates, 298 (24.4%) were resistant to 1st-line drug and 73 (5.9%) were simultaneously resistant to INH and RIF namely MDR-TB. Respectively 23.8% of 1st-line drug resistant TB and 12.0% of the drug susceptible TB contained the mutation associated with 2nd-line drugs by HAINs test. The Spoligotyping of 1222 Mtb isolates revealed the 967 (79.1%) of the isolates belonged to the W-Beijing family. Within W-Beijing family, 78.8% MDR-TB were observed in the isolates with simultaneous deletion of RD105 and RD207, with sub-lineage 181 accounting for 75% of MDR-TB. Analysis of 24 MIRU-VNTR loci revealed that 88.2% (15/17) of MDR and extensively drug resistant (XDR) clustered isolates were sub-lineage 181. Conclusions: Sublineage 181 might have the capacity to spread throughout the general community in rural China. This is the first report on the extensive association of sub-lineage 181 with MDR TB and possibly pre-XDR TB and XDR TB. It is important to monitor sublineage 181 to verify its heightened transmission and understand its importance in the global MDR TB and XDR TB epidemics. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.1016_j.tube.2015.12.003	Identification of a novel inhibitor of isocitrate lyase as a potent antitubercular agent against both active and non-replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Objective: Screen and identify novel inhibitors of isocitrate lyase (ICL) as potent antitubercular agents against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and determine their inhibitory characteristics, antitubercular activities and mechanisms of action. Methods: Recombinant ICL of M. tuberculosis was expressed and purified, which was used for high-throughput screening (HTS) and the following experiments. A total of 71,765 compounds were screened to identify ICL inhibitors which were then evaluated for their roles as potent antitubercular agents. To determine the inhibitory characteristics of the agents against latent M. tuberculosis in persistent infections, a macrophage model (mouse J774A.1 cell) infected with Mycobacterium marinum BAA-535 strain was built and assessed. The potent antitubercular agents were identified using the macrophage model. Then, the inhibitory intensity and mode of the agents that exhibit on ICL protein of M. tuberculosis were analyzed, and the interaction mechanisms were preliminarily clarified according to the parameters of enzyme kinetics, circular dichroism experiments, fluorescence quenching assay, and molecular docking. Results: The previously established ICL inhibitor screening model was evaluated to be suitable for HTS assay. Of the 71,765 compounds, 13 of them were identified to inhibit ICL effectively and stably. IMBI-3 demonstrated the most significant inhibitory activity with IC50 of 30.9 mu mol/L. Its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for M. tuberculosis, including extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), were determined in the range of 0.25-1 mu g/mL. When IMBI-3 is used in combination with isoniazid, the colony-forming units (CFU) counting of latent M. tuberculosis in J774A.1 macrophage cells decreased significantly as IMB1-3 concentration increased. The inhibition mode of IMBI-3 on ICL was probably competitive inhibition with an inhibition constant (K-i) of approximate 1.85 mu mol/L. The interaction between IMBI-3 and ICL of M. tuberculosis was also confirmed by circular dichroism experiments and fluorescence quenching assay. And seven possible active amino acids of ICL of M. tuberculosis were identified in the active site through molecular docking. Conclusion: IMBI-3, a novel potent antitubercular agent targeting ICL of M. tuberculosis, was identified and evaluated. It inhibited both log-phase M. tuberculosis in vitro and dormant M. tuberculosis in macrophages. It was the first representative compound of this family with the ICL enzyme inhibition and antimycobacterial activities. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.1016_j.clinthera.2016.01.023	Cost-effectiveness of Bedaquiline for the Treatment of Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis in the Republic of Korea	Purpose: Bedaquiline is a new drug used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding bedaquiline to a standard regimen (SR) for treating patients with MDR-TB, including extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB, in the Republic of Korea. Methods: A cohort-based decision-analytic model developed in a previously published study from the United Kingdom was used, with a 20-year time horizon and a 5% discount rate for cost and effectiveness, to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of bedaquiline + SR and SR only. The key parameters regarding the clinical data were available via the published Phase II trial of bedaquiline. Additional parameters for recurrence, cure status, loss to follow-up, surgery, death, cost, and health utility were based on Korean data if available; otherwise the international literature data were applied. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Findings: Based on the analysis, a patient on bedaquiline + SR would gain 1.20 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at 13,961,659 Korean won (KRW) (1100 KRW = US $1) of additional cost compared with a patient administered SR only, with an incremental cost/utility ratio of 11,638,656 KRW/QALY. Bedaquiline + SR had an 80% probability of being cost-effective, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 26 million KRW, compared with SR only. Implications: The results of this study suggest that, in the Republic of Korea, bedaquiline, as a part of combination therapy with SR, is a cost-effective option for the treatment of MDR-TB (including XDR-TB) compared with SR only.

10.1093_ejcts_ezv228	A retrospective review comparing treatment outcomes of adjuvant lung resection for drug-resistant tuberculosis in patients with and without human immunodeficiency virus co-infection	This review was undertaken to compare treatment outcomes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative versus HIV-positive patients following adjuvant lung resection for drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) in patients deemed feasible for surgery. Despite appropriate medical therapy, mortality remains extremely high and cure rates poor in patients with DR-TB and HIV co-infection. Therefore, adjuvant lung resection may warrant a more prominent role in the treatment of these patients. A retrospective review of all case records from 1 January 2012 to 31 March 2013 of all patients admitted to the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery King Dinuzulu Hospital with DR-TB and treated with adjuvant lung resection was undertaken. Prior to surgery, all patients were treated for at least 3 months with appropriate drug therapy for DR-TB. This was continued for the recommended period following lung resection. Fourteen patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) were deemed suitable for lung resection. Of these patients, 10 patients were HIV-positive and 4 were HIV-negative. In the XDR-TB/HIV-positive group, 7 patients were cured, 2 converted and 2 patients developed a post-pneumonectomy broncho-pleural fistula. One patient was lost to follow-up. In the XDR-TB/HIV-negative group, 1 patient was cured, 3 converted and 1 patient developed a post-thoracotomy superficial wound infection. There was no in-hospital mortality in both groups. Thirty-six patients with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were deemed suitable for lung resection. Of these patients, 19 were HIV-positive and 17 HIV-negative. In the MDR-TB/HIV-positive group, 12 patients were cured and 6 converted. One patient developed a post-thoracotomy superficial wound infection and another patient who developed a post-pneumonectomy empyema thoracis was also regarded as a treatment failure. In the MDR-TB/HIV-negative group, 15 patients were cured, 2 converted and 1 patient developed a post-pneumonectomy lower respiratory tract infection which necessitated a short period of mechanical ventilation. There was no in-hospital mortality in both groups. Lung resection for DR-TB may be safely undertaken in selected patients who are HIV-positive with cure rates equivalent to that of HIV-negative patients. More importantly, these patients also have significantly higher cure rates than those patients treated with medical therapy alone.

10.1093_jac_dkv407	Time to detection in liquid culture of sputum in pulmonary MDR-TB does not predict culture conversion for early discharge	UK guidelines advise that patients with pulmonary MDR-TB are isolated in hospital until the results of sputum cultures are negative (culture conversion), typically after 42 days of incubation with no growth. MDR-TB patients may be isolated a parts per thousand yen42 days longer than is necessary for public safety, which has major implications for patients and hospitals. Our objective was to determine whether analysis of time to detection (TTD) in liquid culture could predict the earliest safe discharge date of MDR-TB patients. Fifteen pulmonary MDR-TB patients were identified retrospectively from the London TB Register and hospital records. We performed linear regression of TTD against days elapsed between admission and sample date. If the regression line crossed the observed culture-conversion date at TTDaEuroS=aEuroS42 days, the data were deemed to give 'precise prediction' of the earliest safe discharge date. The median length of stay was 91 days (IQR 79-131 days). Culture conversion occurred at a median of 59 days (IQR 46-86 days). Twelve patients were hospitalized beyond culture conversion, with a median overstay of 52 days (IQR 35-68 days). TTD tended to lengthen until culture conversion and, for nearly half of the patients (7/15, 47%), linear regression of TTD against time from admission gave a good fit to the data (r(2)aEuroSa parts per thousand yenaEuroS0.6) and supported precise prediction. However, data from the remaining patients showed considerable variation, and linear regression did not support prediction of safe discharge. TTD data from these pulmonary MDR-TB patients did not support a simple clinical prediction tool, but our analysis was limited by the small size of our sample.		TUBERCULOSIS
10.1016_j.jiac.2015.12.009	Genotypic characterization of multi-drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in Myanmar	The number of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases is rising worldwide. As a countermeasure against this situation, the implementation of rapid molecular tests to identify MDR-TB would be effective. To develop such tests, information on the frequency and distribution of mutations associating with phenotypic drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is required in each country. During 2010, the common mutations in the rpoB, katG and inhA of 178 phenotypically MDR M. tuberculosis isolates collected by the National Tuberculosis Control Program (NTP) in Myanmar were investigated by DNA sequencing. Mutations affecting the 81-bp rifampicin (RIF) resistance-determining region (RRDR) of the rpoB were identified in 127 of 178 isolates (71.3%). Two of the most frequently affected codons were 531 and 526, with percentages of 48.3% and 14.0% respectively. For isoniazid (INH) resistance, 114 of 178 MDR-TB isolates (64.0%) had mutations in the katG in which a mutation-conferring amino acid substitution at codon 315 from Ser to Thr was the most common. Mutations in the inhA regulatory region were also detected in 20 (11.2%) isolates, with the majority at position -15. Distinct mutation rate and pattern from surrounding countries might suggest that MDR-TB has developed and spread domestically in Myanmar.

10.1016_j.jgar.2015.11.006	Impact of diabetes mellitus on tuberculosis drug resistance in new cases of tuberculosis	The objectives of this study were to determine the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on antituberculosis drug resistance in new cases of tuberculosis (TB). A case-control study was conducted on all newly diagnosed pulmonary TB adult patients with DM as cases and without DM as controls who were hospitalised from May 2013 to October 2013 in Iran. A molecular resistance test for rapid detection of resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin was done. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the impact of DM on any anti-TB drug resistance. In total, 62 TB cases with DM and 64 TB cases without DM were included. TB cases with DM were more likely to be older (59 years vs. 43 years; P = 0.001). Two TB-DM patients had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) (3.2%) compared with no cases of MDR-TB in the control group, and more TB-DM cases had isolates that were resistant to at least one drug (12.9% vs. 10.9%). DM [odds ratio (OR) = 4.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1-23.57], age < 40 years (OR = 5.48, 95% CI 1.19-25.29) and history of TB contact (OR = 5.86, 95% CI 1.69-20.36) remained significantly associated with any drug resistance in the multivariate analysis. In conclusion, new TB patients with DM are at increased risk of anti-TB drug resistance. More studies are needed to confirm these results.

10.1371_journal.pone.0150487	Comparing Tuberculosis Diagnostic Yield in Smear/Culture and Xpert (R) MTB/RIF-Based Algorithms Using a Non-Randomised Stepped-Wedge Design	Setting Primary health services in Cape Town, South Africa. Study Aim To compare tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic yield in an existing smear/culture-based and a newly introduced Xpert (R) MTB/RIF-based algorithm. Methods TB diagnostic yield (the proportion of presumptive TB cases with a laboratory diagnosis of TB) was assessed using a non-randomised stepped-wedge design as sites transitioned to the Xpert (R) based algorithm. We identified the full sequence of sputum tests recorded in the electronic laboratory database for presumptive TB cases from 60 primary health sites during seven one-month time-points, six months apart. Differences in TB yield and temporal trends were estimated using a binomial regression model. Results TB yield was 20.9% (95% CI 19.9% to 22.0%) in the smear/culture-based algorithm compared to 17.9% (95% CI 16.4% to 19.5%) in the Xpert (R) based algorithm. There was a decline in TB yield over time with a mean risk difference of -0.9% (95% CI -1.2% to -0.6%) (p<0.001) per time-point. When estimates were adjusted for the temporal trend, TB yield was 19.1% (95% CI 17.6% to 20.5%) in the smear/culture-based algorithm compared to 19.3% (95% CI 17.7% to 20.9%) in the Xpert (R) based algorithm with a risk difference of 0.3% (95% CI -1.8% to 2.3%) (p = 0.796). Culture tests were undertaken for 35.5% of smear-negative compared to 17.9% of Xpert (R) negative low MDR-TB risk cases and for 82.6% of smear-negative compared to 40.5% of Xpert (R) negative high MDR- TB risk cases in respective algorithms. Conclusion Introduction of an Xpert (R) based algorithm did not produce the expected increase in TB diagnostic yield. Studies are required to assess whether improving adherence to the Xpert (R) negative algorithm for HIV-infected individuals will increase yield. In light of the high cost of Xpert (R), a review of its role as a screening test for all presumptive TB cases may be warranted.

10.1007_s00253_015_7210_0	Rapid drug susceptibility test of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using microscopic time-lapse imaging in an agarose matrix	Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health problem, and multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) are spreading throughout the world. However, conventional drug susceptibility test (DST) methods, which rely on the detection of the colony formation on a solid medium, require 1-2 months to the result. A rapid and accurate DST is necessary to identify patients with drug-resistant TB and treat them with appropriate drugs. Here, we used microscopic imaging of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) immobilized in an agarose matrix for a rapid DST. The agarose matrix, which was molded in a microfluidic chip, was inoculated with MTB, and TB drugs in liquid culture medium diffused throughout the agarose to reach the MTB immobilized in the agarose matrix. After the responses of MTB to drugs were tracked with an automated microscopic system, an image-processing program automatically determined the susceptibility and resistance of MTB to specific doses of TB drugs. The automatic DST system was able to assess the drug susceptibility of various drug-resistant clinical TB strains within 9 days with an accuracy comparable to that of conventional method. Our rapid DST method based on microscopic time-lapse imaging greatly reduces the time required for a DST and can be used to rapidly and accurately treat TB patients.

10.1016_j.diagmicrobio.2015.10.017	Pyrazinamide resistance among multidrug-resistant tuberculosis clinical isolates in a national referral center of China and its correlations with pncA, rpsA, and panD gene mutations	Our study was aimed to identify the phenotypic and genotypic pyrazinamide (PZA) resistance features among multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates in a national tuberculosis (TB) referral center of China. PZA susceptibility test was performed for a total of 142 MDR-TB clinical isolates using the MGIT 960 PZA kits, and the pncA, rpsA, and panD genes were sequenced. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and pre-XDR strains had higher PZA resistance rate than that of MDR strains which were still sensitive to fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside (42.9%, 24/56) (chi(2) = 8.922, P = 0.012). No panD mutation was detected among the PZA resistant strains with wild type pncA and rpsA genes. Our study indicates that PZA-resistant frequency increases with TB drug resistance level; pncA, rpsA, and panD mutations had strong, low, and no correlation with PZA resistance, and rapid molecular assay will facilitate the timely identification of the PZA-sensitive MDR-TB.

10.3201_eid2203.141971	Use of Transnational Services to Prevent Treatment Interruption in Tuberculosis-Infected Persons Who Leave the United States	A major problem resulting from interrupted tuberculosis (TB) treatment is the development of drug-resistant TB, including multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB), a more deadly and costly to-treat form of the disease. Global health systems are not equipped to diagnose and treat the current burden of MDR TB. TB-infected foreign visitors and temporary US residents who leave the country during treatment can experience treatment interruption and, thus, are at greater risk for drug-resistant TB. Using epidemiologic and demographic data, we estimated TB incidence among this group, as well as the proportion of patients referred to transnational care continuity and management services during relocation; each year, 22,827 visitors and temporary residents are at risk for TB treatment interruption, 222 (8%) of whom are referred for transnational services. Scale up of transnational services for persons at high risk for treatment interruption is possible and encouraged because of potential health gains and reductions in healthcare costs for the United States and receiving countries.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0637	Direct tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing: time-saving and cost-effective in detecting MDR-TB	BACKGROUND: Recent advances have made molecular diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) and drug susceptibility testing (DST) possible, but the high costs involved present a huge challenge. The refinement and improvement of affordable methods therefore remain a priority. Conventional indirect DST is inexpensive and reliable, but time-consuming. A direct DST method for the direct testing of sputum samples without culture has been developed to reduce the time required for DST, but there have been conflicting results. METHODS AND RESULTS: Direct and indirect DST against isoniazid and rifampicin were performed on 208 sputum smear-positive specimens, 186 from newly diagnosed patients and 22 from previously treated patients; respectively 169 and 180 of the direct and indirect DST results were reportable. In comparison with indirect DST, direct DST resulted in a saving of on average 10.5 days. The time to direct DST results was inversely correlated with the number of acid-fast bacilli in the sputum samples. CONCLUSION: Direct DST is highly sensitive, reliable, cost-effective and time-saving in comparison with indirect DST.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant TB; DR-TB; DST; rifampicin; isoniazid	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; RAPID DETECTION; GLOBAL BURDEN; METAANALYSIS; DIAGNOSTICS; ASSAY; GENEXPERT; COUNTRIES; CHINA
10.5588_ijtld.15.0433	Presumptive treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in household contacts	SETTING: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a growing global health threat that often requires presumptive treatment in the absence of drug susceptibility testing (DST) results. OBJECTIVE: To compare two approaches to the treatment of MDR-TB contacts with no DST results who develop TB disease. DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults treated for TB disease who were contacts of patients living with MDR-TB. Subjects had been treated according to one of two presumptive treatment strategies: 1) regimens containing exclusively first-line drugs, and 2) regimens that included both first-and second-line drugs that were adjusted if and when DST results became available. The primary endpoint was a composite of death and treatment failure. RESULTS: Household contacts of MDR-TB patients who developed TB disease and were treated with first line regimens were significantly more likely to experience unfavorable end-of-treatment outcomes than those treated with presumptive MDR-TB regimens (RR 2.88, 95 %CI 1.24-6.68). CONCLUSION: Household contacts of MDR-TB patients who develop TB disease but have no DST results should receive regimens containing second-line drugs selected based on the infecting strain of the index patient. Regimens containing only first -line anti-tuber-culosis drugs significantly increase the risk of unfavorable outcomes.	drug resistance; individualized; programmatic management; recurrence	METAANALYSIS
10.3201_eid2203.151227	Decreased Time to Treatment Initiation for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients after Use of Xpert MTB/RIF Test, Latvia	Few studies have examined whether the Xpert MTB/RIF test improves time to treatment initiation for persons with multi drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). We determined the impact of this test in Latvia, where it was introduced in 2010. After descriptive analyses of pulmonary MDR TB patients in Latvia during 2009-2012, time to treatment initiation was calculated, and univariate and multivariable accelerated failure time models were constructed. Univariate results showed strong evidence of an association between having rifampinresistant TB detected by Xpert MTB/RIF and reduced time to treatment initiation versus the test not being used. A multivariable model stratifying by previous TB showed similar results. Our finding that in Latvia, time to treatment initiation was decreased for MDR TB cases that were rifampin-resistant TB by XpertMTB/RIF has implications for the use of this test in other settings with a high burden of MDR TB in which rifampin resistance is highly predictive of MDR TB.

10.3201_eid2203.151788	Factors Associated with Loss to Follow-up during Treatment for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis, the Philippines, 2012-2014	To identify factors associated with loss to follow-up during treatment for multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) in the Philippines, we conducted a case control study of adult patients who began receiving treatment for rifampin-resistant TB during July 1 December 31, 2012. Among 91 case-patients (those lost to follow-up) and 182 control-patients (those who adhered to treatment), independent factors associated with loss to follow-up included patients' higher self-rating of the severity of vomiting as an adverse drug reaction and alcohol abuse. Protective factors included receiving any type of assistance from the TB program, better. TB knowledge, and higher levels of trust in and support from physicians and nurses. These results provide insights for designing interventions aimed at reducing patient loss to follow-up during treatment for MDR TB.

10.1371_journal.pcbi.1004749	The Role of Adherence and Retreatment in De Novo Emergence of MDR-TB	Treatment failure after therapy of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) infections is an important challenge, especially when it coincides with de novo emergence of multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). We seek to explore possible causes why MDR-TB has been found to occur much more often in patients with a history of previous treatment. We develop a mathematical model of the replication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis within a patient reflecting the compartments of macrophages, granulomas, and open cavities as well as parameterizing the effects of drugs on the pathogen dynamics in these compartments. We use this model to study the influence of patient adherence to therapy and of common retreatment regimens on treatment outcome. As expected, the simulations show that treatment success increases with increasing adherence. However, treatment occasionally fails even under perfect adherence due to interpatient variability in pharmacological parameters. The risk of generating MDR de novo is highest between 40% and 80% adherence. Importantly, our simulations highlight the double-edged effect of retreatment: On the one hand, the recommended retreatment regimen increases the overall success rate compared to re-treating with the initial regimen. On the other hand, it increases the probability to accumulate more resistant genotypes. We conclude that treatment adherence is a key factor for a positive outcome, and that screening for resistant strains is advisable after treatment failure or relapse.

10.3892_etm.2015.2966	Efficacy and effect of free treatment on multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a serious public health and social issue. It pertains to the type of tuberculosis that is resistant simultaneously to isoniazid and rifampicin. MDR-TB has a high mortality and is expensive to treat. The aim of the present study was to examine the therapeutic effects of individualized free treatment and the relevant influencing factors on the treatment outcome for MDR-TB. A prospective study module was used to analyze the therapeutic outcome of MDR-TB with individualized free treatment for 160 patients between 2011 and 2014. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, and the odds ratio was calculated using a logistic regression analysis model. In total, 160 patients were enrolled in the study for treatment of MDR-TB. From these, 88 cases completed the course of treatment, and 70 cases were successfully treated. Of the remaining 72 cases, 37 cases exhibited treatment failure, 18 cases were suspended during treatment and 17 patients succumbed to the disease. The results showed that the confounding factors were: i) retreatment (p<0.05); ii) occurrence of diabetes (p<0.001); iii) lesion without improvement in radiography during treatment (p=0.001); iv) positive sputum culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis after 3-month treatment (p<0.05); and v) termination of treatment due to adverse reaction (p<0.05). These factors were associated with poor treatment outcomes by logistic regression analysis. Adverse drug reaction was observed in 33 cases and treatment was terminated or changed permanently in 29 of these cases. The most common adverse reaction was liver function damage caused by pyrazinamide and leucopenia caused by rifabutin. One patient suffered from serious liver failure. In conclusion, the success rate of long treatment course for MDR-TB is not high due to many adverse reactions. Occurrence of diabetes is the main factor that caused poor efficacy.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; individualized treatment; efficacy; adverse reactions	TREATMENT OUTCOMES; SOUTH-AFRICA; METAANALYSIS; PREDICTORS; TB; DRUGS
10.1371_journal.pone.0150054	Factors Associated with Tuberculosis and Rifampicin-Resistant Tuberculosis amongst Symptomatic Patients in India: A Retrospective Analysis	Background Tuberculosis remains a major public health challenge for India. Various studies have documented different levels of TB and multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB among diverse groups of the population. In view of renewed targets set under the End TB strategy by 2035, there is an urgent need for TB diagnosis to be strengthened. Drawing on data from a recent, multi-site study, we address key questions for TB diagnosis amongst symptomatics presenting for care: are there subgroups of patients that are more likely than others, to be positive for TB? In turn, amongst these positive cases, are there factors-apart from treatment history -that may be predictive for multi-drug resistance? Methods We used data from a multi-centric prospective demonstration study, conducted from March 2012 to December 2013 in 18 sub-district level TB programme units (TUs) in India and covering a population of 8.8 million. In place of standard diagnostic tests, upfront Xpert MTB/RIF testing was offered to all presumptive TB symptomatics. Here, using data from this study, we used logistic regression to identify association between risk factors and TB and Rifampicin-Resistant TB among symptomatics enrolled in the study. Results We find that male gender; history of TB treatment; and adult age compared with either children or the elderly are risk factors associated with high TB detection amongst symptomatics, across the TUs. While treatment history is found be a significant risk factor for rifampicin-resistant TB, elderly (65+ yrs) people have significantly lower risk than other age groups. However, pediatric TB cases have no less risk of rifampicin resistance as compared with adults (OR 1.23 (95% C. I. 0.85-1.76)). Similarly, risk of rifampicin resistance among both the genders was the same. These patterns applied across the study sites involved. Notably in Mumbai, amongst those patients with microbiological confirmation of TB, female patients showed a higher risk of having MDR-TB than male patients. Conclusion Our results cast fresh light on the characteristics of symptomatics presenting for care who are most likely to be microbiologically positive for TB, and for rifampicin resistance. The challenges posed by TB control are complex and multifactorial: evidence from diverse sources, including retrospective studies such as that addressed here, can be invaluable in informing future strategies to accelerate declines in TB burden.

10.1371_journal.pone.0149326	Ion Channel Blockers as Antimicrobial Agents, Efflux Inhibitors, and Enhancers of Macrophage Killing Activity against Drug Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Given the ability of M. tuberculosis to survive as an intracellular pathogen and its propensity to develop resistance to the existing antituberculosis drugs, its treatment requires new approaches. Here the antimycobacterial properties of verapamil, thioridazine, chlorpromazine, flupenthixol and haloperidol were investigated against a panel of drug resistant M. tuberculosis strains, both in vitro and on human-infected macrophages. These compounds are efflux inhibitors that share among them the characteristic of being ion channel blockers. In vitro, all compounds exhibited synergistic inhibitory activities when combined with isoniazid and rifampicin, and were able to inhibit active efflux, demonstrating their role as efflux inhibitors. Gene expression analysis showed that M. tuberculosis efflux genes were overexpressed in response to antibiotic exposure, in vitro and within macrophages, irrespective of their resistance pattern. These compounds displayed a rapid and high killing activity against M. tuberculosis, associated with a decrease in intracellular ATP levels demonstrating that the bactericidal action of the ion channel blockers against M. tuberculosis clinical strains is associated with their interference with energy metabolism. The compounds led to a decrease in the intracellular mycobacterial load by increasing phagosome acidification and activating lysosomal hydrolases. The results presented in this study enable us to propose the following mechanism of action for these compounds: a) in the bacteria, the compounds generate a cascade of events involving the inhibition of the respiratory chain complexes and energy production for efflux activity. Indirectly, this reduce the resistance level to antituberculosis drugs potentiating their activity; b) on the host cell, the treatment with the ion channel blockers increases phagosome acidification and induces the expression of phagosomal hydrolases, leading to bacterial growth restriction irrespective of their resistance pattern. This work highlights the potential value ion channel blockers as adjuvants of tuberculosis chemotherapy, in particular for the development of new therapeutic strategies, with strong potential for treatment shortening against drug susceptible and resistant forms of tuberculosis. Medicinal chemistry studies are now needed to improve the properties of these compounds, increasing their M. tuberculosis efflux-inhibition and killing-enhancement activity and reduce their toxicity for humans, therefore optimizing their potential for clinical usage.

10.1371_journal.pone.0149167	Treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-Infected Macrophages with Poly(Lactic-Co-Glycolic Acid) Microparticles Drives NF kappa B and Autophagy Dependent Bacillary Killing	"The emergence of multiple-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has pushed our available repertoire of anti-TB therapies to the limit of effectiveness. This has increased the urgency to develop novel treatment modalities, and inhalable microparticle (MP) formulations are a promising option to target the site of infection. We have engineered poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) MPs which can carry a payload of anti-TB agents, and are successfully taken up by human alveolar macrophages. Even without a drug cargo, MPs can be potent immunogens; yet little is known about how they influence macrophage function in the setting of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. To address this issue we infected THP-1 macrophages with Mtb H37Ra or H37Rv and treated with MPs. In controlled experiments we saw a reproducible reduction in bacillary viability when THP-1 macrophages were treated with drug-free MPs. NF kappa B activity was increased in MP-treated macrophages, although cytokine secretion was unaltered. Confocal microscopy of immortalized murine bone marrow-derived macrophages expressing GFP-tagged LC3 demonstrated induction of autophagy. Inhibition of caspases did not influence the MP-induced restriction of bacillary growth, however, blockade of NF kappa B or autophagy with pharmacological inhibitors reversed this MP effect on macrophage function. These data support harnessing inhaled PLGA MP-drug delivery systems as an immunotherapeutic in addition to serving as a vehicle for targeted drug delivery. Such ""added value"" could be exploited in the generation of inhaled vaccines as well as inhaled MDR-TB therapeutics when used as an adjunct to existing treatments."

10.1371_journal.pone.0149258	Genotypic, Phenotypic and Clinical Validation of GeneXpert in Extra-Pulmonary and Pulmonary Tuberculosis in India	Background Newer molecular diagnostics have brought paradigm shift in early diagnosis of tuberculosis [TB]. WHO recommended use of GeneXpert MTB/RIF [Xpert] for Extra-pulmonary [EP] TB; critics have since questioned its efficiency. Methods The present study was designed to assess the performance of GeneXpert in 761 extra-pulmonary and 384 pulmonary specimens from patients clinically suspected of TB and compare with Phenotypic, Genotypic and Composite reference standards [CRS]. Results Comparison of GeneXpert results to CRS, demonstrated sensitivity of 100% and 90.68%, specificity of 100% and 99.62% for pulmonary and extra-pulmonary samples. On comparison with culture, sensitivity for Rifampicin [Rif] resistance detection was 87.5% and 81.82% respectively, while specificity was 100% for both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB. On comparison to sequencing of rpoB gene [Rif resistance determining region, RRDR], sensitivity was respectively 93.33% and 90% while specificity was 100% in both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB. GeneXpert assay missed 533CCG mutation in one sputum and dual mutation [517 & 519] in one pus sample, detected by sequencing. Sequencing picked dual mutation [529, 530] in a sputum sample sensitive to Rif, demonstrating, not all RRDR mutations lead to resistance. Conclusions Current study reports observations in a patient care setting in a high burden region, from a large collection of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary samples and puts to rest questions regarding sensitivity, specificity, detection of infrequent mutations and mutations responsible for low-level Rif resistance by GeneXpert. Improvements in the assay could offer further improvement in sensitivity of detection in different patient samples; nevertheless it may be difficult to improve sensitivity of Rif resistance detection if only one gene is targeted. Assay specificity was high both for TB detection and Rif resistance detection. Despite a few misses, the assay offers major boost to early diagnosis of TB and MDR-TB, in difficult to diagnose pauci-bacillary TB.

10.1186_s12995_016_0093_x	Consequences of tuberculosis among asylum seekers for health care workers in Germany	Background: Immigrants have been contributing to the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in Germany for many years. The current wave of migration of asylum seekers to Germany may increase that figure. Healthcare workers (HCW) who look after refugees not only in hospitals and medical practices but also in aid projects may be exposed to cases of TB. Methods: The incremental TB cases arising from imported TB as well as from TB cases that developed later in refugees were calculated in a Markov model over a period of 5 years. Infectious and non-infectious susceptible TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases were determined separately. In addition, the total amount of latent TB in contact persons and the risk of infection by HCW were estimated. Due to uncertainty of future refugee flows to Europe, different scenarios were considered in univariate and multivariate sensitivity analysis. Results: Assuming a decrease in immigration by half each year to the bottom line of 2014, and in light of the current number of 800,000 asylum seekers, we calculated an additional 10,090 TB cases by the end of the fifth year (5976 cases of infectious pulmonary TB and 143 cases of pulmonary MDR-TB). In case of an unchanging influx of asylum seekers over the 5-year period, 19,031 TB cases would arise, 377 of which infectious MDR-TB. Eighty-seven ensuing TB cases would develop in HCW in the same period, 3 of which MDR-TB cases. Conclusions: Although the total number of TB cases in HCW expected to ensue from the current influx of asylum seekers is rather small, the 3 MDR-TB cases we calculated have to be taken seriously. We consider it essential to increase awareness of protective measures such as respiratory masks and, in the event of documented exposure, of supply-oriented occupational health screening.

10.1016_j.ejps.2015.12.013	UDP-GlcNAc pathway: Potential target for inhibitor discovery against M-tuberculosis	In the past five years, an alarming increase in the number of patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) has been reported, particularly in Eastern Europe, Asia and Southern Africa. Current situation has challenged the control and treatment of tuberculosis (TB) which sparked an emergent need to find new anti-tubercular agents with different chemical scaffolds andmechanisms of action. A very fruitful way to identify novel anti-tubercular agents is the development of compounds that target the enzymes essentially required for the biosynthesis and assembly of the mycobacterial cell wall. Biosynthesis of uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) represents one such pathway. Enzymes involved in UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis have been predicted to be essential for Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth in vitro. It is a key precursor molecule of M. tuberculosis cell wall, being situated at the branched point of two essential biosynthetic pathways, namely peptidoglycan and a disaccharide linker, D-N-GlcNAc-1-rhamnose. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the present knowledge on the enzymes catalyzing the particular steps of the pathway in M. tuberculosis, with special emphasis put on N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GlmU), a bifunctional enzyme, which catalyzes the last two steps of this pathway. It also gives an insight into the present knowledge about the inhibitors reported against the enzymes, which could be further used as chemical scaffold for the discovery of more potent anti-TB compounds.

10.1038_srep17850	The diagnostic accuracy of the MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl assays for drug-resistant TB detection when performed on sputum and culture isolates	Although molecular tests for drug-resistant TB perform well on culture isolates, their accuracy using clinical samples, particularly from TB and HIV-endemic settings, requires clarification. The MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl line probe assays were evaluated in 181 sputum samples and 270 isolates from patients with culture-confirmed drug-sensitive-TB, MDR-TB, or XDR-TB. Phenotypic culture-based testing was the reference standard. Using sputum, the sensitivities for resistance was 97.7%, 95.4%, 58.9%, 61.6% for rifampicin, isoniazid, ofloxacin, and amikacin, respectively, whereas the specificities were 91.8%, 89%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. MTBDRsl sensitivity differed in smear-positive vs. smear-negative samples (79.2% vs. 20%, p < 0.0001 for ofloxacin; 72.9% vs. 37%, p = 0.0023 for amikacin) but not by HIV status. If used sequentially, MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl could rule-in XDR-TB in 78.5% (22/28) and 10.5% (2/19) of smear-positive and smear-negative samples, respectively. On culture isolates, the sensitivity for resistance to rifampicin, isoniazid, ofloxacin, and amikacin was 95.1%, 96.1%, 72.3% and 76.6%, respectively, whereas the specificities exceeded 96%. Using a sequential testing approach, rapid sputum-based diagnosis of fluoroquinolone or aminoglycoside-resistant TB is feasible only in smear-positive samples, where rule-in value is good. Further investigation is required in samples that test susceptible in order to rule-out second-line drug resistance.

10.1016_j.molstruc.2015.10.047	Multinuclear NMR analysis of the antitubercular drug ethionamide	Tuberculosis remains as the deadliest bacterial infection in developing countries, a situation that is particularly aggravated by the increasing spread of multidrug resistant mycobacteria (MDR-TB). In this view, not only new anti-tubercular drugs are urgently needed, but also a better understanding of the existing ones may aid in the future design of more efficient derivatives or surrogates. Ethionamide (ETA) is an anti-tubercular pro-drug used as second-line therapy against MDR-TB, being bio-activated by the mycobacterial monooxygenase EtA. ETA has been the focus of several research works, devoted either to the identification of ETA's metabolites or to the development of novel derivatives potentially useful to fight against tuberculosis. In either case, structural analysis of ETA and related structures is of undeniable relevance, while the presence of sulfur in ETA's structure brings about the possibility of including 33SNMR in the toolbox of structural analysis techniques. In this work, we have engaged into a multinuclear NMR characterization of ETA, through the study of the drug's solubility in seven deuterated solvents, and of the chemical shifts for different nuclei in ETA. Results showed which are the best conditions to study ETA by NMR and provided some important evidence on the low reactivity of the drug's thioamide group, which may be of relevance for future drug derivatization approaches.

10.1186_s12890_016_0187_3	Later emergence of acquired drug resistance and its effect on treatment outcome in patients treated with Standard Short-Course Chemotherapy for tuberculosis	Backgrounds: The failure of current Standard Short-Course Chemotherapy (SCC) in new and previously treated cases with tuberculosis (TB) was mainly due to drug resistance development. But little is known on the characteristics of acquired drug resistant TB during SCC and its correlation with SCC failure. The objective of the study is to explore the traits of acquired drug resistant TB emergence and evaluate their impacts on treatment outcomes. Methods: A prospective observational study was performed on newly admitted smear positive pulmonary TB (PTB) cases without drug resistance pretreatment treated with SCC under China's National TB Control Program (NTP) condition from 2008 to 2010. Enrolled cases were followed up through sputum smear, culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) at the end of 1, 2, and 5 months after treatment initiation. The effect factors of early or late emergence of acquired drug resistant TB, such as acquired drug resistance patterns, the number of acquired resistant drugs and previous treatment history were investigated by multivariate logistic regression; and the impact of acquired drug resistant TB emergence on treatment failure were further evaluated. Results: Among 1671 enrolled new and previously treated cases with SCC, 62 (3.7 %) acquired different patterns of drug resistant TB at early period within 2 months or later around 3-5 months of treatment. Previously treated cases were more likely to develop acquired multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) (OR, 3.8; 95 % CI, 1.4-10.4; P = 0.015). Additionally, acquired MDR-TB cases were more likely to emerge at later period around 3-5 months after treatment starting than that of non-MDR-TB mainly appeared within 2 months (OR, 8.3; 95 % CI, 1.7-39.9; P = 0.008). Treatment failure was associated with late acquired drug resistant TB emergence (OR, 25.7; 95 % CI, 4.3-153.4; P < 0.001) with the reference of early acquired drug resistant TB emergence. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that later development of acquired drug resistant TB during SCC is liable to suffer treatment failure and acquired MDR-TB pattern may be one of the possible causes.

10.1183_13993003.00724_2015	Bedaquiline in the treatment of multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis	Bedaquiline, a diarylquinoline, improved cure rates when added to a multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment regimen in a previous placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial (TMC207-C208; NCT00449644). The current phase 2, multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial (TMC207-C209; NCT00910871) reported here was conducted to confirm the safety and efficacy of bedaquiline. Newly diagnosed or previously treated patients with MDR-TB (including pre-extensively drug-resistant (pre-XDR)-TB or extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB) received bedaquiline for 24 weeks with a background regimen of anti-TB drugs continued according to National TB Programme treatment guidelines. Patients were assessed during and up to 120 weeks after starting bedaquiline. Of 233 enrolled patients, 63.5% had MDR-TB, 18.9% had pre-XDR-TB and 16.3% had XDR-TB, with 87.1% having taken second-line drugs prior to enrolment. 16 patients (6.9%) died. 20 patients (8.6%) discontinued before week 24, most commonly due to adverse events or MDR-TB-related events. Adverse events were generally those commonly associated with MDR-TB treatment. In the efficacy population (n=205), culture conversion (missing outcome classified as failure) was 72.2% at 120 weeks, and 73.1%, 70.5% and 62.2% in MDR-TB, pre-XDR-TB and XDR-TB patients, respectively. Addition of bedaquiline to a background regimen was well tolerated and led to good outcomes in this clinically relevant patient cohort with MDR-TB.

10.1183_13993003.01333_2015	Cost-benefit analysis of Xpert MTB/RIF for tuberculosis suspects in German hospitals	Our objective was to assess the cost-benefit of enhancing or replacing the conventional sputum smear with the real-time PCR Xpert MTB/RIF method in the inpatient diagnostic schema for tuberculosis (TB). Recent data from published per-case cost studies for TB/multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB and from comparative analyses of sputum microscopy, mycobacterial culture, Xpert MTB/RIF and drug susceptibility testing, performed at the German National Reference Center for Mycobacteria, were used. Potential cost savings of Xpert MTB/RIF, based on test accuracy and multiple cost drivers, were calculated for diagnosing TB/MDR-TB suspects from the hospital perspective. Implementing Xpert MTB/RIF as an add-on in smear-positive and smear-negative TB suspects saves on average (sic)48.72 and (sic)503, respectively, per admitted patient as compared with the conventional approach. In smear-positive and smear-negative MDR-TB suspects, cost savings amount to (sic)189.56 and (sic)515.25 per person, respectively. Full replacement of microscopy by Xpert MTB/RIF saves (sic)449.98. In probabilistic Monte-Carlo simulation, adding Xpert MTB/RIF is less costly in 46.4% and 76.2% of smear-positive TB and MDR-TB suspects, respectively, but 100% less expensive in all smear-negative suspects. Full replacement by Xpert MTB/RIF is also consistently cost-saving. Using Xpert MTB/RIF as an add-on to and even as a replacement for sputum smear examination may significantly reduce expenditures in TB suspects.		RECOMMENDATIONS
10.3967_bes2016.010	Prevalence and Risk Factors of Primary Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in China	Objective To investigate the prevalence of primary drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and associated risk factors in China. We also explored factors contributing to the transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Methods A total of 2794 representative, Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from treatment-naive patients were subjected to drug susceptibility testing, and risk factors for drug-resistant TB were analyzed. We also analyzed MDR-TB strain sublineages, drug-resistance-conferring mutations, and risk factors associated with clustered primary MDR strains. Results Among 2794 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from treatment-naive patients, the prevalence of any resistance to first-line drugs was 33.2% and the prevalence of MDR-TB was 5.7%. We did not find any risk factors significantly associated with resistance to first-line drugs. The 93 primary MDR-TB isolates were classified into six sublineages, of which, 75 (80.6%) isolates were the RD105-deleted Beijing lineage. The largest sublineage included 65 (69.9%) isolates with concurrent deletions of RD105, RD207, and RD181. Twenty-nine (31.2%) primary MDR strains grouped in clusters; MDR isolates in clusters were more likely to have S531L rpoB mutation. Conclusion This study indicates that primary drug-resistant TB and MDR-TB strains are prevalent in China, and multiple measures should be taken to address drug-resistant TB.

10.1093_jac_dkv345	Evidence for the critical role of a secondary site rpoB mutation in the compensatory evolution and successful transmission of an MDR tuberculosis outbreak strain	MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical strains that cause large outbreaks, particularly among HIV-negative patients, are likely to have undergone the most successful compensatory evolution. Hence, mutations secondary to the acquisition of drug resistance are worthy of consideration in these highly transmissible strains. Here, we assessed the role of a mutation within rpoB, rpoB V615M, secondary to the rifampicin resistance-conferring mutation rpoB S531L, which is associated with a major MDR tuberculosis outbreak strain that evolved in an HIV-negative context in northern Tunisia. Using BCG as a model organism, we engineered strains harbouring either the rpoB S531L mutation alone or the double mutation rpoB S531L, V615M. Individual and competitive in vitro growth assays were performed in order to assess the relative fitness of each BCG mutant. The rpoB V615M mutation was found to be invariably associated with rpoB S531L. Structural analysis mapped rpoB V615M to the same bridge helix region as rpoB compensatory mutations previously described in Salmonella. Compared with the rpoB single-mutant BCG, the double mutant displayed improved growth characteristics and fitness rates equivalent to WT BCG. Strikingly, the rpoB double mutation conferred high-level resistance to rifampicin. Here, we demonstrated the fitness compensatory role of a mutation within rpoB, secondary to the rifampicin resistance mutation rpoB S531L, which is characteristic of an MDR M. tuberculosis major outbreak strain. The finding that this secondary mutation concomitantly increased the resistance level to rifampicin argues for its significant contribution to the successful transmission of the MDR-TB strain.

10.1093_jac_dkv353	Susceptibility testing breakpoints for Mycobacterium tuberculosis categorize isolates with resistance mutations in gyrA as susceptible to fluoroquinolones: implications for MDR-TB treatment and the definition of XDR-TB	Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are important in the treatment of MDR-TB and in the definition of XDR-TB. Our objective was to investigate how discrepancies in the phenotypic and genotypic methods for antimicrobial susceptibility testing could affect the interpretation of antimicrobial susceptibility test results. We analysed MICs of ofloxacin and levofloxacin in Middlebrook 7H10 broth (7H10) as well as sequencing of the quinolone resistance-determining region of the gyrA gene and the MTBDRsl assay in 75 resistant isolates, including MDR and XDR strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Among 75 resistant isolates, 27 had mutations associated with FQ resistance. Among isolates with resistance mutations in gyrA, 26% (seven of 27) were susceptible to levofloxacin and ofloxacin by phenotypic testing at 1 mg/L and 2 mg/L. The most common mutation was in codon 94 and these isolates had significantly increased MICs of levofloxacin (2-8 mg/L) compared with isolates with mutations in codon 90 (0.25-2 mg/L, PaEuroS < aEuroS0.05). The sensitivity and specificity for the MTBDRsl assay compared with gyrA sequencing were 96% and 98%, respectively. Current critical concentrations may classify up to 26% of isolates with gyrA mutations as susceptible to FQs due to a close relationship between susceptible and resistant populations. These results should be considered while improving clinical breakpoints for M. tuberculosis and may have an impact on the definition of XDR-TB.

10.1016_j.eimc.2015.04.003	Retrospective study of tolerability and efficacy of linezolid in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (1998-2014)	Introduction: Although linezolid is known to be effective when used as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), the clinical experience is limited. In this study the efficacy and adverse effects of linezolid treatment were evaluated. Methods: A retrospective study of tolerability and efficacy of linezolid in MDR-TB patients was performed in Madrid, Spain. Demographic characteristics, microbiological and clinical features and data on treatment tolerability were collected. Regimens were constructed with a target of prescribing, at least, five anti-tuberculosis agents likely to be effective. Linezolid, at a dosage of 1200 or 600 mg daily, was included to complete the treatment if no other sensitive drugs were available. Vitamin B6 was used to reduce toxicity. Treatment outcome and clinical status at last contact were compared between patients with linezolid-containing regimens and with those without linezolid-containing regimens. Results: During the period 1998-2014, 55 patients with MDR-TB received treatment. In 21 of these patients, linezolid was added. The median of linezolid administration was 23.9 months (IQT 13.1-24.7). Patients using linezolid showed a greater resistance to drugs, with a median of 6 (IQR 5-7) compared with those who did not use it, with a median of 4 drugs (IQR 3-5) (p < 0.001). The median time to sputum culture conversion of the patients in the linezolid group (73.5 days) did not differ significantly from those in the non-linezolid group (61 days) (p = 0.29). There were no significant differences in the outcomes of the two patient groups. There were no reported adverse events in 81% of patients assigned to linezolid therapy. Only four patients developed toxicity attributed to linezolid. The most serious adverse event in these patients was anemia observed in the two patients treated with 1200 mg per day. One of them also developed moderate paresthesia. In both cases the dosage was reduced to 600 mg per day, with improvement of the anemia and paresthesias. No patients stopped linezolid therapy. Conclusion: A daily dosage of 600 mg of linezolid was well tolerated without stopping treatment in any case. The efficacy of the treatment and the outcomes were similar in both the linezolid and non-linezolid group.

10.1016_j.clnu.2015.02.007	Macronutrient intake and body composition changes during anti-tuberculosis therapy in adults	Background: Malnutrition is common in patients with active tuberculosis (TB), yet little information is available on serial dietary intake or body composition in TB disease. Objective: To evaluate macronutrient intake and body composition in individuals with newly diagnosed TB over time. Design: Adults with active pulmonary TB (n = 191; 23 with multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and 36 culture-negative household contacts (controls) enrolled in a clinical trial of high-dose cholecalciferol (vitamin D-3) were studied. Macronutrient intake was determined at baseline, 8 and 16 weeks. Serial body composition was assessed by body mass index (BMI; kg/m(2)) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to estimate fat mass and fat-free mass. Descriptive statistics, repeated measures ANOVA for changes over time and linear regression were used. Results: At baseline, mean daily energy, protein, fat and carbohydrate (CHO) intakes were significantly higher, and body weight, BMI, fat-free mass and fat mass were significantly lower, between TB subjects and controls. These remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, employment status and smoking. In all TB subjects, baseline mean daily intakes of energy, fat and protein were adequate when compared to the US Dietary Reference Intakes and protein significantly increased over time (p < 0.0001). Body weight, BMI, and fat and fat-free mass increased over time. MDR-TB patients exhibited lower body weight and fat-free mass over time, despite similar daily intake of kcal, protein, and fat. Conclusions: Macronutrient intake was higher in TB patients than controls, but TB-induced wasting was evident. As macronutrient intake of TB subjects increased over time, there was a parallel increase in BMI, while body composition proportions were maintained. However, individuals with MDR-TB demonstrated concomitantly decreased body weight and fat-free mass over time versus drug-sensitive TB patients, despite increased macronutrient intake. Thus, MDR-TB appears to blunt anabolism to macronutrient intake, likely reflecting the catabolic effects of TB. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

10.1016_j.arbres.2015.03.010	Outbreak of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in two secondary schools	Objectives: To describe an outbreak of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in two schools Methods: This was a prospective, observational study of an outbreak of MDR-TB in 2 schools located in the towns of Onda and Nules, in the Spanish province of Castellon, from the moment of detection in November 2008 until November 2014, including patient follow-up and contact tracing. Results: Five cases of MDR-TB were diagnosed. Overall attack rate was 0.9%, and among the contacts traced, 66 had latent tuberculous infection, with an infection rate of 14.4%. Molecular characterization of the 5 M. tuberculosis isolates was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the IS6110 sequence. In all 5 patients, cultures were negative at 4-month follow-up, showing the efficacy of the treatment given. No recurrence has been reported to date. Conclusions: In the context of globalization and the increased prevalence of MDR-TB, outbreaks such as the one presented here are only to be expected. Contact tracing, strict follow-up of confirmed cases, the availability of fast diagnostic techniques to avoid treatment delay, and chemoprophylaxis, together with the molecular characterization of strains, are still essential (C) 2015 SEPAR.

10.1111_tmi.12648	Cost-optimization in the treatment of multidrug resistant tuberculosis in Nigeria	ObjectiveTo compare the cost of facility-based MDR TB care (F) to home-based care (H) from the perspective of the Nigerian national health system. MethodsWe assessed the expected costs of the two MDR TB treatment approaches using a decision-analytic model with a follow-up of 6 months. MDR TB treatment outcomes were obtained from a systematic review of randomised clinical trials. The outcomes of interest included treatment success, treatment failure, treatment default and mortality and did not vary significantly between the two alternatives. Treatment costs included the cost of the following: drug therapy (F, H), hospital stay (F), nurse care (F, H), physician care (F), nursing facility (F) and transport to the healthcare provider (H). Finally, we estimated the potential cost savings associated with home-based treatment for all patients starting MDR TB treatment in Nigeria. ResultsThe average expected total treatment cost for a Nigerian patient treated for MDR TB was estimated at US2095 for facility - based care and 1535 for home-based care, a potential saving of 25%. One of the major drivers of this difference is significantly more intensive, and therefore more costly, nursing care in hospitals. In 2013, a total of 426 patients were initiated on facility-based MDR TB treatment in Nigeria. Thus, the potential savings through home-based care are US$ 223 204 per year. ConclusionIn Nigeria, treatment of MDR TB using home-based care is expected to result in similar patient outcomes at markedly reduced public health costs as facility-based care.

10.1177_0284185115575196	CT and microbiologic follow-up in primary multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis	Background: Little attention has been paid to the initial and follow-up computed tomography (CT) features in primary multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (pMDR-TB) setting. Purpose: To describe serial CT findings and clinical course of pMDR-TB with antibiotic treatment. Material and Methods: For the last 10 years, 340 MDR-TB patients were managed in a tertiary referral hospital. Among them, we included 44 (27 men, 17 women; mean age, 40 years; age range, 20-81 years) pMDR-TB patients; 37 treated with chemotherapy only and seven treated with medical therapy plus surgery. CT findings were evaluated regarding tree-in-bud sign, acinar nodule, peribronchial, segmental or lobar consolidation and cavity, and their extent. Sputum negative conversion rates and serial CT scores were assessed. To compare changes in disease extent between initial and follow-up CT studies, paired t-test was performed. Results: Two most frequent patterns of lung abnormality were tree-in-bud sign (37 of 44, 84.1%) and acinar nodule (41 of 44, 93.2%). Among 37 patients treated with chemotherapy only, 36 showed negative sputum conversion within 3 months after second-line drug commencement, maintained for > 12 months. The other seven undergoing surgery during medical treatment showed excellent outcome with negative conversion achieved within one month after surgery and maintained for > 12 months. CT scores showed significant decrease on serial CT studies (P<0.001) in all. Conclusion: In pMDR-TB, two most frequent abnormal CT patterns are tree-in-bud sign and acinar nodule. In 98% of patients, negative sputum conversion is achieved, and CT score also shows decrease in extent after TB chemotherapy.

10.5588_ijtld.14.0986	Detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis using MGIT (TM) and MAS-PCR in Tripura, India	BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) poses a global threat that is further compounded by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic. OBJECTIVE: To detect MDR-TB among pulmonary TB (PTB) patients with or without HIV coinfection by isolating and identifying Mycobacterium tuberculosis from clinical samples and performing drug susceptibility testing (DST). METHODS: Sputum was collected from presumed PTB cases. Microscopic examination was performed following Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining and cultured in Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium. First-line anti-tuberculosis DST of the isolates was performed using MGIT (TM) (Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube) and multiplex allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (MAS-PCR). RESULTS: Of 172 study subjects, 59.3% (102/172) were smear-positive and 40.7% (70/172) were smear negative. In the smear-positive and -negative groups, respectively 62.7% (64/102) and 8.6% (6/70) were culture-positive. DST on MGIT showed a cumulative resistance of 7.1% (5/70) to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin. More ethambutol (EMB) and combined INH+EMB resistance was detected using MAS-PCR. CONCLUSION: MDR-TB is a problem in Tripura, and culture and phenotypic DST are required for diagnosis. MAS-PCR may provide an alternative rapid screening tool.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0962	Identification of patients who could benefit from bedaquiline or delamanid: a multisite MDR-TB cohort study	BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization recommends adding bedaquiline or delamanid to multi drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) regimens for which four effective drugs are not available, and delamanid for patients at high risk of poor outcome. OBJECTIVE: To identify patients at risk of unfavourable outcomes who may benefit from the new drugs. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of treatment outcomes involving four to five effective drugs for 1524 months in programmes in Uzbekistan, Georgia, Armenia, Swaziland and Kenya between 2001 and 2011. RESULTS: Of 1433 patients, 48.5% had body mass index (BMI) <18.5 kg/m(2), 72.9% had a high bacillary load, 16.7% were resistant to two injectables, 2.9% were resistant to ofloxacin (OFX) and 3.0% had extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). Treatment success ranged from 59.7% (no second-line resistance) to 27.0% (XDR-TB). XDR-TB (aOR 8.16, 95%CI 3.22-20.64), resistance to two injectables (aOR 1.90, 95%CI 1.00-3.62) or OFX (aOR 5.56, 95%CI 2.15-14.37), past incarceration (aOR 1.88, 95%CI 1.11-3.2), history of second-line treatment (aOR 3.24, 95%CI 1.53-6.85), low BMI (aOR 2.22, 95%CI 1.56-3.12) and high bacillary load (aOR 2.32, 95%CI 1.15-4.67) were associated with unfavourable outcomes. Patients started on capreomycin rather than kanamycin were more likely to have an unfavourable outcome (aOR 1.54, 95%CI 1.04-2.28). CONCLUSION: In our cohort, patients who may benefit from bedaquiline and delamanid represented up to two thirds of all MDR-TB patients.	treatment; regimens; resource-limited; drug resistance; tuberculosis; outcomes	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; EXTENSIVE DRUG-RESISTANCE; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; METAANALYSIS
10.5588_ijtld.14.0961	Undertreated HIV and drug-resistant tuberculosis at a referral hospital in Irkutsk, Siberia	SETTING: A referral hospital for tuberculosis (TB) in Irkutsk, the Russian Federation. OBJECTIVE: To describe disease characteristics, treatment and hospital outcomes of TB-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). DESIGN: Observational cohort of HIV-infected patients admitted for anti-tuberculosis treatment over 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 98 patients were enrolled with a median CD4 count of 147 cells/mm(3) and viral load of 205 943 copies/ml. Among patients with drug susceptibility testing (DST) results, 29 (64%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR), including 12 without previous anti-tuberculosis treatment. Nineteen patients were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at admission, and 10 (13% ART-nave) were started during hospitalization. Barriers to timely ART initiation included death, inpatient treatment interruption, and patient refusal. Of 96 evaluable patients, 21 (22%) died, 14 (15%) interrupted treatment, and 10 (10%) showed no microbiological or radiographic improvement. Patients with a cavitary chest X-ray (aOR 7.4, 95%CI 2.3-23.7, P = 0.001) or central nervous system disease (aOR 6.5, 95%CI 1.2-36.1, P = 0.03) were more likely to have one of these poor outcomes. CONCLUSION: High rates of MDR-TB, treatment interruption and death were found in an HIV-infected population hospitalized in Irkutsk. There are opportunities for integration of HIV and TB services to overcome barriers to timely ART initiation, increase the use of anti-tuberculosis regimens informed by second-line DST, and strengthen out-patient diagnosis and treatment networks.	multidrug-resistant TB; Russian Federation; extensively drug-resistant TB; human immunodeficiency virus; injection drug use	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MDR-TB; USERS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; OUTCOMES; REGIONS; AFRICA; PLATE; CARE
10.1093_jac_dkv360	Specific gyrA gene mutations predict poor treatment outcome in MDR-TB	Mutations in the gyrase genes cause fluoroquinolone resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, the predictive value of these markers for clinical outcomes in patients with MDR-TB is unknown to date. The objective of this study was to determine molecular markers and breakpoints predicting second-line treatment outcomes in M. tuberculosis patients treated with fourth-generation fluoroquinolones. We analysed treatment outcome data in relation to the gyrA and gyrB sequences and MICs of ofloxacin, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin for pretreatment M. tuberculosis isolates from 181 MDR-TB patients in Bangladesh whose isolates were susceptible to injectable drugs. The gyrA 90Val, 94Gly and 94Ala mutations were most frequent, with the highest resistance levels for 94Gly mutants. Increased pretreatment resistance levels (> 2 mg/L), related to specific mutations, were associated with lower cure percentages, with no cure in patients whose isolates were resistant to gatifloxacin at 4 mg/L. Any gyrA 94 mutation, except 94Ala, predicted a significantly lower proportion of cure compared with all other gyrA mutations taken together (all non-94 mutantsaEuroS+aEuroS94Ala) [ORaEuroS=aEuroS4.3 (95% CI 1.4-13.0)]. The difference in treatment outcome was not explained by resistance to the other drugs. Our study suggests that gyrA mutations at position 94, other than Ala, predict high-level resistance to gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin, as well as poor treatment outcome, in MDR-TB patients in whom an injectable agent is still effective.

10.1186_s40249_016_0103_3	Drug-resistant tuberculosis control in China: progress and challenges	Background: China has the second highest caseload of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the world. In 2009, the Chinese government agreed to draw up a plan for MDR-TB prevention and control in the context of a comprehensive health system reform launched in the same year. Discussion: China is facing high prevalence rates of drug-resistant TB and MDR-TB. MDR-TB disproportionally affects the poor rural population and the highest rates are in less developed regions largely due to interrupted and/or inappropriate TB treatment. Most households with an affected member suffer a heavy financial burden because of a combination of treatment and other related costs. The influential Global Fund programme for MDR-TB control in China provides technical and financial support for MDR-TB diagnosis and treatment. However, this programme has a fixed timeline and cannot provide a long term solution. In 2009, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, in cooperation with the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China, started to develop innovative approaches to TB/MDR-TB management and case-based payment mechanisms for treatment, alongside increased health insurance benefits for patients, in order to contain medical costs and reduce financial barriers to treatment. Although these efforts appear to be in the right direction, they may not be sufficient unless (a) domestic sources are mobilized to raise funding for TB/MDR-TB prevention and control and (b) appropriate incentives are given to both health facilities and their care providers. Summary: Along with the on-going Chinese health system reform, sustained government financing and social health protection schemes will be critical to ensure universal access to appropriate TB treatment in order to reduce risk of developing MDR-TB and systematic MDR-TB treatment and management.

10.1371_journal.pone.0147529	Pattern of Drug Resistance and Risk Factors Associated with Development of Drug Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Pakistan	Background Drug resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is a major public health problem in developing countries such as Pakistan. Objective The current study was conducted to assess the frequency of drug resistant tuberculosis including multi drug resistance (MDR-TB) as well as risk factors for development of DR-TB, in Punjab, Pakistan. Methodology Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed, using proportion method, for 2367 culture positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) cases that were enrolled from January 2012 to December 2013 in the province of Punjab, Pakistan, against first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. The data was analyzed using statistical software; SPSS version 18. Results Out of 2367 isolates, 273 (11.5%) were resistant to at least one anti-TB drug, while 221 (9.3%) showed MDR-TB. Risk factors for development of MDR-TB were early age (ranges between 10-25 years) and previously treated TB patients. Conclusion DR-TB is a considerable problem in Pakistan. Major risk factors are previous history of TB treatment and younger age group. It emphasizes the need for effective TB control Program in the country.

10.1186_s12889_016_2711_z	Determinants of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Henan province in China: a case control study	Background: Multi-drug resistance (MDR) has been a cause of concern for tuberculosis (TB) control in both developed and developing countries. This study described the characteristics and risk factors associated with MDR-TB among 287 cases and 291 controls in Henan province, China. Methods: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted between June 2012 and December 2013. The study subjects were selected using multistage probability sampling. Multivariate conditional logistic regression models were used to determine the risk factors associated with MDR-TB. Results: The following risk factors for MDR-TB were identified: previous TB treatment (AOR = 4.51, 95 % CI: 3.55-5.56), male sex (AOR = 1.09, 95 % CI: 0.24-1.88), high school or lower education degree (AOR = 1.87, 95 % CI: 1.27-2.69), unemployment (AOR = 1.30, 95 % CI: 0.78-2.52), long distance of residence from the health facility (AOR = 6.66,95 % CI: 5.92-7.72), smoking (AOR = 2.07, 95 % CI: 1.66-3.19), poor knowledge regarding MDR-TB (AOR = 2.06, 95 % CI: 1.66-2.92), traveling by foot to reach the health facility (AOR = 1.85, 95 % CI: 1.12-3.09), estimated amount of time to reach the health facility was greater than 3 h (AOR = 1.42, 95 % CI: 0.51-2.35), social stigma (AOR = 1.17, 95 % CI: 0.27-2.03), having an opportunistic infection (AOR = 1.45, 95 % CI: 0.58-2.4), more than 3 TB foci in the lungs (AOR = 1.98, 95 % CI: 1.49-3.25), total time of first treatment was more than 8 months (AOR = 1.39, 95 % CI: 0.65-2.54), adverse effects of anti-TB medication (AOR = 2.39, 95 % CI: 1.40-3.26), and more than 3 prior episodes of anti-TB treatment (AOR = 1.83, 95 % CI: 1.26-2.80). Conclusion: The identified risk factors should be given priority in TB control programs. Additionally, there is a compelling need for better management and control of MDR-TB, particularly through increasing laboratory capacity, regular screening, enhancing drug sensitivity testing, novel MDR-TB drug regimens, and adherence to medication.

10.1016_j.jchromb.2015.11.058	Development and validation of LC-ESI-MS/MS method for analysis of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin in serum of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients: Potential application as therapeutic drug monitoring tool in medical diagnosis	Moxifloxacin (MFX) and levofloxacin (LFX), class of fluoroquinolone antibiotics, are the two most prescribed drugs to multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients. A single, sensitive and reliable LC-ESI-MS/MS method was developed and validated to simultaneously quantitate the levels of these drugs in human serum where enrofloxacin (EFX) was used as internal standard (IS). Quantification was achieved by multiple reaction monitoring of selected mass transitions from precursor ions to product ions m/z 402.2 -> 384.2 for MFX, 362.2 -> 318.2 for LFX, and 362.1 -> 318.3 for EFX. Calibration curves were plotted using concentrations ranging between 0.23-1000 ng/mL for MFX and 0.13-1000 ng/mL for LFX, and the correlation coefficients (r(2)) were in excess of 0.999. Intra- and inert-day accuracy was ranged between 92.1-104% with mean recoveries of 96% and 95.5% for MFX and LFX, respectively and precision was <9% at all quality control concentration levels. Matrix effect analysis showed extraction efficiency of 93.0-94.6% for MFX and 90.9-99.5% for LFX. Application of the developed method to real sample analysis resulted in efficient quantification of MFX and LFX in serum samples obtained from ten MDR-TB patients. The result indicated that the method could be applied as a potential drug monitoring tool to accurately analyze MFX and LFX within a short run time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

10.1371_journal.pone.0146106	A Novel Molecular Strategy for Surveillance of Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis in High Burden Settings	Background In South Africa and other high prevalence countries, transmission is a significant contributor to rising rates of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Thus, there is a need to develop an early detection system for transmission clusters suitable for high burden settings. We have evaluated the discriminatory power and clustering concordance of a novel and simple genotyping approach, combining spoligotyping with pncA sequencing (SpoNC), against two well-established methods: IS6110-RFLP and 24-loci MIRU-VNTR. Methods A total of 216 MDR-TB isolates collected from January to June 2010 from the NHLS Central TB referral laboratory in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, representing a diversity of strains from South Africa, were included. The isolates were submitted for genotyping, pncA sequencing and analysis to the Centre for Tuberculosis in South Africa and the Public Health Research Institute Tuberculosis Center at Rutgers University in the United States. Clustering rates, Hunter-Gaston Discriminatory Indexes (HGI) and Wallace coefficients were compared between the methods. Results Overall clustering rates were high by both IS6110-RFLP (52.8%) and MIRU-VNTR (45.8%), indicative of on-going transmission. Both 24-loci MIRU-VNTR and IS6110-RFLP had similar HGI (0.972 and 0.973, respectively), with close numbers of unique profiles (87 vs. 70), clustered isolates (129 vs. 146), and cluster sizes (2 to 26 vs. 2 to 25 isolates). Spoligotyping alone was the least discriminatory (80.1% clustering, HGI 0.903), with 28 unique types. However, the discriminatory power of spoligotyping was improved when combined with pncA sequencing using the SpoNC approach (61.8% clustering, HGI 0.958). A high proportion of MDR-TB isolates had mutations in pncA (68%, n = 145), and pncA mutations were significantly associated with clustering (p = 0.007 and p = 0.0013 by 24-loci MIRU-VNTR and IS6110-RFLP, respectively), suggesting high rates of resistance to pyrazinamide among all MDR-TB cases and particularly among clustered cases. Conclusion We conclude that SpoNC provides good discrimination for MDR-TB surveillance and early identification of outbreaks in South Africa, with 24-loci MIRU-VNTR applied for pncA wildtype strains as needed.

10.1371_journal.pone.0146340	Access to Bacteriologic-Based Diagnosis in Smear Positive Retreatment Tuberculosis Patients in Rural China: A Cross-Sectional Study in Three Geographic Varied Provinces	Objective To determine factors influencing the utilization and accessibility to bacteriologic-based tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis among sputum smear positive (SS+) retreatment TB patients, and to develop strategies for improving the case detection rate of MDR-TB in rural China. Study Design and Setting A cross-sectional study of SS+ TB retreatment patients was conducted in eight counties from three provinces with different implementation period and strategy of MDR-TB program in China. Demographic and socioeconomic parameters were collected by self-reporting questionnaires. Sputum samples were collected and cultured by the laboratory of county-designated TB clinics and delivered to prefectural Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) labs for DST with 4 first-line anti-TB drugs. Results Among the 196 SS+ retreatment patients, 61.22% received culture tests during current treatment. Patients from more developed regions (OR = 24.0 and 3.6, 95% CI: 8.6-67.3 and 1.1-11.6), with better socio-economic status (OR = 3. 8, 95% CI: 1.3-10.7), who had multiple previous anti-TB treatments (OR = 5.0, 95% CI: 1.6-15.9), and who failed in the most recent anti-TB treatment (OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.0-6.4) were more likely to receive culture tests. The percentage of isolates resistant to any of first-line anti-TB drugs and MDR-TB were 50.0% (95% CI: 39.8%-60.2%) and 30.4%(95% CI: 21.0%-39.8%) respectively. Conclusions Retreatment SS+ TB patients, high risk MDR-TB population, had poor utilization of access to bacteriologic-based TB diagnosis, which is far from optimal. The next step of anti-TB strategy should be focused on how to make bacteriological-based diagnosis cheaper, safer and more maneuverable, and how to assure the DST-guided treatment for these high-risk TB patients.

10.1186_s12879_015_1331_z	Drug resistance characteristics and cluster analysis of M. tuberculosis in Chinese patients with multiple episodes of anti-tuberculosis treatment	Background: Tuberculosis (TB) patients with multiple episodes of anti-TB treatment represent an important source of TB transmission, as well as a serious threat to the control of drug resistant TB, due to the high risk of multidrug and extensively drug resistance (MDR/XDR) and elongating infectiousness of this patient group. In this study we analyzed the possible risk of development and transmission of MDR and XDR in TB patients with multiple episodes of previous treatment history. Methods: The study subjects were pulmonary TB patients who had at least two episodes of previous anti-TB treatment. A total of 166 eligible patients were identified from 10 counties/districts distributed in east, west, north, south and central China. Drug susceptibility test (DST) was performed by proportion method on LJ-media for the 1st line anti-TB drugs and a line probe assay was used to detect mutations related to resistance of the key 2nd-line drugs. Genotyping of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) was performed with MIRU-VNTR and Spoligotyping. Results: Resistances to 1st-line drugs was observed in 122 (73.5 %) of the 166 Mtb isolates with 97 (58.4 %) being MDR-TB. Mutations relevant to 2nd-line drug resistance was seen in 63 isolates, including 35 MDR-TB isolates (30 pre-XDR, 5 XDR-TB). The Spoligotyping revealed 83.1 % Mtb isolates belonged to the Beijing family. The MIRU-VNTR based genotyping revealed 32 (19.3 %) of patients were infected with more than one strain. The number of previous TB treatment episode was found being significantly associated with the risk of MDR-TB and XDR-TB. Among the remaining 134 patients infected with a single Mtb strain, MIRU-VNTR revealed a high homogeneity of strain especially within Beijing family despite the polymorphic variations along with geographic locations. Conclusions: The high genetic relatedness and risk of MDR-TB and subsequent pre-XDR and XDR-TB among repeatedly treated patients suggest the establishment of M/XDR Mtb in this specific patient population. It highlights the urgent needs of providing DST of both 1st-and 2nd-line drugs before and during the medication in China's MDR-TB control program. Furthermore, the possibility of infection with multiple strains should also be considered to be associated with the drug resistance, which calls for the modification of treatment regimen.

10.1590_S1678_9946201658077	A DECADE TREND OF MULTIDRUG RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS IN SAO PAULO STATE, BRAZIL	The aim of this retrospective study was to review all the notified cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Sao Paulo State (Brazil), as well as to describe and discuss the clinical, microbiological and radiologic aspects in a single reference center, within the same state, from 2000 to 2012. There were 1,097 notifications of MDR-TB in Sao Paulo State over this period, 70% affecting men aged on average 38 years (10-77). There was a significant fall in the MDR-TB mortality rate from 30% to 8% (2000-2003 versus 2009-2012). The same trend was observed in the cases studied at the reference center. The number of notified cases increased and death rate reduced from 37.5% (2000-2005) to 3.4% (2006-2012). Among the 48 drug-resistant TB cases, 17 non-tuberculous Mycobacteria were isolated in the sputum culture of nine patients, without any clinical significance. TB and fungus co-infection was diagnosed in 15% (7/48) of these cases: three with confirmed chronic pulmonary aspergillosis and four with positive serological markers for paracoccidioidomycosis. Overall, the reports show that MDR-TB diagnosis and cure rates have increased, while the mortality rate has decreased significantly in Sao Paulo State including in the studied reference center.

10.4415_ANN_16_04_23	Drug-resistant tuberculosis in Naples, 2008-2013	Background. Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is a serious threat in industrialized countries, but information from Southern Italy is lacking. Here, we present the results of a retrospective study of TB cases diagnosed in 2008-2013 in Naples, the largest city in Southern Italy. Methods. Six hundred ninety Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains were isolated at the Ospedali dei Colli of Naples, and resistance to first-line and second-line drugs was determined. Results. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB increased from 2008 to 2013, with 77.4% of strains isolated from migrants from 41 countries. Overall, 4.5% of strains were MDR: Italian-born persons, 2.2%; Romania, 7.5%; Former Soviet Union countries (Ukraine, Russia, Armenia, Georgia), 22.4%; all other foreign countries, 2.0%. Resistance of MDR strains to second-line drugs was high against kanamycin, ofloxacin, capreomycin. Conclusions. MDR-TB in Naples increased in 2008-13 and was observed predominantly in migrants, indicating the need to intensify diagnosis and treatment of these populations in this town.	tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; drug resistance; migrants; Naples; Italy	RISK-FACTORS; IMMIGRATION; COUNTRIES; ELIMINATION; MIGRANTS; AFRICA; EUROPE
pub-0445	Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its Rifampicin resistance at Felege Hiwot and Debre Tabor Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia: A preliminary implementation research	Background: The World Health Organization endorsed GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) assay for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in 2010. However, the practice of using this novel diagnostic method is still limited in a high TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) burden settings, including Ethiopia. Therefore, we conducted this study aimed at describing the first implementation status of Xpert assay in the diagnosis of TB and MDR-TB at Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital (FHRH) and Debre Tabor General Hospital (DTGH), Northwest Ethiopia. Methods: We analyzed the records of 1922 (FHRH=544 and DTGH=1378) presumptive TB patients diagnosed using Xpert test from 1 November 2015 to 30 April 2016 at FHRH and DTGH, Northwest Ethiopia. All patients who had registered data on their sex, age, HIV status, presumptive MDR-TB status and Xpert results were included for analysis. Data were retrieved directly from GeneXpert result registration log book using data extraction sheet. Data were entered, cleaned, and analyzed using SPSS statistical software package; p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Results: Overall Xpert assay properly diagnosed 14.6% of the cases (258/1922). Among these, rifampicin (RIF) resistance was detected at 9.3% (24/258). In the studied settings, clinical data showed that 81.0% (1556/1922) of the cases were MDR-TB. Among the study subjects, 888 (46.2 %) of them were HIV positive. However, TB-HIV co-infection rate was at 41.9% (108/258). Of the total patients registered, 1005 (52.3%) of whom were males. The mean age of patients was 31.1 years with SD of 17.5. Significant predictors of the Xpert test were: age (p=0.000), sex (p=0.009), HIV status (p=0.003) and presumptive MDR-TB (p=0.000). Conclusions: In the studied areas, large proportion of clinically TB suspected patients were wrongly diagnosed with MDR-TB. Therefore, the use of Xpert assay in health settings with no culture facility will decrease the unnecessary use of anti-TB drugs and improve rapid TB, and MDR-TB detection and proper management of the cases.

10.1136_bmjopen_2016_014386	Economic evaluation of a shortened standardised treatment regimen of antituberculosis drugs for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (STREAM): study protocol	Introduction: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) poses a serious financial challenge to health systems and patients. The current treatment for patients with MDR-TB takes up to 24 months to complete. Evidence for a shorter regimen which differs from the standard WHO recommended MDR-TB regimen and typically lasts between 9 and 12 months has been reported from Bangladesh. This evaluation aims to assess the economic impact of a shortened regimen on patients and health systems. This evaluation is innovative as it combines patient and health system costs, as well as operational modelling in assessing the impact. Methods and analysis: An economic evaluation nested in a clinical trial with 2 arms will be performed at 4 facilities. The primary outcome measure is incremental cost to the health system of the study regimen compared with the control regimen. Secondary outcome measures are mean incremental costs incurred by patients by treatment outcome; patient costs by category (direct medical costs, transport, food and accommodation costs, and cost of guardians/accompanying persons and lost time); health systems cost by category and drugs; and costs related to serious adverse events. Ethics and dissemination: The study has been evaluated and approved by the Ethics Advisory Group of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease; South African Medical Research Ethics Committee; Wits Health Consortium Protocol Review Committee; University of the Witwatersrand Human Research Ethics Committee; University of Kwazulu-Natal Biomedical Research Ethics Committee; St Peter TB Specialized Hospital Ethical Review Committee; AHRI-ALERT Ethical Review Committee, and all participants will provide written informed consent.

10.2174_1570180812666151016205422	Progress on the Discovery of Inhibitors of InhA, the FAS II Enoyl-ACP Reductase TB Drug Discovery Targeted on InhA	With ever-increasing drug resistant clinical isolates, novel antibiotics with new targets are urgently needed. Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, showed formidable antibiotics resistance. InhA, the enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase involved in the type II fatty acid synthesis pathway (FASII) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, represents an appealing target for the development of new anti-tuberculosis (TB) agents. Inhibitors against InhA might be ideal lead or antibiotics. The latest development of InhA inhibitors is summarized in this paper.

10.2147_PPA.S116860	Adverse events and patients' perceived health-related quality of life at the end of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment in Namibia	Purpose: The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients completing multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment in Namibia and whether the occurrence of adverse events influenced patients' rating of their HRQoL was evaluated. Patients and methods: A cross-sectional analytic survey of patients completing or who recently completed MDR-TB treatment was conducted. The patients rated their HRQoL using the simplified Short Form-8 (TM) (SF-8) questionnaire consisting of eight Likert-type questions. Three supplemental questions on the adverse events that the patients may have experienced during their MDR-TB treatment were also included. Scoring of HRQoL ratings was norm-based (mean = 50, standard deviation = 10) ranging from 20 (worst health) to 80 (best health), rather than the conventional 0-100 scores. We evaluated the internal consistency of the scale items using the Cronbach's alpha, performed descriptive analyses, and analyzed the association between the patients' HRQoL scores and adverse events. Results: Overall, 36 patients (20 males, 56%) aged 17-54 years (median = 40 years) responded to the questionnaire. The median (range) HRQoL score for the physical component summary was 58.6 (35.3-60.5), while the median score for the mental component summary was 59.3 (26.6-61.9), indicating not-so-high self-rating of health. There was good internal consistency of the scale scores, with a Cronbach's alpha value of >0.80. In all, 32 (89%) of the 36 patients experienced at least one adverse drug event of any severity during their treatment (median events = 3, range 1-6), of which none was life-threatening. The occurrence of adverse events was not related to HRQoL scores. For patients reporting zero to two events, the median (range) HRQoL score was 56.8 (44.4-56.8), while for those reporting three or more events, the median score was 55.2 (38.6-56.8); P=0.34 for difference between these scores. Conclusion: Patients completing treatment for MDR-TB in Namibia tended to score moderately low on their HRQoL, using the generic SF-8 questionnaire. The occurrence of adverse events did not lead to lower HRQoL scores upon treatment completion.	drug safety; patient-reported health outcomes; SF-8 (TM) questionnaire; second-line tuberculosis drugs; Namibia	TB TREATMENT; MDR-TB; POPULATION; ALPHA; SF-8
10.4314_ahs.v16i2.30	Thyroid function in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients with or without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection before commencement of MDR-TB drug regimen	Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are known to cause abnormal thyroid function. There is little information on whether HIV infection aggravates alteration of thyroid function in patients with MDR-TB. Objectives: This study was carried out to determine if HIV co-infection alters serum levels of thyroid hormones (T3, T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in patients with MDR-TB patients and to find out the frequency of subclinical thyroid dysfunction before the commencement of MDR-TB therapy. Methods: This observational and cross-sectional study involved all the newly admitted patients in MDR-TB Referral Centre, University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria between July 2010 and December 2014. Serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4) and free triiodothyronine (fT3) were determined using ELISA. Results: Enrolled were 115 patients with MDR-TB, out of which 22 (19.13%) had MDR-TB/HIV co-infection. Sick euthyroid syndrome (SES), subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism were observed in 5 (4.35%), 9 (7.83%) and 2 (1.74%) patients respectively. The median level of TSH was insignificantly higher while the median levels of T3 and T4 were insignificantly lower in patients with MDR-TB/HIV co-infection compared with patients with MDRT-TB only. Conclusion: It could be concluded from this study that patients with MDR-TB/HIV co-infection have a similar thyroid function as patients having MDR-TB without HIV infection before commencement of MDR-TB drug regimen. Also, there is a possibility of subclinical thyroid dysfunction in patients with MDR-TB/HIV co-infection even, before the commencement of MDR-TB therapy.

10.1155_2016_3474396	Development of Au-Nanoprobes Combined with Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification for Detection of Isoniazid Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is Mycobacterium tuberculosis that does not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin, so the condition worsens continuously and creates difficulties for treatment by public health control programmes, especially in developing countries. The real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with agarose gel electrophoresis or strip tests is useful molecular tools for diagnosis of MDR-TB. Novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) can also detect drug resistance, which is a one-point mutation, by designing inner primers of 5' end specific with the mutant. Au-nanoprobes on hybridisation with LAMP products containing target-specific sequences remain red, whereas test samples without specific sequences in the probe turn purple due to salt-induced aggregation of the Au-nanoprobes. In this study, a strategy was designed based on the LAMP of a DNA sample coupled to specific Au-nanoprobes, which showed the potential to provide a rapid and sensitive method for detecting isoniazid resistance at katG gene position 315 (G -> C). 46 clinical samples were tested and showed 100% specificity and sensitivity compared with Genotype (R) MDR-TB Plus. This method was advantageous because it is rapid, cheap, specific, and sensitive. Further, it does not require thermal cycles for MDR-TB detection.		NANOPARTICLES; MUTATION
10.1155_2016_2628913	Resistance to Second-Line Antituberculosis Drugs and Delay in Drug Susceptibility Testing among Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients in Shanghai	Introduction. Second-line antituberculosis drugs (SLDs) are used for treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Prolonged delays before confirming MDR-TB with drug susceptibility testing (DST) could result in transmission of drug-resistant strains and inappropriate use of SLDs, thereby increasing the risk of resistance to SLDs. This study investigated the diagnostic delay in DST and prevalence of baseline SLD resistance in Shanghai and described the distribution of SLD resistance with varied delays to DST. Methods. All registered patients from 2011 to 2013 in Shanghai were enrolled. Susceptibility to ofloxacin, amikacin, kanamycin, and capreomycin was tested. Total delay in DST completion was measured from the onset of symptoms to reporting DST results. Results. Resistance to SLDs was tested in 217 of the 276 MDR-TB strains, with 118 (54.4%) being resistant to at least one of the four SLDs. The median total delay in DST was 136 days. Patients with delay longer than median days were roughly twice more likely to have resistance to at least one SLD (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.19-4.11). Conclusions. During prolonged delay in DST, primary and acquired resistance to SLDs might occur more frequently. Rapid diagnosis of MDR-TB, improved nosocomial infection controls, and regulated treatment are imperative to prevent SLD resistance.

10.2147_PPA.S105655	Social support received by multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients and related factors: a cross-sectional study in Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China	Objectives: The objective of this study is to assess the social support received by patients diagnosed with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China and the factors that may have influenced it. Methods: A total of 220 MDR-TB patients participated in the questionnaire-based survey, and the data from 212 valid questionnaires were analyzed. The respondents reported their sociodemographic status, disease features, and attitudes toward the disease. The social support rating scale was used to measure the patients' social support scores. An Independent Samples t-test, one-way analysis of variance, and a multiple linear regression model were used to analyze the related factors for the social support scores. Result: The average social support score of each MDR-TB patient was 32.56 +/- 7.86. Participants who were single, widowed or divorced, retired, and had fewer family members and lower family income were found to have lower social support scores. Participants unwilling to disclose their disease tended to have less social support (31.59<34.23, P=0.010). Participants who perceived great help from health care workers reported higher social support rating scale scores than those who perceived no help (35.36>29.89, P=0.014). Conclusion: MDR-TB patients in Zhejiang Province were shown to have a low level of social support. Patients who were not married, had smaller families, and lower family income received less social support, suggesting that family harmony could be an important source of social support. Patients' self-isolation may contribute to a decrease in the amount of support they receive from their surroundings. Health care organizations need to offer more social support to MDR-TB patients.	multidrug-resistant TB; social support; factors	WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE; LIFE; SURVIVORS; STRESS
10.1099_jmm.0.000203	Genotypic assessment of drug-resistant tuberculosis in Baghdad and other Iraqi provinces using low-cost and low-density DNA microarrays	We report on a molecular investigation carried out to ascertain the prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and the specific gene mutations responsible for resistance to rifampicin (RIF). and/or isoniazid (INH) in Iraq. In total, 110 clinical isolates from category II TB cases from Baghdad (58 %) and several Iraqi provinces (42 %) were analysed using colorimetric, low-cost and low-density (LCD) microarrays (MYCO-Direct and MYCO-Resist LCD array kits) to identify the point mutations responsible for resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. We found 76 patients (69.1 %) had resistant strains, of which 40 (36 %) were multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB. Where mono-resistance was identified, it was found to be predominantly to RIF (83 %). The most common mutations were rpoB S531 L (50 %), inhA C15T (25 %) and katG S315T (15 %). The most common MDR -TB genotypes were rpoB S531 L with inhA C15T (60 %) and rpoB S531 L with katG S315T (20 %). Where phenotypic analysis of clinical isolates was also performed, genotypic data were found to show excellent correlation with phenotypic results. Correlation was found between the MYCO-Resist LCD array and GenoType MTBDRp/us for detection of resistance to RIF. Our study shows MDR -TB in 36 % of category II TB cases in Baghdad and surrounding Iraqi provinces, which reflects the World Health Organization findings based on phenotypic studies. Diagnosis of TB and MDR -TB using culture-based tests is a significant impediment to global TB control. The LCD arrays investigated herein are easy to use, sensitive and specific molecular tools for TB resistance profiling in resource-limited laboratory settings.

10.2174_1573413711666150901203515	Nanoformulations of Moxifloxacin, Econozole and Ethionamide as Novel Treatment Regimens Against MDR TB - An Experimental Study	Background: The drugs used for treating multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are extremely toxic, expensive and less potent with limited sterilizing activity. With the emergence of several drug resistant strains of tuberculosis there is a pressing need for new drug development. In the current study, clinically used anti-infective antibiotics such as moxifloxacin (MOX), econazole (ECZ) and ethionamide (ETH) were encapsulated in poly-(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoaprticles and evaluated for their therapeutic efficacy in a MDR-TB infected mouse model. It is envisaged that such formulations would improve patient compliance and reduction in the number of dosages. Methods: Moxifloxacin and ethionamide nanoparticles were prepared by multiple emulsion and solvent evaporation method while econazole nanoparticles were prepared by nanopreciptitation method. Mice were aerosol infected with MDR-TB JAL11050 and treated with free drugs and drugs encapsulated in PLGA nanoparticles. The lungs and spleen were evaluated for reduction in bacterial load (colony forming units, CFU) and histopathological studies. Results: Moxifloxacin, econazole and ethionamide were encapsulated with high efficiency in PLGA nanoparticles. Eight weeks of oral administration of individual nanoformulations (PLGA-NP-ECZ / PLGA-NP-MOX / PLGA-NP-ETH) showed limited reduction of CFUs in lungs and spleen while with 8 doses of a combination of the three nanoformulations (PLGA-NP-ECZ+PLGA-NPMOX+PLGA-NP-ETH) there was a significant reduction in CFUs in lungs as well as in spleen. Corroborating the results with histopathology revealed that the combination of 3-drugs loaded nanoparticles decreased the congestion in the lungs to 50%. Conclusion: Chemotherapy of MDR-TB infected mice with weekly doses of 3-drugs nanoformulations (PLGA-NP-ECZ+PLGA-NP-MOX+PLGA-NP-ETH) led to the clearance of bacilli from lungs and the spleen. This is a first report on the potential efficacy of a combination of ECZ, MOX and ETH nanoparticles against MDR-TB.

10.5578_mb.10339	Multicenter Evaluation of the Indirect Nitrate Reductase Assay for the Rapid Detection of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is defined as resistance to at least isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF), and it complicates the implementation of tuberculosis control programmes. The rapid detection of MDR-TB is crucial to reduce the transmission of disease. The nitrate reductase assay (NRA) is one of the colorimetric susceptibility test methods for rapid detection of MDR-TB and based on the ability of reduction of nitrate to nitrite by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the NRA for the rapid detection of MDR-TB. A total of 237 M.tuberculosis complex (MTC) isolates that were identified by the same method (BD MGIT (TM) TBc Identification Test, USA) from nine different medical centers in Turkey were included in the study. The susceptibility results of the isolates against INH and RIF obtained by reference test (Bactec MGIT (TM) 960, BD, USA) were then compared with NRA. In order to ensure consistency between centers, Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium with antibiotics and without antibiotics (growth control) and Griess reagent solution were prepared in a single center (Ondokuz Mayis University School of Medicine, Medical Microbiology Department) and sent to all participant centers with the standardized test procedure. After the inoculation of bacteria into the test tubes, the tubes were incubated at 37 degrees C, and after seven days of incubation, 500 mu l Griess reagent was added to the LJ medium without antibiotics. If a color change was observed, an equal volume of Griess reagent was added to test LJ media with antibiotics. When a color change was observed in LJ media with antibiotics, it was considered that the isolate was resistant to tested antibiotics. Among 237 MTC isolates, 16 were resistant only to INH and nine were resistant only to RIF; 93 isolates (39.2%) were resistant (MDR) and 119 isolates (50.2%) were susceptible to both of the drugs determined with the reference susceptibility test. In the study, five INH-resistant isolates determined with reference method were found susceptible with NRT and eight INH-susceptible isolates determined with reference method were found resistant with NRT. In contrast, one RIF-resistant isolate determined with reference method was found susceptible with NRT and three RIF-susceptible determined isolates were found resistant with NRT. Accordingly, the concordance rate between the reference method and NRA were estimated as 94.5% for INH and 98.3% for RIF. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of NRA were detected as 95.4%, 93.7%, 92.8% and 96% for INH, and 99%, 97.8%, 97.1% and 99.2% for RIF, respectively. The results of the 111 isolates were obtained on the seventh day, while the rest of the results were obtained between 10-14 days. In conclusion, the data of this multicenter study showed that NRA is a reliable, relatively inexpensive and practical method to perform for the rapid detection of MDR-TB.

10.1155_2016_9051865	Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis and Its Association with Adrenal Insufficiency: Assessment with the Low-Dose ACTH Stimulation Test	Background. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major public health care concern that affects the life of millions of people around the world. The association of tuberculosis and adrenal insufficiency is well known; however, it is thought to be less prevalent every time. A spike in TB incidence and a lack of evidence of this association in patients with MDR-TB call for reassessment of an illness (adrenal dysfunction) that if not diagnosed could seriously jeopardize patients' health. Objective. To determine the prevalence of adrenocortical insufficiency in patients with MDR-TB using the low-dose (1 mu g) ACTH stimulation test at baseline and at 6-12 months of follow-up after antituberculosis treatment and culture conversion. Methods. A total of 48 men or women, aged >18 years (HIV-negative patients diagnosed with pulmonary MDR-TB) were included in this prospective observational study. Blood samples for serumcortisol were taken at baseline and 30 and 60minutes after 1 mu g ACTH stimulation at our tertiary level university hospital before and after antituberculosis treatment. Results. Forty-seven percent of subjects had primary MDR-TB; 43.8% had type 2 diabetes; none were HIV-positive. We found at enrollment 2 cases (4.2%) of adrenal insufficiency taking 500 nmol/L as the standard cutoff point value and 4 cases (8.3%) alternatively, using 550 nmol/L. After antituberculosis intensive phase drug-treatment and a negative mycobacterial culture (10.2 +/- 3.6 months) adrenocortical function was restored in all cases. Conclusions. In patients with MDR-TB, using the low-dose ACTH stimulation test, a low prevalence of mild adrenal insufficiency was observed. After antituberculosis treatment adrenal function was restored in all cases. Given the increasing and worrying epidemic of MDR-TB these findings have important clinical implications that may help clinicians and patients make better decisions when deciding to test for adrenocortical dysfunction or treat insufficient stimulated cortisol levels in the setting of MDR-TB.

10.1007_s11418_015_0937_1	In vitro antituberculosis activity of diterpenoids from the Vietnamese medicinal plant Croton tonkinensis	Diterpenoids from the Vietnamese medicinal plant Croton tonkinensis are rich in ent-kaurane, kaurane and the grayanane class and are valuable intermediate plant metabolites with different bioactivities. In this study, we report the antituberculosis activity of these diterpenoids against both susceptible and resistant strains of M. tuberculosis for the first time. All of the ent-kaurane, kaurane and grayanane diterpenoids showed high to moderate activity against Mycobacterium. The highest antituberculosis activity was observed for ent-1 beta,7 alpha,14 beta-triace-toxykaur-16-en-15-one (cpp604), with MIC values of 0.78, 1.56 and 3.12-12.5 mu g/ml against H37Ra, H37Rv and all other resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis examined. In addition, other ent-kaurane-type diterpenoids also showed very high activities against mycobacterium, including cpp609 (1.56 mu g/ml), cpp610 (1.56 mu g/ml), cpp601 (3.12-6.25 mu g/ml), cpp602 (3.12-6.25 mu g/ml), cpp607 (3.12-6.25 mu g/ml) and cpp608 (3.12-6.25 mu g/ml). From the structure-activity relationship, functional groups R3 and R5 of the ent-kaurane skeleton were found to modulate the antimycobacterial activity.

10.1111_tmi.12625	Evaluation of community-based treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis in Bangladesh	OBJECTIVE Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) threatens global TB control because it is difficult to diagnose and treat. Community-based programmatic management of drug-resistant TB (cPMDT) has made therapy easier for patients, but data on these models are scarce. Bangladesh initiated cPMDT in 2012, and in 2013, we sought to evaluate programme performance. METHODS In this retrospective review, we abstracted demographic, clinical, microbiologic and treatment outcome data for all patients enrolled in the cPMDT programme over 6 months in three districts of Bangladesh. We interviewed a convenience sample of patients about their experience in the programme. RESULTS Chart review was performed on 77 patients. Sputum smears and cultures were performed, on average, once every 1.35 and 1.36 months, respectively. Among 74 initially culture-positive patients, 70 (95%) converted their cultures and 69 (93%) patients converted the cultures before the sixth month. Fifty-two (68%) patients had evidence of screening for adverse events. We found written documentation of musculoskeletal complaints for 16 (21%) patients, gastrointestinal adverse events for 16 (21%), hearing loss for eight (10%) and psychiatric events for four (5%) patients; conversely, on interview of 60 patients, 55 (92%) reported musculoskeletal complaints, 54 (90%) reported nausea, 36 (60%) reported hearing loss, and 36 (60%) reported psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS The cPMDT programme in Bangladesh appears to be programmatically feasible and clinically effective; however, inadequate monitoring of adverse events raises some concern. As the programme is brought to scale nationwide, renewed efforts at monitoring adverse events should be prioritised.	Tuberculosis drug-resistance community treatment Bangladesh	MDR-TB TREATMENT
10.1128_AAC.01035_15	In Vitro Activity of beta-Lactams in Combination with beta-Lactamase Inhibitors against Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates	The combination of beta-lactams and beta-lactamase inhibitors has been shown to have potent in vitro activity against multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates. In order to identify the most potent beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination against MDR-TB, we selected nine beta-lactams and three beta-lactamase inhibitors, which belong to different subgroups. A total of 121 MDR-TB strains were included in this study. Out of the beta-lactams used herein, biapenem was the most effective against MDR-TB and had an MIC50 value of 8 mu g/ml. However, after the addition of clavulanate or sulbactam, meropenem exhibited the most potent anti-MDR-TB activity with an MIC50 value of 4 mu g/ml. For meropenem, 76 (62.8%), 41 (33.9%), and 22 (18.2%) of the 121 MDR-TB strains were subjected to a synergistic effect when the drug was combined with sulbactam, tazobactam, or clavulanate, respectively. Further statistical analysis revealed that significantly more strains experienced a synergistic effect when exposed to the combination of meropenem with sulbactam than when exposed to meropenem in combination with tazobactam or clavulanate, respectively (P < 0.01). In addition, a total of 10.7% (13/121) of isolates harbored mutations in the blaC gene, with two different nucleotide substitutions: AGT333AGG and ATC786ATT. For the strains with a Ser111Arg substitution in BlaC, a better synergistic effect was observed in the meropenem-clavulanate and in the amoxicillin-clavulanate combinations than that in a synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) group. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the combination of meropenem and sulbactam shows the most potent activity against MDR-TB isolates. In addition, the Ser111Arg substitution of BlaC may be associated with an increased susceptibility of MDR-TB isolates to meropenem and amoxicillin in the presence of clavulanate.

10.7150_ijbs.13805	A Group of Novel Serum Diagnostic Biomarkers for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis by iTRAQ-2D LC-MS/MS and Solexa Sequencing	The epidemic of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), especially multidrug-resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) presented a major challenge for TB treatment today. We performed iTRAQ labeling coupled with two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (2D LC-MS/MS) and Solexa sequencing among MDR-TB patients, drug-sensitive tuberculosis (DS-TB) patients, and healthy controls. A total of 50 differentially expressed proteins and 43 differentially expressed miRNAs (fold change > 1.50 or <0.60, P<0.05) were identified in the MDR-TB patients compared to both DS-TB patients and healthy controls. We found that 22.00% of differentially expressed proteins and 32.56% of differentially expressed miRNAs were related, and could construct a network mainly in complement and coagulation cascades. Significant differences in CD44 antigen (CD44), coagulation factor XI (F11), kininogen-1 (KNG1), miR-4433b-5p, miR-424-5p, and miR-199b-5p were found among MDR-TB patients, DS-TB patients and healthy controls (P<0.05) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and SYBR green qRT-PCR validation. A strong negative correlation, consistent with the target gene prediction, was found between miR-199b-5p and KNG1 (r=-0.232, P=0.017). Moreover, we established the MDR-TB diagnostic model based on five biomarkers (CD44, KNG1, miR-4433b-5p, miR-424-5p, and miR-199b-5p). Our study proposes potential biomarkers for MDR-TB diagnosis, and also provides a new experimental basis to understand the pathogenesis of MDR-TB.	multidrug-resistance tuberculosis; proteomic; transcriptomic; serum; biomarkers	TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; POTENTIAL BIOMARKERS; IDENTIFICATION; HAPTOGLOBIN; FIBRONECTIN; CARCINOMA; DISEASE; CD44
10.1016_j.bjid.2015.09.011	Resistance patterns, prevalence, and predictors of fluoroquinolones resistance in multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients	Background: Fluoroquinolones are the backbone of multidrug resistant tuberculosis treatment regimens. Despite the high burden of multidrug resistant tuberculosis in the country, little is known about drug resistance patterns, prevalence, and predictors of fluoroquinolones resistance among multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients from Pakistan. Objective: To evaluate drug resistance patterns, prevalence, and predictors of fluoroquinolones resistance in multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at a programmatic management unit of drug resistant tuberculosis, Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar, Pakistan. Two hundred and forty-three newly diagnosed multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients consecutively enrolled for treatment at study site from January 1, 2012 to July 28, 2013 were included in the study. A standardized data collection form was used to collect patients' socio-demographic, microbiological, and clinical data. SPSS 16 was used for data analysis. Results: High degree of drug resistance (median 5 drugs, range 2-8) was observed. High proportion of patients was resistant to all five first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs (62.6%), and more than half were resistant to second line drugs (55.1%). The majority of the patients were ofloxacin resistant (52.7%). Upon multivariate analysis previous tuberculosis treatment at private (OR= 1.953, p = 0.034) and public private mix (OR = 2.824, p = 0.046) sectors were predictors of ofloxacin resistance. Conclusion: The high degree of drug resistance observed, particularly to fluoroquinolones, is alarming. We recommend the adoption of more restrictive policies to control nonprescription sale of fluoroquinolones, its rational use by physicians, and training doctors in both private and public-private mix sectors to prevent further increase in fluoroquinolones resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains.

10.1016_j.tube.2015.10.012	Novel mutations conferring resistance to kanamycin in Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from Northern India	Twenty-nine Kanamycin resistant clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from Northern India were screened to evaluate genetic mutations in rrs gene, eis gene with its promoter, and whiB7 gene along with its 5'UTR. 14 strains (-48.0%) collectively exhibited mutations in rrs, eis or whiB7 target regions. While the highest frequency of mutations was found in rrs gene, eis and whiB7 loci displayed novel mutations. The novel mutations displayed by eis and whiB7 loci were found to be associated specifically with the Kanamycin resistance as none of the twenty nine Kanamycin sensitive strains harbor them. The inclusion of novel mutations of eis and whiB7 loci will be useful in improving the specificity of future diagnostics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.1128_JCM.01904_15	Multicenter Evaluation of Anyplex Plus MTB/NTM MDR-TB Assay for Rapid Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex and Multidrug-Resistant Isolates in Pulmonary and Extrapulmonary Specimens	The rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) and the detection of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains are critical for successful public health interventions. Therefore, TB diagnosis requires the availability of diagnostic tools that allow the rapid detection of M. tuberculosis and drug resistance in clinical samples. Here, we performed a multicenter study to evaluate the performance of the Seegene Anyplex MTB/NTM MDR-TB assay, a new molecular method based on a multiplex real-time PCR system, for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and genetic determinants of drug resistance. In total, the results for 755 samples (534 pulmonary and 221 extrapulmonary samples) were compared with the results of smears and cultures. For pulmonary specimens, the sensitivities of the Anyplex assay and acid-fast bacillus smear testing were 86.4% and 75.0%, respectively, and the specificities were 99% and 99.4%. For extrapulmonary specimens, the sensitivities of the Anyplex assay and acid-fast bacillus smear testing were 83.3% and 50.0%, respectively, and the specificities of both were 100%. The negative and positive predictive values of the Anyplex assay for pulmonary specimens were 97% and 100%, respectively, and those for extrapulmonary specimens were 84.6% and 100%. The sensitivities of the Anyplex assay for detecting isoniazid resistance in MTBC strains from pulmonary and extrapulmonary specimens were 83.3% and 50%, respectively, while the specificities were 100% for both specimen types. These results demonstrate that the Anyplex MTB/NTM MDR-TB assay is an efficient and rapid method for the diagnosis of pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB and the detection of isoniazid resistance.

10.1371_journal.pone.0145380	Major Challenges in Clinical Management of TB/HIV Coinfected Patients in Eastern Europe Compared with Western Europe and Latin America	Objectives Rates of TB/HIV coinfection and multi-drug resistant (MDR)-TB are increasing in Eastern Europe (EE). We aimed to study clinical characteristics, factors associated with MDR-TB and predicted activity of empiric anti-TB treatment at time of TB diagnosis among TB/HIV coinfected patients in EE, Western Europe (WE) and Latin America (LA). Design and Methods Between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013, 1413 TB/HIV patients (62 clinics in 19 countries in EE, WE, Southern Europe (SE), and LA) were enrolled. Results Significant differences were observed between EE (N = 844), WE (N = 152), SE (N = 164), and LA (N = 253) in the proportion of patients with a definite TB diagnosis (47%, 71%, 72% and 40%, p<0.0001), MDR-TB (40%, 5%, 3% and 15%, p<0.0001), and use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) (17%, 40%, 44% and 35%, p<0.0001). Injecting drug use (adjusted OR (aOR) = 2.03 (95% CI 1.00-4.09), prior anti-TB treatment (3.42 (1.88-6.22)), and living in EE (7.19 (3.28-15.78)) were associated with MDR-TB. Among 585 patients with drug susceptibility test (DST) results, the empiric (i.e. without knowledge of the DST results) anti-TB treatment included >= 3 active drugs in 66% of participants in EE compared with 90-96% in other regions (p<0.0001). Conclusions In EE, TB/HIV patients were less likely to receive a definite TB diagnosis, more likely to house MDR-TB and commonly received empiric anti-TB treatment with reduced activity. Improved management of TB/HIV patients in EE requires better access to TB diagnostics including DSTs, empiric anti-TB therapy directed at both susceptible and MDR-TB, and more widespread use of cART.

10.1186_s12866_015_0613_3	Trends in molecular epidemiology of drug-resistant tuberculosis in Republic of Karelia, Russian Federation	"Background: Russian Republic of Karelia is located at the Russian-Finnish border. It contains most of the historical Karelia land inhabited with autochthonous Karels and more recently migrated Russians. Although tuberculosis (TB) incidence in Karelia is decreasing, it remains high (45.8/100 000 in 2014) with the rate of multi-drug resistance (MDR) among newly diagnosed TB patients reaching 46.5 %. The study aimed to genetically characterize Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates obtained at different time points from TB patients from Karelia to gain insight into the phylogeographic specificity of the circulating genotypes and to assess trends in evolution of drug resistant subpopulations. Methods: The sample included 150 M. tuberculosis isolates: 78 isolated in 2013-2014 (""new"" collection) and 72 isolated in 2006 (""old"" collection). Drug susceptibility testing was done by the method of absolute concentrations. Spoligotyping was used to test genotype-specific markers of a Latin-American-Mediterranean (LAM) family and its sublineages as well as a Beijing B0/W148-cluster. Results: The largest spoligotypes were SIT1 (Beijing family, n = 42) and SIT40 (T family, n = 5). Beijing family was the largest (n = 43) followed by T (n = 11), Ural (n = 10) and LAM (n = 8). Successful Russian clone, Beijing B0/W148, was identified in 15 (34.9 %) of 43 Beijing isolates; all B0/W148 isolates were drug-resistant. Seven of 8 LAM isolates belonged to the RD115/LAM-RUS branch, 1 -to the LAM RD174/RD-Rio sublineage. MDR was found in Beijing (32/43), Ural (3/10), and LAM (3/8). In contrast, all T isolates were pansusceptible. Comparison of drug resistant subgroups of the new and old collections showed an increasing prevalence of the B0/W148 clonal cluster, from 18.0 % (mainly polyresistant) in 2006 to 32.6 % in 2014 (mainly MDR and pre-XDR). The West-east increasing gradient is observed for the Ural genotype that may be defined a 'Russian' strain. In contrast, the spoligotype SIT40 of the T family appears to be a historical Karelian strain. Conclusions: Circulation of the MDR M. tuberculosis isolates of the Beijing genotype and its B0/W148 cluster continues to critically influence the current situation with the MDR-TB control in northwestern Russia including the Republic of Karelia. Revealed phylogeographic patterns of some genotypes reflect a complex demographic history of Karelia within the course of the 20th century."

10.1371_journal.pone.0144656	Implementing the Xpert (R) MTB/RIF Diagnostic Test for Tuberculosis and Rifampicin Resistance: Outcomes and Lessons Learned in 18 Countries	Background The Xpert (R) MTB/RIF (Xpert) is an automated molecular test for simultaneous detection of tuberculosis (TB) and rifampicin resistance, recommended by the World Health Organization as the preferred diagnostic method for individuals presumed to have multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) or HIV-associated TB. We describe the performance of Xpert and key lessons learned during two years of implementation under routine conditions in 33 projects located in 18 countries supported by Medecins Sans Frontieres across varied geographic, epidemiological and clinical settings. Methods Xpert was used following three strategies: the first being as the initial test, with microscopy in parallel, for all presumptive TB cases; the second being only for patients at risk of MDR-TB, or with HIV-associated TB, or presumptive paediatric TB; and the third being as the initial test for these high-risk patients plus as an add-on test to microscopy in others. Routine laboratory data were collected, using laboratory registers. Qualitative data such as logistic aspects, human resources, and tool acceptance were collected using a questionnaire. Findings In total, 52,863 samples underwent Xpert testing from April 2011 to December 2012. The average MTB detection rate was 18.5%, 22.3%, and 11.6% for the three different strategies respectively. Analysis of the results on samples tested in parallel showed that using Xpert as add-on test to microscopy would have increased laboratory TB confirmation by 49.7%, versus 42.3% for Xpert replacing microscopy. The main limitation of the test was the high rate of inconclusive results, which correlated with factors such as defective modules, cartridge version (G3 vs. G4) and staff experience. Operational and logistical hurdles included infrastructure renovation, basic computer training, regular instrument troubleshooting and maintenance, all of which required substantial and continuous support. Conclusion The implementation of Xpert was feasible and significantly increased TB detection compared to microscopy, despite the high rate of inconclusive results. Xpert implementation was accompanied by considerable operational and logistical challenges. To further decentralize diagnosis, simpler, low-cost TB technologies well-suited to low-resource settings are still urgently needed.		ASSAY

In this study, several analytical techniques including NMR, FT-ICR, MALDI-MS, and LC-MS are used to study different aspects of the Copper-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-Amikacin complex. The Cu(II) cation and the aggregate formed by PEG serve as a carrier for the antibiotic. Several Cu-PEG-Amikacin complex variations were tested against NIH-NIAID cell lines containing both resistant and nonresistant strains of M. tuberculosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.2807_1560_7917.ES.2015.20.49.30087	Tuberculosis treatment outcome in the European Union and European Economic Area: an analysis of surveillance data from 2002-2011	Monitoring the treatment outcome (TO) of tuberculosis (TB) is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention and to identify potential barriers for TB control. The global target is to reach a treatment success rate (TSR) of at least 85%. We aimed to assess the TB TO in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) between 2002 and 2011, and to identify factors associated with unsuccessful treatment. Only 18 countries reported information on TO for the whole observation period accounting for 250,854 new culture-confirmed pulmonary TB cases. The 85% target of TSR was not reached in any year between 2002 and 2011 and was on average 78%. The TSR for multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB cases at 24-month follow-up was 49%. In the multivariable regression model, unsuccessful treatment was significantly associated with increasing age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.02 per a one-year increase, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.02), MDR-TB (OR = 8.7, 95% CI: 5.09-14.97), male sex (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.28-1.52), and foreign origin (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.03-1.70). The data highlight that special efforts are required for patients with MDR-TB and the elderly aged = 65 years, who have particularly low TSR. To allow for valid monitoring at EU level all countries should aim to report TO for all TB cases.		PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; RISK-FACTORS; DEATH; COUNTRIES
10.1186_s40360_015_0036_7	Comparing amikacin and kanamycin-induced hearing loss in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment under programmatic conditions in a Namibian retrospective cohort	Background: Amikacin and kanamycin are mainly used for treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), especially in developing countries where the burden of MDR-TB is highest. Their protracted use in MDR-TB treatment is known to cause dose-dependent irreversible hearing loss, requiring hearing aids, cochlear implants or rehabilitation. Therapeutic drug monitoring and regular audiological assessments may help to prevent or detect the onset of hearing loss, but these services are not always available or affordable in many developing countries. We aimed to compare the cumulative incidence of hearing loss among patients treated for MDR-TB with amikacin or kanamycin-based regimens, and to identify the most-at-risk patients, based on the real-life clinical practice experiences in Namibia. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients treated with amikacin or kanamycin-based regimens in four public sector MDR-TB treatment sites in Namibia between June 2004 and March 2014. Patients were audiologically assessed as part of clinical care. The study outcome was the occurrence of any hearing loss. Data were manually extracted from patients' treatment records. We compared proportions using the Chi-square test; applied stratified analysis and logistic regression to study the risk of hearing loss and to identify the most-at-risk patients through effect-modification analysis. A P-value < 0.05 was statistically significant. Results: All 353 patients had normal baseline hearing, 46 % were HIV co-infected. Cumulative incidence of any hearing loss was 58 %, which was mostly bilateral (83 %), and mild (32 %), moderate (23 %), moderate-severe (16 %), severe (10 %), or profound (15 %). Patients using amikacin had a greater risk of developing the more severe forms of hearing loss than those using kanamycin (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 4.0, 95 % CI: 1.5-10.8). Patients co-infected with HIV (OR = 3.4, 95 % CI: 1.1-10.6), males (OR = 4.5, 95 % 1.5-13.4) and those with lower baseline body weight (40-59 kg, OR = 2.8, 95 % CI: 1.1-6.8), were most-at-risk of developing hearing loss. Conclusion: Amikacin use in the long-term MDR-TB treatment led to a higher risk of occurrence of the more severe forms of hearing loss compared to kanamycin use. Males, patients with low baseline body weight and those coinfected with HIV were most-at-risk. MDR-TB treatment programmes should consider replacing amikacin with kanamycin and strengthen the routine renal, serum therapeutic drug levels and audiometric monitoring in the most-at-risk patients treated with aminoglycosides.

10.1016_j.pneumo.2015.05.003	Children exposed to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: How should we manage? Analysis of 46 child contacts and review of the literature	Introduction.-Tuberculosis-related morbidity and mortality remain important. Emergence and diffusion of multidrug-resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global public health concern. Cases of MDR-TB in children are a sentinel event indicating the spread of a mycobacterial strain within a community. Latent TB precedes MDR-TB and screening and follow-up of contact individuals are key points of TB infection control. Methods.-We performed the case-investigation of 20 adult cases of MDR-TB managed in our institution. Results.-Forty-six pediatric contact individuals were identified. A high proportion of these children were lost to follow-up (80% at 12 months), showing that monitoring this reservoir population with migrant history is challenging. Five (11%) children presented a secondary infection: one child was diagnosed with active TB infection (positive tuberculin skin test associated with abnormalities on chest computer tomography [CT] scan). Four children were diagnosed with latent TB infection (isolated positive tuberculin skin test with normal CT scan). Two of these children received a treatment adjusted to the strain of the index case. Discussion.-In the setting of emerging MDR-TB, tuberculin skin test may be likely replaced by specific interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA), independent of prior BCG vaccination. In addition, chest CT scan is preferred to chest X-ray to detect TB lesions. The management of latent TB infection is controversial: immediate treatment with second-line anti-TB drugs adapted to the index case strain or, consistently with WHO guidelines, a simple follow-up with subsequent treatment in case of active TB.

10.1016_j.pneumo.2014.12.009	Extensively drug resistant tuberculosis in Ivory Coast	"Introduction. - The emergence of tuberculosis with ultraresistant bacilli (TB-UR or XDR-TB) came to increase the threat concerning the progress realized in tuberculosis control. This observation establishes the only case of XDR-TB documented and published since the beginning of pharmacoresistant tuberculosis management in Ivory Coast from 2000 till 2010. This case was diagnosed in 2005 at a HIV-negative 32-year-old woman, initially declared MDR-TB. Looking forward to a treatment of category IV, she was treated by therapeutic truncated protocols recombining antituberculous molecules to which the patient was still sensitive. This treatment (PAS, cycloserin, cipi-ofoxacin, ethionamid, ethambutol and kanamycin) was introduced after 9 months of waiting and was completely led in ambulatory under the supervision of a member of the family. The diagnosis of XDR-TB concerned new tests of sensibility spread to second line antituberculous drugs in front of the absence of spits negativation at the end of 14 months of a second line treatment marked by frequent stock shortages. The death arose at M19 of treatment by chronic heart pulmonary. Conclusion. - XDR-TB remains dark prognosis and is almost synonymic of ""death sentence"" in our countries with limited resources. The application of the international recommendations for. tuberculosis management and better accessibility to antituberculous second line drugs would allow to prevent the appearance of such forms of tuberculosis.

10.1128_AAC.01028_15	Genotypic Analysis of Genes Associated with Independent Resistance and Cross-Resistance to Isoniazid and Ethionamide in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Clinical Isolates	Ethionamide (ETH) is an antibiotic used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) (MDR-TB), and its use may be limited with the emergence of resistance in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis population. ETH resistance in M. tuberculosis is phenomenon independent or cross related when accompanied with isoniazid (INH) resistance. In most cases, resistance to INH and ETH is explained by mutations in the inhA promoter and in the following genes: katG, ethA, ethR, mshA, ndh, and inhA. We sequenced the above genes in 64 M. tuberculosis isolates (n = 57 ETH-resistant MDR-TB isolates; n = 3 ETH-susceptible MDR-TB isolates; and n = 4 fully susceptible isolates). Each isolate was tested for susceptibility to first-and second-line drugs using the agar proportion method. Mutations were observed in ETH-resistant MDR-TB isolates at the following rates: 100% in katG, 72% in ethA, 45.6% in mshA, 8.7% in ndh, and 33.3% in inhA or its promoter. Of the three ETH-susceptible MDR-TB isolates, all showed mutations in katG; one had a mutation in ethA, and another, in mshA and inhA. Finally, of the four fully susceptible isolates, two showed no detectable mutation in the studied genes, and two had mutations in mshA gene unrelated to the resistance. Mutations not previously reported were found in the ethA, mshA, katG, and ndh genes. The concordance between the phenotypic susceptibility testing to INH and ETH and the sequencing was 1 and 0.45, respectively. Among isolates exhibiting INH resistance, the high frequency of independent resistance and cross-resistance with ETH in the M. tuberculosis isolates suggests the need to confirm the susceptibility to ETH before considering it in the treatment of patients with MDR-TB.

10.1371_journal.pmed.1001932	Association between Regimen Composition and Treatment Response in Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis: A Prospective Cohort Study	Background For treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB), the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a regimen of at least four second-line drugs that are likely to be effective as well as pyrazinamide. WHO guidelines indicate only marginal benefit for regimens based directly on drug susceptibility testing (DST) results. Recent evidence from isolated cohorts suggests that regimens containing more drugs may be beneficial, and that DST results are predictive of regimen effectiveness. The objective of our study was to gain insight into how regimen design affects treatment response by analyzing the association between time to sputum culture conversion and both the number of potentially effective drugs included in a regimen and the DST results of the drugs in the regimen. Methods and Findings We analyzed data from the Preserving Effective Tuberculosis Treatment Study (PETTS), a prospective observational study of 1,659 adults treated for MDR TB during 2005-2010 in nine countries: Estonia, Latvia, Peru, Philippines, Russian Federation, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan. For all patients, monthly sputum samples were collected, and DST was performed on baseline isolates at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We included 1,137 patients in our analysis based on their having known baseline DST results for at least fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs, and not having extensively drug-resistant TB. These patients were followed for a median of 20 mo (interquartile range 16-23 mo) after MDR TB treatment initiation. The primary outcome of interest was initial sputum culture conversion. We used Cox proportional hazards regression, stratifying by country to control for setting-associated confounders, and adjusting for the number of drugs to which patients' baseline isolates were resistant, baseline resistance pattern, previous treatment history, sputum smear result, and extent of disease on chest radiograph. In multivariable analysis, receiving an average of at least six potentially effective drugs (defined as drugs without a DST result indicating resistance) per day was associated with a 36% greater likelihood of sputum culture conversion than receiving an average of at least five but fewer than six potentially effective drugs per day (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.36, 95% CI 1.09-1.69). Inclusion of pyrazinamide (aHR 2.00, 95% CI 1.65-2.41) or more drugs to which baseline DST indicated susceptibility (aHR 1.65, 95% CI 1.48-1.84, per drug) in regimens was associated with greater increases in the likelihood of sputum culture conversion than including more drugs to which baseline DST indicated resistance (aHR 1.33, 95% CI 1.18-1.51, per drug). Including in the regimen more drugs for which DST was not performed was beneficial only if a minimum of three effective drugs was present in the regimen (aHR 1.39, 95% CI 1.09-1.76, per drug when three effective drugs present in regimen). The main limitation of this analysis is that it is based on observational data, not a randomized trial, and drug regimens varied across sites. However, PETTS was a uniquely large and rigorous observational study in terms of both the number of patients enrolled and the standardization of laboratory testing. Other limitations include the assumption of equivalent efficacy across drugs in a category, incomplete data on adherence, and the fact that the analysis considers only initial sputum culture conversion, not reversion or long-term relapse. Conclusions MDR TB regimens including more potentially effective drugs than the minimum of five currently recommended by WHO may encourage improved response to treatment in patients with MDR TB. Rapid access to high-quality DST results could facilitate the design of more effective individualized regimens. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm whether individualized regimens with more than five drugs can indeed achieve better cure rates than current recommended regimens.

10.15537_smj.2015.12.12155	Characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis at a tertiary care hospital in Peshawar, Pakistan	Objectives: To determine characteristics and treatment outcomes of multidrugs resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients and risk factors for poor outcomes in MDR-TB patients in a tertiary care hospital in Peshawar, Pakistan. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at the Programmatic Management of Drug Resistant TB Unit, Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar, Pakistan and included all MDR-TB patients registered between January 2012 and December 2012. A special proforma was used for data collection. Analysis was performed using SPSS version 16, after exporting data from the proforma. Differences in proportions were assessed using Pearson's Chi square test whereas for predictors of poor outcomes, multivariate logistic regression analysis with Wald Statistical criteria using backward elimination method was performed. Results: The treatment success rate was 74.3%. In univariate analysis, poor outcomes were associated in patients with age >= 44 years (odds ratio [OR]=0.250; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.114-0.519, p=0.001), rural residence (OR=0.417; 95% CI: 0.18-0.937, p=0.03), lung cavitation (OR=0.22; 95% CI, 0.007-0.067, p=0.001), resistance to second line drugs (SLD) (OR=3.441; 95% CI: 1.579-7.497, p=0.001), and resistance to ofloxacin (OR=2.944; 95% CI: 1.361-6.365, p=0.005); whereas multivariate logistic regression analysis, poor outcomes were associated in patients with age >= 44 years (OR= 0.249, 95% CI: 0.075-0.828, p=0.023), rural residence (OR= 0.143, 95% CI: 0.052-0.774, p=0.032), and cavitatory lungs (OR= 0.022, 95% CI: 0.007-0.072, p= 0.000). Conclusion: The MDR-TB patient needs special attention for better treatment outcomes. The presence of older age, rural area residence, resistance to ofloxacin, SLD resistance, and cavitary disease are independent prognostic factors for poor outcome in patients with MDR-TB.

10.1093_jac_dkv247	Quantifying the impact of drug combination regimens on TB treatment efficacy and multidrug resistance probability	Objectives: TB patients' non-adherence to the multidrug treatment regimen is thought to be the main cause of the emergence of drug resistance. The purpose of this study was to quantify the impacts of two-drug combination regimens and non-adherence to these regimens on treatment efficacy and drug resistance probability. Methods: A drug treatment modelling strategy was developed by incorporating a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model into a bacterial population dynamic model to explore the dynamics of TB bacilli and evolution of resistance during multidrug combination therapy, with an emphasis on non-adherence. A Hill-equation-based pharmacodynamic model was used to assess the bactericidal efficacy of single drugs and to estimate drug interactions. Results: Non-adherence to the treatment regimen increased treatment duration by nearly 1.6- and 3.4-fold relative to compliance with treatment. Symptom-based intermittent treatment, a form of non-adherence, might lead to treatment failure and accelerated growth and evolution of resistant mutants, resulting in a dramatically higher probability of 4.17 x 10(-3) (95% CI 2.10x10(-4)-1.28x10(-2)) for the emergence of MDR TB. Overall, determination of the optimal treatment regimen depended on the different types of medication adherence. Conclusions: Our model not only predicts evolutionary dynamics, but also quantifies treatment efficacy. More broadly, our model provides a quantitative framework for improving treatment protocols and establishing an emergence threshold of resistance that can be used to prevent drug resistance.

10.1128_JCM.01179_15	Improved Detection by Next-Generation Sequencing of Pyrazinamide Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates	The technical limitations of common tests used for detecting pyrazinamide (PZA) resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates pose challenges for comprehensive and accurate descriptions of drug resistance in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). In this study, a 606-bp fragment (comprising the pncA coding region plus the promoter) was sequenced using Ion Torrent next-generation sequencing (NGS) to detect associated PZA resistance mutations in 88 recultured MDR-TB isolates from an archived series collected in 2001. These 88 isolates were previously Sanger sequenced, with 55 (61%) designated as carrying the wild-type pncA gene and 33 (37%) showing mutations. PZA susceptibility of the isolates was also determined using the Bactec 460 TB system and the Wayne test. In this study, isolates were recultured and susceptibility testing was performed in Bactec 960 MGIT. Concordance between NGS and MGIT results was 93% (n = 88), and concordance values between the Bactec 460, the Wayne test, or pncA gene Sanger sequencing and NGS results were 82% (n = 88), 83% (n = 88), and 89% (n = 88), respectively. NGS confirmed the majority of pncA mutations detected by Sanger sequencing but revealed several new and mixed-strain mutations that resolved discordancy in other phenotypic results. Importantly, in 53% (18/34) of these isolates, pncA mutations were located in the 151 to 360 region and warrant further exploration. In these isolates, with their known resistance to rifampin, NGS of pncA improved PZA resistance detection sensitivity to 97% and specificity to 94% using NGS as the gold standard and helped to resolve discordant results from conventional methodologies.

10.1016_j.cmi.2015.08.023	Acquisition of second-line drug resistance and extensive drug resistance during recent transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in rural China	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is prevalent in countries with a high TB burden, like China. As little is known about the emergence and spread of second-line drug (SLD) -resistant TB, we investigate the emergence and transmission of SLD-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in rural China. In a multi-centre population-based study, we described the bacterial population structure and the transmission characteristics of SLD-resistant TB using Spoligotyping in combination with genotyping based on 24-locus MIRU-VNTR (mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable-number tandem repeat) plus four highly variable loci for the Beijing family, in four rural Chinese regions with diverse geographic and socio-demographic characteristics. Transmission networks among genotypically clustered patients were constructed using social network analysis. Of 1332 M. tuberculosis patient isolates recovered, the Beijing family represented 74.8% of all isolates and an association with MDR and simultaneous resistance between first-line drugs and SLDs. The genotyping analysis revealed that 189 isolates shared MIRU-VNTR patterns in 78 clusters with clustering rate and recent transmission rate of 14.2% and 8.3%, respectively. Fifty-three SLD-resistant isolates were observed in 31 clusters, 30 of which contained the strains with different drug susceptibility profiles and genetic mutations. In conjunction with molecular data, socio-network analysis indicated a key role of Central Township in the transmission across a highly interconnected network where SLD resistance accumulation occurred during transmission. SLD-resistant M. tuberculosis has been spreading in rural China with Beijing family being the dominant strains. Primary transmission of SLD-resistant strains in the population highlights the importance of routine drug susceptibility testing and effective anti-tuberculosis regimens for drug-resistant TB.

10.1093_trstmh_trv092	Prevalence of drug resistant TB among outpatients at an HIV/TB clinic in Lilongwe, Malawi	Background: We sought to determine the prevalence of drug resistant TB among outpatients initiating TB treatment in Lilongwe, Malawi. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of patients 18 years and older initiating TB treatment at Martin Preuss Centre, the primary integrated HIV/TB clinic in Lilongwe, Malawi, from April 2011 to July 2012. Procedures included questionnaires, physical exam, chest x-ray, full blood count and sputum collection. Sputum samples underwent acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear testing and culture by Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) and liquid Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) methods. Drug sensitivity was investigated using the Hain GenoType MTBDRplus line probe assay. Results: Of the 702 patients, 219 (31.2%) were female and 653 (93.0%) were presenting for first-time TB treatment. HIV co-infection was present in 420 (59.8%) cases, with 137 (32.6%) of those patients receiving antiretroviral therapy at presentation. TB was culture-confirmed in 375 (53.4%) patients, 349 of which were first time treatment and 26 retreatment. Ten cases of isoniazid-resistant TB (2.9% of culture confirmed cases of newly treated TB), one of rifampin-resistant TB (0.3% culture confirmed cases of newly treated TB) and one of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) (3.8% of culture confirmed cases of retreatment TB) were detected. Conclusions: MDR-TB prevalence is low among outpatients initiating TB treatment in Lilongwe.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0216	Clinical research in the treatment of tuberculosis: current status and future prospects	To supplement previous state-of-art reviews on anti-tuberculosis treatment and to pave the way forward with reference to the current status, we systematically reviewed published literature on clinical research on tuberculosis (TB) over the past decade in the treatment of drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), with a focus on drugs, dosing factors and regimens. Our review was restricted to Phase II/III clinical trials, cohort and case-control studies, and systematic reviews of clinical studies. TB programmatic and patient behavioural factors, non-TB drugs, adjunctive surgery, new vaccines, immunotherapy, antiretroviral therapy and management of latent tuberculous infection are outside the scope of this review. An algorithm was used to systematically search PubMed for relevant articles published in English from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2014. Articles without evaluated factors (drugs, dosing factors and regimens) or comparative analysis of specified anti-tuberculosis treatment outcomes were excluded. Of the 399 articles initially identified, 294 were excluded. The main findings of the remaining 105 articles are described under two categories: presumed drug-susceptible TB and MDR-TB. Fifty-nine articles included under drug-susceptible TB were divided into 12 subcategories: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, fluoroquinolones, fixed-dose combination drugs, dosing frequency, treatment phases, treatment duration, experimental regimens for pulmonary (surrogate markers vs. clinical outcomes) and extra-pulmonary TB. Forty-nine articles included under MDR-TB were divided into seven subcategories: fluoroquinolones, pyrazinamide, second-line injectable drugs, World Health Organization Group 4 and Group 5 drugs, MDR-TB regimens and novel drugs. Clinical research in the last decade and ongoing trials might furnish new paradigms for improving the treatment of this recalcitrant ancient disease.	drug-susceptible; drug-resistant; treatment outcome	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; EARLY BACTERICIDAL ACTIVITY; POSITIVE PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; INTENSIVE PHASE TREATMENT; DOSE-RANGING TRIAL; SPUTUM CULTURE CONVERSION; SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; PLASMA-CONCENTRATIONS
10.5588_ijtld.15.0341	Patients' costs associated with seeking and accessing treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa	SETTING: South Africa is one of the world's 22 high tuberculosis (TB) burden countries, with the second highest number of notified rifampicin-resistant TB (R-R-TB) and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases. OBJECTIVE: To estimate patient costs associated with the diagnosis and treatment of R-R-TB/MDR-TB in South Africa. DESIGN: Patients diagnosed with RR-TB/MDR-TB and accessing care at government health care facilities were surveyed using a structured questionnaire. Direct and indirect costs associated with accessing R-R-TB/MDR-TB care were estimated at different treatment durations for each patient. RESULTS: A total of 134 patients were surveyed: 84 in the intensive phase and 50 in the continuation phase of treatment, 82 in-patients and 52 out-patients. The mean monthly patient costs associated with the diagnosis and treatment of R-R-TB/MDR-TB were higher during the intensive phase than the continuation phase (US$235 vs. US$188) and among in-patients than among outpatients (US$269 vs. US$122). Patients in the continuation phase and those accessing care as out-patients reported higher out-of-pocket costs than other patients. Most patients did not access social protection for costs associated with RR-TB/MDR-TB illness. CONCLUSION: Despite free health care, patients bear high costs when accessing diagnosis and treatment services for R-R-TB/MDR-TB; appropriate social protection mechanisms should be provided to assist them in coping with these costs.	treatment duration; out-of-pocket expenditure; poverty	DIAGNOSIS
10.5588_ijtld.15.0327	Nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) was ascertained by 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) and spoligotyping at four hospitals in the Republic of Moldova, a high MDR-TB burden country. Overall, 5.1% of patients with pan-susceptible TB at baseline were identified with MDR-TB during in-patient treatment. In 75% of cases, the MDR-TB strain was genetically distinct from the non-MDR-TB strain at baseline, suggesting a high rate of nosocomial transmission of MDR-TB. The highest proportion (40.3%) of follow-up MDR-TB isolates was associated with the M. tuberculosis URAL 163-15 strain.	infection control; MDR-TB; nosocomial transmission; URAL 163-15	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PROPOSAL; MOLDOVA; RISK
10.5588_ijtld.15.0274	Beyond multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Europe: a TBNET study	The emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is a challenge to TB control in Europe. We evaluated second-line drug susceptibility testing in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from patients with multidrug-resistant, pre-extensively drug-resistant (pre-XDR-TB) and XDR-TB at 23 'TBNET sites in 16 European countries. Over 30% of bacilli from patients with pre-XDR-TB showed resistance to any fluoroquinolone and almost 70% to any second-line injectable drug. Respectively >90% and >80% of the XDR-TB strains tested showed phenotypic resistance to pyrazinamide and ethambutol. Resistance to prothionamide/ethionamide was high in bacilli from pre-XDR-TB patients (43%) and XDR-TB patients (49%).

10.5588_ijtld.14.0956	Systematic screening for drug-resistant tuberculosis with Xpert (R) MTB/RIF in a referral hospital in Cambodia	SETTING: Limited access to drug susceptibility testing (DST) in referral hospitals contributes to delayed detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). OBJECTIVE: To document the impact of identifying rifampicin (RMP) resistance using Xpert (R) MTB/RIF on time to diagnosis and time to treatment, and evaluate its performance under programmatic conditions. METHODS: Using a prospective observational study, we screened presumptive MDR-TB cases with Xpert and solid culture/conventional DST. RMP resistance was confirmed using a line-probe assay (LPA). We recorded diagnostic and treatment delays. We performed rpoB gene sequencing post hoc to resolve discordant RMP susceptibilities. RESULTS: We screened 299 of 345 presumptive MDR-TB individuals, and identified 44 Xpert RMP-resistant cases: 16/165 (10%) were new and 28/136 (20%) retreated. The median time to diagnosis was 2 days (Xpert) vs. an additional 6 with LPA; the median time to treatment was 14 days. Confirmatory LPA on 39/44 revealed 27 concordant, 6 discordant and 6 invalid results. Xpert RMP resistance was confirmed in respectively 24/30 (80%) and 21/23 (91%) by phenotypic DST and rpoB sequencing. CONCLUSION: Screening presumptive MDR-TB patients with Xpert enabled rapid diagnosis and treatment of MDR-TB. Xpert performed well, provided appropriate risk assessment was done. Rapid confirmatory testing added little to clinical decision making. Our findings support the latest World Health Organization guidelines to abandon confirmatory LPA in favour of repeat Xpert when in clinical doubt, pending phenotypic DST.	rapid drug susceptibility testing; rifampicin resistance; positive predictive value	POSITIVE RIFAMPICIN RESISTANCE; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DIAGNOSIS; ASSAY; PERFORMANCE; MUTATIONS; CULTURE
10.5588_ijtld.14.0847	Rapid detection of rifampicin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis by high-resolution melting curve analysis	SETTING: High-resolution melting curve analysis (HRMA) can be used to screen for mutations in genes without the need for specific probes, with low turnaround time and high cost-effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To detect the sensitivity and specificity of a line-probe assay (LPA) and HRMA in comparison with BACTEC (TM) MGIT (TM) 960 for the detection of rifampicin (RMP) resistance. DESIGN: A total of 219 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates tested by MGIT 960 for RMP susceptibility were tested with HRMA and LPA. Discordant samples were processed for sequencing of the RMP resistance-determining region (RRDR) of the rpoB gene. RESULTS: HRMA identified 93 of 103 (90.3%) isolates that were resistant and 113/116 (97.4%) that were susceptible on MGIT 960, with a sensitivity and specificity of respectively 90.3% and 97.4%. HRMA identified 117/119 (98.3%) LPA-susceptible and 94/100 (94%) resistant isolates, with 98.3% specificity and 94% sensitivity. Two isolates that were susceptible on LPA but resistant on HRMA showed silent mutations at 539 and 541 codons on sequencing, while 6 isolates that were susceptible on HRMA but resistant on LPA showed D516V (n = 4) and H526C/D (n = 2) mutations. Four isolates (3.9%) that were resistant on MGIT were susceptible on all three genotypic methods, which could be due to mutations outside the RRDR or efflux pumps. CONCLUSION: HRMA shows good potential as a rapid screening tool for the detection of drug resistance.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0136	The thin-layer agar method for direct phenotypic detection of multi- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis	BACKGROUND: Molecular techniques rapidly detect resistance to rifampicin (RMP) and isoniazid (INH), but do not eliminate the need for culture-based drug susceptibility testing (DST) against other drugs. The thin-layer agar (TLA) test, a non-commercial direct DST method, has demonstrated good performance for INH and RMP; however, evidence is still limited, and its applicability for DST of ofloxacin (OFX) and kanamycin (KM) is unknown. DESIGN: We compared 279 TLA DST results with those of MGIT for INH and RMP, and 280 results for OFX and KM with those of the 7H11 agar proportion method, obtained from 320 smear-positive samples from 165 Georgian TB patients. Discrepancies were solved by comparison with a composite reference standard. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) was 30 of 164 patients (18.3%), 2 (6.7%) of whom had extensively drug-resistant TB. RESULTS: TLA showed 94.7%, 98.2%, 100% and 78.9% sensitivity, respectively, for INH, RMP, OFX and KM, with 100% specificity. Average time to results was 7 days in TLA, 23 in MGIT and 49 for 7H11 agar. CONCLUSIONS: In low-resource settings, TLA can be applied for the rapid detection of resistance to INH, RMP and fluoroquinolones. Further studies are necessary to improve sensitivity to ICM and further assess its performance for OFX and other drugs and its applicability in field conditions.	resistance detection; non-commercial method; tuberculosis; MDR-TB; XDR-TB	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; INEXPENSIVE METHOD; SMEAR MICROSCOPY; ASSAY; CULTURE; RIFAMPICIN; DIAGNOSIS
10.1016_j.tube.2015.07.003	Determination of in vitro synergy between linezolid and other antimicrobial agents against Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates	In this study, our objective was to explore the potential in vitro synergy between linezolid (LZD) and six other anti-TB drugs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, especially multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains. Among the different combinations, the LZD-clarithromycin (CLA) combination showed the best synergism, which was observed in 85% (34/40) of 40 isolates. In addition, one (2.5%) and twentyone (52.5%) of 40 isolates showed synergism for the LZD-levofloxcin (LEV) and LZD-moxifloxacin (MOX) combinations, respectively, and the difference in the proportion of synergy between these two combinations was significantly different (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the percentage of drug synergy against non-MDR group seemed higher than that against MDR group in each combination, while the significant difference was only observed in the LZD-EMB combination (P = 0.046). In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that LZD shows the synergistic activity against both non-MDR and MDR M. tuberculosis strains when in combination with CLA, EMB, MOX, amikacin and clofazimine, indicating that LZD may be considered as a promising component involving the regimen for the treatment of MDR-TB.

10.1038_srep17507	Within patient microevolution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis correlates with heterogeneous responses to treatment	Genetic heterogeneity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) within a patient has caused great concern as it might complicate antibiotic treatment and cause treatment failure. But the extent of genetic heterogeneity has not been described in detail nor has its association with heterogeneous treatment response. During treatment of a subject with MDR-TB, serial computed tomography (CT) scans showed this subject had six anatomically discrete lesions and they responded to treatment with disparate kinetics, suggesting heterogeneous MTB population may exist. To investigate this heterogeneity, we applied deep whole genome sequencing of serial sputum isolates and discovered that the MTB population within this patient contained three dominant sub-clones differing by 10 similar to 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Differential mutation patterns in known resistance alleles indicated these sub-clones had different drug-resistance patterns, which may explain the heterogeneous treatment responses between lesions. Our results showed clear evidence of branched microevolution of MTB in vivo, which led to a diverse bacterial community. These findings indicated that complex sub-populations of MTB might coexist within patient and contribute to lesions' disparate responses to antibiotic treatment.

10.1016_j.ejmech.2015.10.008	Structure activity relationships of 4-hydroxy-2-pyridones: A novel class of antituberculosis agents	Pyridone 1 was identified from a high-throughput cell-based phenotypic screen against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) including multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) as a novel anti-TB agent and subsequently optimized series using cell-based Mtb assay. Preliminary structure activity relationship on the isobutyl group with higher cycloalkyl groups at 6-position of pyridone ring has enabled us to significant improvement of potency against Mtb. The lead compound 30j, a dimethylcyclohexyl group on the 6-position of the pyridone, displayed desirable in vitro potency against both drug sensitive and multi-drug resistant TB clinical isolates. In addition, 30j displayed favorable oral pharmacokinetic properties and demonstrated in vivo efficacy in mouse model. These results emphasize the importance of 4-hydroxy-2-pyridones as a new chemotype and further optimization of properties to treat MDR-TB. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

10.1136_thoraxjnl_2015_207374	Achieving high treatment success for multidrug-resistant TB in Africa: initiation and scale-up of MDR TB care in Ethiopia-an observational cohort study	Background In Africa, fewer than half of patients receiving therapy for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) are successfully treated, with poor outcomes reported for HIV-coinfected patients. Methods A standardised second-line drug (SLD) regimen was used in a non-governmental organisation-Ministry of Health (NGO-MOH) collaborative community and hospital-based programme in Ethiopia that included intensive side effect monitoring, adherence strategies and nutritional supplementation. Clinical outcomes for patients with at least 24 months of follow-up were reviewed and predictors of treatment failure or death were evaluated by Cox proportional hazards models. Results From February 2009 to December 2014, 1044 patients were initiated on SLD. 612 patients with confirmed or presumed MDR TB had >= 24 months of follow-up, 551 (90.0%) were confirmed and 61 (10.0%) were suspected MDR TB cases. 603 (98.5%) had prior TB treatment, 133 (21.7%) were HIV coinfected and median body mass index (BMI) was 16.6. Composite treatment success was 78.6% with 396 (64.7%) cured, 85 (13.9%) who completed treatment, 10 (1.6%) who failed, 85 (13.9%) who died and 36 (5.9%) who were lost to follow-up. HIV coinfection (adjusted HR (AHR): 2.60, p<0.001), BMI (AHR 0.88/kg/m(2), p=0.006) and cor pulmonale (AHR 3.61, p=0.003)and confirmed MDR TB (AHR 0.50, p=0.026) were predictive of treatment failure or death. Conclusions We report from Ethiopia the highest MDR TB treatment success outcomes so far achieved in Africa, in a setting with severe resource constraints and patients with advanced disease. Intensive treatment of adverse effects, nutritional supplementation, adherence interventions and NGO-MOH collaboration were key strategies contributing to success. We argue these approaches should be routinely incorporated into programmes.

10.1007_s00284_015_0891_x	MDR-TB Antibody Response (Western Blot) to Fractions of Isoniazid and Rifampicin Resistant Antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Drug-resistant TB poses a major threat to control of TB worldwide. Despite progress in the detection of Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases, a major diagnostic gap remains: 55 % of reported TB patients estimated to have MDR-TB were not detected in 2013. MDR-TB antigens were conjugated to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. Specific polyclonal antibodies against MDR-TB Ags were prepared in rabbits using two boosted injections of the MDR-TB antigen. The antibodies were purified and treated with susceptible TB to remove any non-specific and cross-reactive antibodies. In the present study, comparative analysis of electrophoretic pattern of different antigens of INH/RIF-resistant TB were studied for identifying protein profiles. A RIF-resistant TB antigen was shown here to have different protein profiles from INH-resistant TB isolate. The results of Western blotting analysis showed that in the RIF- and INH-resistant antigenic fractions some bands of 14.4 and 45 kDa as immunogenic were common. Moreover, four bands of RIF-resistant TB antigen fractions (16, 19, 21, and 45 KDa) and one band of INH-resistant TB (about 26 KDa) were detected as diagnostic antigens. This study suggests that the Western blot is an accurate test to survey INH- and RIF-resistant TB antigens of M. tuberculosis infection. These findings indicate that MDR-TB diagnosis (based on Ag detection) could be useful in the identification of disease stages that precede symptomatic and microbiologically positive TB, such as subclinical and incipient TB.

pub-0492	Identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Rifampin Resistance in Clinical Specimens Using the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay	Purpose. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a novel real-time polymerase chain reaction technique for the detection of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) complex and rifampin (RIF) resistance. We evaluated the performance of this assay in identifying MTB and resistance to RIF in clinical specimens. Materials and Methods. We analyzed clinical specimens from 383 patients with suspected TB who were hospitalized at a secondary hospital in Korea. Specimens were processed using the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, acid-fast bacilli smear and culture, and drug susceptibility test (DST). Results. Among the 444 clinical samples analyzed, the Xpert MTB/RIF assay identified MTB in 56 (13.8%) of 405 respiratory specimens, but did not detect MTB in the remaining 39 non-respiratory specimens. Of the 65 pulmonary TB patients, 52 (80.0%) were confirmed by using mycobacterial culture as a reference standard. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay were 73.85%, 99.03%, 94.12%, and 94.72%, respectively. Among five patients with RIF resistance determined by the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, four (80%) were confirmed as suffering from multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB by DST. Conclusions. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay appears to be an accurate, simple, and useful technique for detecting MTB, especially in respiratory specimens. However, RIF resistance, if detected, should be verified with DST.	pulmonary tuberculosis; real-time polymerase chain reaction; rifampin	EXTRAPULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; DIAGNOSIS; METAANALYSIS
10.1186_s12879_015_1253_9	Health system delay in treatment of multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients in Bangladesh	Background: Bangladesh is one of the 27 high burden countries for multidrug resistant tuberculosis listed by the World Health Organization. Delay in multidrug resistant tuberculosis treatment may allow progression of the disease and affect the attempts to curb transmission of drug resistant tuberculosis. The main objective of this study was to investigate the health system delay in multidrug resistant tuberculosis treatment in Bangladesh and to explore the factors related to the delay. Methods: Information related to the delay was collected as part of a previously conducted case-control study. The current study restricts analysis to patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis who were diagnosed using rapid diagnostic methods (Xpert MTB/RIF or the line probe assay). Information was collected by face-to-face interviews and through record reviews from all three Government hospitals providing multidrug resistant tuberculosis services, from September 2012 to April 2013. Multivariable regression analysis was performed using Bootstrap variance estimators. Definitions were as follows: Provider delay: time between visiting a provider for first consultation on MDR-TB related symptom to visiting a designated diagnostic centre for testing; Diagnostic delay: time from date of diagnostic sample provided to date of result; Treatment initiation delay: time between the date of diagnosis and date of treatment initiation; Health system delay: time between visiting a provider to start of treatment. Health system delay was derived by adding provider delay, diagnostic delay and treatment initiation delay. Results: The 207 multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients experienced a health system delay of median 7.1 weeks. The health system delay consists of provider delay (median 4 weeks), diagnostic delay (median 5 days) and treatment initiation delay (median 10 days). Health system delay (Coefficient: 37.7; 95 %; CI 15.0-60.4; p 0.003) was associated with the visit to private practitioners for first consultation. Conclusions: Diagnosis time for multidrug resistant tuberculosis was fast using the rapid tests. However, some degree of delay was present in treatment initiation, after diagnosis. The most effective way to reduce health system delay would be through strategies such as engaging private practitioners in multidrug resistant tuberculosis control.

10.1371_journal.pone.0142425	Drug Susceptibility Patterns in MDR-TB Patients: Challenges for Future Regimen Design. A Cross-Sectional Study	Globally, there is substantial concern regarding the challenges of treating complex drug resistance patterns in multidrug resistant tuberculosis cases. Utilising data from three different settings (Estonia, Latvia, Romania) we sought to contrast drug susceptibility profiles for multidrug resistant tuberculosis cases, highlight the difficulties in designing universal regimen, and inform future regimen selection. Demographic and microbiological surveillance data for multidrug resistant tuberculosis cases from 2004-13 were analysed. High levels of additional resistance to currently recommended second line drugs were seen in all settings, with extensive variability between countries. Accurate drug susceptibility testing and drug susceptibility testing data are vital to inform the development of comprehensive, flexible, multidrug resistant tuberculosis guidance.

10.1371_journal.pone.0142873	Time to ART Initiation among Patients Treated for Rifampicin-Resistant Tuberculosis in Khayelitsha, South Africa: Impact on Mortality and Treatment Success	Setting Khayelitsha, South Africa, with high burdens of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) and HIV co-infection. Objective To describe time to antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation among HIV-infected RR-TB patients initiating RR-TB treatment and to assess the association between time to ART initiation and treatment outcomes. Design A retrospective cohort study of patients with RR-TB and HIV co-infection not on ART at RR-TB treatment initiation. Results Of the 696 RR-TB and HIV-infected patients initiated on RR-TB treatment between 2009 and 2013, 303 (44%) were not on ART when RR-TB treatment was initiated. The median CD4 cell count was 126 cells/mm(3). Overall 257 (85%) patients started ART during RR-TB treatment, 33 (11%) within 2 weeks, 152 (50%) between 2-8 weeks and 72 (24%) after 8 weeks. Of the 46 (15%) who never started ART, 10 (21%) died or stopped RR-TB treatment within 4 weeks and 16 (37%) had at least 4 months of RR-TB treatment. Treatment success and mortality during treatment did not vary by time to ART initiation: treatment success was 41%, 43%, and 50% among patients who started ART within 2 weeks, between 2-8 weeks, and after 8 weeks (p = 0.62), while mortality was 21%, 13% and 15% respectively (p = 0.57). Mortality was associated with never receiving ART (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 6.0, CI 2.1-18.1), CD4 count <= 100 (aHR 2.1, CI 1.0-4.5), and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) with second-line resistance (aHR 2.5, CI 1.1-5.4). Conclusions Despite wide variation in time to ART initiation among RR-TB patients, no differences in mortality or treatment success were observed. However, a significant proportion of patients did not initiate ART despite receiving >4 months of RR-TB treatment. Programmatic priorities should focus on ensuring all patients with RR-TB/HIV co-infection initiate ART regardless of CD4 count, with special attention for patients with CD4 counts <= 100 to initiate ART as soon as possible after RR-TB treatment initiation.

10.1099_jmm.0.000164	Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in sputum specimens using a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay in Korea	Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), remains one of the leading causes of death in the world. In Korea, the current prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) poses a major problem. The most common method for diagnosing TB in developing countries is sputum smear microscopy; however, the sensitivity of this test is relatively low and it usually requires well-trained laboratory staff. Cultures of MTC require up to several weeks in sophisticated facilities, such as Biosafety Level 3. Effective diagnostic techniques are necessary to control TB. In Korea, we evaluated a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay targeting the hspX gene (TB-hspX-LAMP) of MTC. For clinical evaluation, culture confirmation, smear microscopy and TB-hspX-LAMP were performed on 303 sputum specimens obtained from suspected TB patients in Korea. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of TB-hspX-LAMP were 71.1, 98.8, 91.4 and 95.1 %, respectively, compared with TB culture, which is the gold standard for diagnosis of TB. In contrast, the comparable values of smear microscopy were 24.4, 98.1, 68.8 and 88.2 %, respectively. Therefore, we concluded that TB-hspX-LAMP was superior to the use of smear microscopy for the detection of MTC in sputum specimens in clinical settings in Korea.

10.1093_jac_dkv215	Outcomes of pulmonary MDR-TB: impacts of fluoroquinolone resistance and linezolid treatment	Objectives: Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are the most important second-line drugs for MDR-TB treatment. Therapeutic options for FQ-resistant (FQ-R) MDR/XDR-TB are very limited. The purpose of the present study was to determine treatment outcomes and risk factors associated with unfavourable outcomes of MDR/XDR-TB, focusing on the impacts of FQ-R status and linezolid treatment. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of 337 MDR-TB patients, including 144 (42.7%) FQ-R MDR/XDR-TB cases. Treatment outcomes were evaluated according to WHO 2013 recommendations. Results: Later-generation FQs such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin were given to 331 (98.2%) patients. Overall, favourable outcomes were achieved in 272 (80.7%) patients. FQ-R second-line injectable drug-susceptible MDR [adjusted OR (aOR) 4.299, 95% CI 1.239-14.916, P = 0.015] and XDR status (aOR 6.294, 95% CI 1.204-32.909, P = 0.024) were independently associated with unfavourable outcomes. However, FQ-susceptible (FQ-S) secondl-ine injectable drug-resistant MDR status was not associated with unfavourable outcomes (aOR 1.814, 95% CI 0.314-10.485, P = 0.999). Favourable treatment outcomes were more frequent in FQ-R MDR/XDR-TB patients who received linezolid (82.8%) compared with those who did not receive linezolid (58.1%, P = 0.002). When FQ-R MDR/XDR-TB treatment without linezolid was used as a reference, the addition of linezolid was associated with favourable outcomes (aOR 4.081, 95% CI 1.237-13.460, P = 0.017), comparable to those for FQ-S MDR-TB (aOR 4.341, 95% CI 1.470-12.822, P = 0.005). Conclusions: Later-generation FQs could improve treatment outcomes of patients with MDR-TB. Linezolid should be considered for inclusion in FQ-R MDR/XDR-TB treatment regimens.

10.4103_0971_5916.171284	Drug resistance among extrapulmonary TB patients: Six years experience from a supranational reference laboratory	Background & objectives: There is limited information available about the drug resistance patterns in extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB), especially from high burden countries. This may be due to difficulty in obtaining extrapulmonary specimens and limited facilities for drug susceptibility testing. This study was undertaken to review and report the first and second-line anti-TB drug susceptibility patterns in extrapulmonary specimens received at the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT), Chennai, India, between 2005 and 2012. Methods: Extrapulmonary specimens received from referring hospitals were decontaminated and cultured using standard procedures. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was done by absolute concentration or resistance ratio methods for the first and the second line anti-TB drugs. Results: Between 2005 and 2012, of the 1295 extrapulmonary specimens, 189 grew M. tuberculosis, 37 (19%) cases were multidrug resistant (MDR) while one was extensively drug resistant (XDR). Specimenwise MDR prevalence was found to be: CSF-10 per cent, urine-6 per cent, fluids and aspirates-27 per cent, pus-23 per cent, lymph nodes-19 per cent. Resistance to isoniazid and ethionamide was found to be high (31 and 38%, respectively). Interpretation & conclusions: Drug resistance including MDR-TB was observed in a significant proportion of extrapulmonary specimens referred for DST. Access to culture and DST for extrapulmonary specimens should be expanded. Guidelines for MDR-TB management should have explicit sections on extra-pulmonary tuberculosis and training on laboratory techniques is urgently required.

10.4103_0971_5916.171285	Multidrug-resistant pulmonary & extrapulmonary tuberculosis: A 13 years retrospective hospital-based analysis	Background & objectives: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a public health problem of great significance in India. In the present study an attempt was made to analyse the progression of MDR-TB pattern during a course of 13 years (2000-2012) among the patient population at a tertiary care centre in New Delhi, India. Methods: Mycobacterial isolates obtained on Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) medium/BacT/ALERT 3D were identified using AccuProbe molecular identification system, routine biochemical tests or GenoType Mycobacteria CM. Antimycobacterial susceptibility testing was performed using resistance ratio method on L-J medium (2000-2004) and one per cent proportion method on BacT/ALERT 3D system (2005-2012). Results: Of the total 14,849 samples subjected to mycobacterial culture, 6569 pulmonary and 8280 extrapulmonary, 2364 were detected positive for mycobacteria. The average percentage positivity rate was 15.9 per cent (18.9 and 13.6% in case of pulmonary and extrapulmonary samples, respectively). Our study revealed a significant increase (P<0.001) in multidrug resistance by 12 per cent (4.7% in 2000 to 19.8% in 2012). MDR-TB was more in case of pulmonary (28.2%) than extrapulmonary (11.6%) TB (P<0.001). Only 6.5 per cent (154) of mycobacterial isolates were non-tuberculous mycobacteria and rapid growers represented by Mycobacterium fortuitum and M. abscessus were the most commonly isolated species. Interpretation & conclusions: Increase in prevalence of MDR-TB by 12 per cent in the past 13 years is alarming. Policy modifications may have to be done to strengthen the existing TB control programmes to encourage contact tracing and culture and drug susceptibility testing for all smear positive pulmonary cases to ensure early and appropriate therapy.

10.1016_j.rmed.2015.07.006	The Xpert (R) MTB/RIF assay in routine diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis: A multicentre study in Lithuania	Introduction: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is an important public health problem in Lithuania with MDR rates in new cases reaching 11% in 2012. Currently available diagnostic tools are not fully adequate for an accurate and rapid result for diagnosis of TB and MDR-TB. Objectives: To evaluate the performance of Xpert (R) MTB/RIF assay for an early diagnosis of TB and detection of rifampicin (RIF) resistance in routine settings in Lithuania. Methods: A total of 833 individual respiratory samples obtained from patients previously treated for TB and MDR-TB contacts were tested using the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Performance characteristics of the assay for TB and RIF resistance detection were calculated using culture and phenotypical DST results as a gold standard. Results: The overall sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for TB detection were 93.7% and 91.7%, respectively with the sensitivity for smear-negative specimens reaching 82.5%. Resistance to RIF was detected in 81 (20.7%) primary specimens with no false negative results; there were 4/225 (1.8%) false-positives among strains sensitive to rifampicin. Overall sensitivity and specificity of the molecular assay for detection of RIF resistance calculated against phenotypic DST results were 100% and 98.2%, respectively. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate very good performance of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the detection of TB and RIF resistance on primary respiratory specimens. It provides strong evidence that implementation of the assay for routine laboratory diagnosis in high drug-resistance settings may improve and facilitate TB diagnosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

10.1136_thoraxjnl_2015_207245	A systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of N-acetylcysteine in preventing aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity: implications for the treatment of multidrug-resistant TB	Background Ototoxicity is a severe side effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Aminoglycosides are recommended for the treatment of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) appears to protect against drug-and noise-induced hearing loss. This review aimed to determine if coadministering NAC with aminoglycoside affected ototoxicity development, and to assess the safety and tolerability of prolonged NAC administration. Methods Eligible studies reported on the efficacy of concomitant NAC and aminoglycoside administration for ototoxicity prevention or long-term (>= 6 weeks) administration of NAC regardless of indication. Pooled estimates were calculated using a fixed-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I-2 statistic. Results Three studies reported that NAC reduced ototoxicity in 146 patients with end-stage renal failure receiving aminoglycosides. Pooled relative risk for otoprotection at 4-6 weeks was 0.14 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.45), and the risk difference was -33.3% (95% CI 45.5% to 21.2%). Eighty-three studies (N=9988) described the administration of NAC for >6 weeks. Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea and arthralgia were increased 1.4-2.2 times. Discussion This review provides evidence for the safety and otoprotective effect of NAC when coadministered with aminoglycoside. It represents a strong justification for a clinical trial to investigate the effect of concomitant NAC treatment in patients receiving aminoglycosides as part of MDR-TB treatment.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0328	Assessing the effect of decentralisation of laboratory diagnosis for drug-resistant tuberculosis in Kenya	SETTING: Drug susceptibility testing (DST) is recommended in Kenya to identify multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in persons registered for tuberculosis (TB) retreatment. DST is performed at a central laboratory with a two-step growth-based process and a regional laboratory with a simultaneous molecular- and growth-based process. OBJECTIVE: To compare proportions of retreatment cases who underwent DST and turnaround times for hospitals referring to the central vs. regional laboratory. DESIGN: Cases were persons registered for TB retreatment from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2013. Records of 11 hospitals and 7 hospitals referring patients to the regional and central laboratories, respectively, were reviewed. RESULTS: Respectively 238/432 (55%) and 88/355 (25%) cases from hospitals referring to the regional and central laboratories underwent DST. The mean time from case registration to receipt of DST results and initiation of MDR-TB treatment was quicker in hospitals referring to the regional laboratory. The time required for the transportation of specimens, specimen testing and receipt of DST results at hospitals was shorter for the regional laboratory (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Testing was faster and more complete at hospitals referring to the regional laboratory. A comprehensive review of MDR-TB detection in Kenya is required to increase the proportion of cases receiving DST.	decentralisation; laboratory testing; drug-resistant tuberculosis	
10.5588_ijtld.15.0361	Spatiotemporal evidence for cross-border spread of MDR-TB along the Trans-Siberian Railway line	BACKGROUND: Mongolia has the fifth highest incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in the Western Pacific Region, with high rates of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). OBJECTIVE: To examine the recent spatiotemporal dynamics of MDR-TB in Mongolia. METHODS: All MDR-TB cases diagnosed from 2004 to 2012, identified from the National Tuberculosis Control Programme database, were included in the study. Cases diagnosed from 2006 to 2012 were further examined using spatial scan statistics. RESULTS: Few MDR-TB cases (n = 29) were diagnosed before the programmatic management of MDR-TB was introduced in 2006. During 2006-2012, 1106 MDR-TB cases were detected, at an annualised rate of 5.9 cases per 100 000 population. Most (>80%) cases were identified in the 15-44 year age group; 45% were among those aged 15-29 years. Case notification rates were highest in the capital city, Ulaanbaatar, with an increasing trend over time in all locations. Three MDR-TB hotspots were identified, all in close proximity to the Trans-Siberian Railway line. The majority of the MDR-TB isolates were resistant to all first-line drugs tested. CONCLUSION: Spatiotemporal analysis indicates likely cross-border spread of MDR-TB along the Trans-Siberian Railway line, with subsequent spatial expansion across Mongolia. The frequency of MDR-TB among young patients with pan-resistance to all first-line drugs suggests ongoing MDR-TB transmission within the community.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; epidemiology; spatiotemporal analysis; high-incidence setting	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; RISK-FACTORS; MONGOLIA; TRANSMISSION; PREVALENCE; CHINA; CARE
10.1016_j.apjtm.2015.10.014	Anti TB drug resistance in Tanga, Tanzania: a cross sectional facility base prevalence among pulmonary TB patients	Objective: To determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with drug resistance tuberculosis (TB) at facility-base level in Tanga, Tanzania. Methods: A total of 79 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates included in the study were collected from among 372 (312 new and 60 previously treated) TB suspects self referred to four TB clinics during a prospective study conducted from November 2012 to January 2013. Culture and drug susceptibility test of the isolates was performed at the institute of medical microbiology and epidemiology of infectious diseases, University hospital, Leipzig, Germany. Data on the patient's characteristics were obtained from structured questionnaire administered to the patients who gave informed verbal consent. Unadjusted bivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the risk factors for drug resistant-TB. The significance level was determined at P<0.05. Results: The overall proportions of any drug resistance and MDR-TB were 12.7% and 6.3% respectively. The prevalence of any drug resistance and MDR-TB among new cases were 11.4% and 4.3% respectively, whereas among previously treated cases was 22.2% respectively. Previously treated patients were more likely to develop anti-TB drug resistance. There was no association between anti-TB drug resistances (including MDR-TB) with the risk factors analysed. Conclusions: High proportions of anti TB drug resistance among new and previously treated cases observed in this study suggest that, additional efforts still need to be done in identifying individual cases at facility base level for improved TB control programmes and drug resistance survey should continuously be monitored in the country.

10.1016_j.jiph.2015.05.003	Molecular analysis of rpoB gene mutations in rifampicin resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates by multiple allele specific polymerase chain reaction in Puducherry, South India	Background: rpoB gene mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) make the bacteria resistant to rifampicin. Thus, these mutations are surrogate markers for multi-drug resistance (MDR). The objective of this study was to evaluate an allele-specific multiplex-polymerase chain reaction (MAS-PCR) assay to detect mutations at codons 516, 526 and 531 of the rpoB gene. Methods: In total, 127 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates were subjected to standard drug susceptibility tests. A MAS-PCR assay was then performed to detect mutations in the rpoB gene. Three different allele-specific PCR assays were performed (single-step MAS-PCR) and the amplified products were sequenced. Results: Of the 127 isolates, 69 (54.3%) were nnultidrug resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB), 21(16.5%) were rifampicin mono-resistant and 37 (29.1%) were drug susceptible. The frequency of mutations at codons 531, 526 and 516 was 54.4%, 18.9% and 5.6%, respectively. A triple mutation was found in 4 (4.4%) isolates. Mutations in regions other than the 81-bp region were observed at codons 413 (11.1%), 511 (12.2%) and 521 (15.6%) of the rpoB gene. Conclusions: The simplicity and specificity of the MAS-PCR assay allows for easy implementation in clinical laboratories to detect rifampicin drug resistance in MDR-TB strains.

10.1016_j.diagmicrobio.2015.07.008	Comparison and development of pyrazinamide susceptibility testing methods for tuberculosis in Thailand	Pyrazinamide (PZA) plays a critical role in shortening tuberculosis treatment duration and in treating multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The standard phenotypic MGIT PZA susceptibility testing method is imperfect because it is slow and has potential for false resistance. In this study, we evaluated 2 different phenotypic-based methods, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) phage assay, and MTT assay, as well as genotypic sequencing. The assay was evaluated on 71 clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates (37 MGIT PZA susceptible and 34 MGIT PZA resistant) and compared to the MGIT result. Of these methods, the qPCR phage assay yielded an accuracy of 89% versus standard MGIT while MIT yielded 83%. The genotypic sequencing method yielded 90% accuracy. We conclude that any of these faster PZA susceptibility methods perform reasonably well against a MGIT PZA susceptibility standard. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

10.3945_ajcn.115.113886	High-dose vitamin D-3 in adults with pulmonary tuberculosis: a double-blind randomized controlled trial	Background: Tuberculosis, including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), is a major global health problem. Individuals with tuberculosis disease commonly exhibit vitamin D deficiency, which may adversely affect immunity and the response to therapy. Objective: We determined whether adjunctive high-dose vitamin D-3 supplementation improves outcomes in individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis disease. Design: The study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, intent-to-treat trial in 199 individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis disease in Tbilisi, Georgia. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive oral vitamin D-3 [50,000 IUs (1.25 mg) thrice weekly for 8 wk and 50,000 IU every other week for 8 wk] or a placebo concomitant with standard first-line antituberculosis drugs. The primary outcome was the time for the conversion of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) sputum culture to negative. Results: Baseline characteristics between groups were similar. Most subjects (74%) were vitamin D deficient (plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration <50 nmol/L). With vitamin D-3, plasma 25(OH)D concentrations peaked at similar to 250 nmol/L by 8 wk and decreased to similar to 125 nmol/L at week 16. Adverse events and plasma calcium concentrations were similar between groups. In 192 subjects with culture-confirmed tuberculosis, an adjusted efficacy analysis showed similar median culture-conversion times between vitamin D-3 and placebo groups [29 and 27 d, respectively; HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.18; P = 0.33). Eight-week culture-conversion rates were also similar (84.0% and 82.1% for vitamin D-3 and placebo, respectively; P = 0.99). Conclusion: A high-dose vitamin D-3 regimen safely corrected vitamin D deficiency but did not improve the rate of sputum Mtb clearance over 16 wk in this pulmonary tuberculosis cohort.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; randomized controlled trial; tuberculosis; vitamin D	EXTENSIVELY DRUG-RESISTANT; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; GEORGIA; POPULATION; IMMUNITY
10.1111_tmi.12581	The Second Zambian National Tuberculosis Drug Resistance survey - a comparison of conventional and molecular methods	ObjectiveThe prevalence of MDR-TB in Zambia was estimated to be 1.8% in 2001. A second drug resistance survey was conducted in 2008 to determine trends; the use of the Genotype MTBDRplus assay was applied to compare results to the gold standard. MethodA two-stage cluster sampling, with health facilities as primary sampling units. Processed sputum specimens were inoculated on solid media for culture; heat-inactivated bacterial suspensions from sputum samples were tested on a commercial line probe assay for the identification of rifampicin and isoniazid resistance. ResultsA total of 917 patients with TB were enrolled and 883 (96.3%) analysed. A total of 574 (65%) had LJ results and 824 (93.3%) had results from MTBDRplus assay. The median age was 32, and 63.3% were males. MDR-TB according to LJ-based DST was 1.1% (CI 0.1-2.4) whereas according to MDTBDRplus assay was 1.6% (CI 0.6-2.6). Isoniazid monoresistance in new cases was 2.4% (CI 0.613-4.26) based on LJ results and 5.0% (CI 3.2-6.7) based on the MTBDRplus; in retreatment cases, it was 4.4% (CI 0.3-8.6) and 2.40% (CI <0.1-5.1) on LJ and MTBDRplus, respectively. Rifampicin monoresistance in new cases was 0.1% (CI <0.1-0.4) based on LJ and 0.6% (CI 0.01-1.1) based on the MTBDRplus; in retreatment cases, it was 0% (CI 0-3.8) and 1.8% (CI <0.1-4.0) on LJ and MTBDRplus, respectively. There were no XDR-TB cases found and no association between MDR-TB and HIV. ConclusionThere was no increase in MDR-TB prevalence in Zambia from 2001 to 2008; results from the two methods were similar. Molecular methods were quicker and simpler to use.

10.1111_tmi.12566	Diagnostic and treatment delays of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis before initiating treatment: a cross-sectional study	ObjectiveShandong Province has implemented the standardised treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) supported by the Global Fund. The study aimed to understand the managements and delays of patients with MDR-TB before initiating their treatments. MethodsAll patients with MDR-TB who had completed intensive phase treatment from January 2010 to May 2012 were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Delays and treatments were analysed. Diagnosis delay is defined as the period between having sputum smear results and drug susceptibility test (DST) results. Treatment delay was defined as starting MDR-TB treatment more than 2days after receiving the diagnosis of MDR-TB. Total delay is the sum of diagnosis delay and treatment delay. ResultsIn total, 110 patients with MDR-TB participated in the study. Median delay for diagnosis was 102days. Over 80% of patients had a diagnosis delay longer than 90days. MDR-TB treatments commenced after a median of 9days after DST results, and over 37% of the patients with MDR-TB experienced treatment delays. Chronic cases or patients with indifferent attitude had significantly longer treatment delay than other groups (P=0.03 and 0.03, respectively). During their delays, of 44 patients with retreatment failures, 12 (27.3%) were treated through adding single second line drugs (SLDs) to first-line regimens, and 25 (56.8%) were treated with first-line drugs. A high proportion of initial treatment failure/relapsed/returned cases (37%) and new cases (43%) were administered with SLDs. ConclusionsMost of the patients with MDR-TB experienced prolonged diagnosis delay, which was the most important factor contributing to the total delay. Misuse of SLDs during the days was common, so necessary training should be given to prevent irrational prescription of medications.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; treatment delay; diagnosis delay; second-line drugs; China	DRUG-RESISTANT; MDR-TB; CHINA; PREVALENCE; TRANSMISSION; SHANGHAI
10.1186_s12879_015_1214_3	Treatment outcomes in multidrug resistant tuberculosis-human immunodeficiency virus Co-infected patients on anti-retroviral therapy at Sizwe Tropical Disease Hospital Johannesburg, South Africa	Background: Multidrug resistant-tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a threat to global tuberculosis control which is worsened by human immune-deficiency virus (HIV) co-infection. There is however paucity of data on the effects of antiretroviral treatment (ART) before or after starting MDR-TB treatment. This study determined predictors of mortality and treatment failure among HIV co-infected MDR-TB patients on ART. Methods: A retrospective medical record review of 1200 HIV co-infected MDR-TB patients admitted at Sizwe Tropical Disease Hospital, Johannesburg from 2007 to 2010 was performed. Chi-square test was used to determine treatment outcomes in HIV co-infected MDR-TB patients on ART. Multivariable logistic regression and Poisson models were used to determine predictors of mortality and treatment failure respectively. Results: Mortality was higher (21.8 % vs. 15.4 %) among patients who started ART before initiating MDR-TB treatment compared with patients initiated on ART after commencing MDR-TB treatment (p = 0.013). Factors significantly associated with mortality included: the use of ART before starting MDR-TB treatment (OR 1.65, 95 % CI 1.02-2.73), severely-underweight (OR 3.71, 95 % CI 1.89-7.29) and underweight (OR 2.35, 95 % CI 1.30-4.26), cavities on chest x-rays at baseline (OR 1.76, 95 % CI 1.08-2.94), presence of other opportunistic infections (OR 1.80, 95 % CI 1.10-2.94) and presence of other co-morbidities (OR 2.26, 95 % CI 1.20-4.21). Factors predicting failure were severe anaemia (IRR (OR 4.72, 95 % CI 1.47-15), other co-morbidities (OR 2.39, 95 % CI 1.05-5.43) and modified individualised regimen at baseline (OR 2.15, 95 % CI 0.98-4.71). Conclusions: High mortality among patients already on ART before initiating MDR-TB treatment is a worrisome development. Management of adverse-events, opportunistic infections and co-morbidities in these patients is important if the protective benefits of being on ART are to be maximized. There is the need to intensify intervention programmes targeted at early identification of MDR-TB, treatment initiation, drug monitoring and increasing adherence among HIV co-infected MDR-TB patients.

10.1186_s12913_015_1145_0	Pathways to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment initiation: a qualitative comparison of patients' experiences in the era of rapid molecular diagnostic tests	Background: Although new molecular diagnostic tests such as GenoType MTBDRplus and Xpert (R) MTB/RIF have reduced multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment initiation times, patients' experiences of diagnosis and treatment initiation are not known. This study aimed to explore and compare MDR-TB patients' experiences of their diagnostic and treatment initiation pathway in GenoType MTBDRplus and Xpert (R) MTB/RIF-based diagnostic algorithms. Methods: The study was undertaken in Cape Town, South Africa where primary health-care services provided free TB diagnosis and treatment. A smear, culture and GenoType MTBDRplus diagnostic algorithm was used in 2010, with Xpert (R) MTB/RIF phased in from 2011-2013. Participants diagnosed in each algorithm at four facilities were purposively sampled, stratifying by age, gender and MDR-TB risk profiles. We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews using a semi-structured interview guide. Through constant comparative analysis we induced common and divergent themes related to symptom recognition, health-care access, testing for MDR-TB and treatment initiation within and between groups. Data were triangulated with clinical information and health visit data from a structured questionnaire. Results: We identified both enablers and barriers to early MDR-TB diagnosis and treatment. Half the patients had previously been treated for TB; most recognised recurring symptoms and reported early health-seeking. Those who attributed symptoms to other causes delayed health-seeking. Perceptions of poor public sector services were prevalent and may have contributed both to deferred health-seeking and to patient's use of the private sector, contributing to delays. However, once on treatment, most patients expressed satisfaction with public sector care. Two patients in the Xpert (R) MTB/RIF-based algorithm exemplified its potential to reduce delays, commencing MDR-TB treatment within a week of their first health contact. However, most patients in both algorithms experienced substantial delays. Avoidable health system delays resulted from providers not testing for TB at initial health contact, non-adherence to testing algorithms, results not being available and failure to promptly recall patients with positive results. Conclusion: Whilst the introduction of rapid tests such as Xpert (R) MTB/RIF can expedite MDR-TB diagnosis and treatment initiation, the full benefits are unlikely to be realised without reducing delays in health-seeking and addressing the structural barriers present in the health-care system.

10.1186_s12879_015_1202_7	Multidrug resistant tuberculosis: prevalence and risk factors in districts of metema and west armachiho, Northwest Ethiopia	Background: Multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is an emerging challenge for TB control programs globally. According to World health organization, 2012 report Ethiopia stands 15th out of the 27 high priority countries in the world and 3rd in Africa. Updated knowledge of the magnitude of MDR-TB is so substantial to allocate resources, and to address prevention and control measures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of MDR-TB and associated risk factors in West Armachiho and Metema districts of North Gondar. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in West Armachiho and Metema districts between February 01 and June 25, 2014. A total of 124 consecutive smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients were included in the study. Socio-demographic and possible risk factor data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Drug susceptibility testing was first performed for rifampicin using GeneXpert MTB/RIF. For those rifampicin resistant strains, drug susceptibility testing was performed for both isoniazid and rifampicin to identify MDR-TB using the proportional method on LJ media. Data were analyzed using statistical Package SPSS version 20; binary logistic regression was used to assess the association. P-values < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Results: Of 124 smear-positive pulmonary TB patients, 117 (94.4 %) were susceptible to Rifampicin, while 7 (5.7 %) were confirmed to be resistant to Rifampicin and Isoniazid. The overall prevalence of MDR-TB was 5.7 % (2.3 % among new cases and 13.9 % among previously treated cases). History of previous treatment (OR = 7, P = 0.025) was significantly associated risk factor for MDR-TB. Conclusion: The overall prevalence of MDR-TB was 5.7 % among cases at five health centers and a history of previous treatment was found to be a risk factor for being infected by an MDR-TB strain. Therefore, maximizing early case detection and treatment, strengthening TB infection control activities and proper implementation of DOTS are recommended to reduce the burden of MDR-TB.

10.1186_s12866_015_0566_6	Xpert MTB/RIF assay for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in sputum specimens in remote health care facility	Background: Xpert MTB/RIF assay is considered as a great advance over conventional smear and culture in the diagnosis of TB and MDR-TB by simultaneously detecting M. tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance bacilli. However, very little information regarding the performance characteristics of Xpert MTB/RIF assay is available in Ethiopia. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of Xpert MTB/RIF assay compared to conventional sputum smear and culture methods for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in remote health care facility. Methods: A paired expectorated sputum samples were obtained from 227 consecutively recruited patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis at Karamara hospital during December 2013 to May 2014. One of the sputum specimen was tested directly by Ziehl-Neelsen staining and Xpert MTB/RIF assay without NALC-NaOH decontamination. The other of pair of sputa specimen was cultured for isolation of TB bacilli by conventional methods. Diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF assay and AFB smear microscopy were calculated against culture as the gold standard. Results: Overall 25.5 % (58/227) samples were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) by MGIT and/or LJ media of which 36.2 % (21/58) and 65.5 % (35/58) were positive by AFB smear microscopy and Xpert MTB/RIF respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, as well as the positive and negative predictive value of Xpert MTB/ RIF assay were 65.5 % (95 % CI: 53.3-77.7 %), 96.3 % (95 % CI: 93.4-99.2 %), 86.4 % (95 % CI: 76.2-96.5 %), and 88.6 % (95 % CI: 83.9-93.3 %) respectively. Eighteen of 58 (31 %) cases that were smear microscopy negative, were positive by Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Conclusions: Although Xpert MTB/RIF assay demonstrated high sensitivity in detecting MTBC in sputum specimens compared with conventional AFB smear microscopy, it demonstrated suboptimal sensitivity in smear negative patients compared to conventional culture.

10.1016_j.bmcl.2015.08.046	Development of a three component complex to increase isoniazid efficacy against isoniazid resistant and nonresistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis	The bacterium responsible for causing tuberculosis has evolved resistance to antibiotics used to treat the disease, resulting in new multidrug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant M. tuberculosis (XDR-TB) strains. Analytical techniques H-1 and C-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Fourier Transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance with Electrospray Ionization (FT-ICR/ESI), and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) were used to study different aspects of the Cu(II)-polyethylene glycol (PEG-3350)-sucrose-isoniazid and Cu(II)-polyethylene glycol (PEG3350)-glucose-isoniazid complexes. The Cu(II) cation, sucrose or glucose, and the aggregate formed by PEG primarily serve as a composite drug delivery agent for the frontline antibiotic, however the improvement in MIC values produced with the CU-PEG-SUC-INH complex suggest an additional effect. Several Cu-PEG-SUC-INH complex variations were tested against INH resistant and nonresistant strains of M. tuberculosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.1371_journal.pone.0139986	Risk Factors for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis among Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis at the Central Chest Institute of Thailand	There are limited data available on the risk factors for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Therefore, we here conducted a retrospective matched case-control study among adults with pulmonary TB who received treatment at the Central Chest Institute of Thailand (CCIT) between January 2007 and December 2013, in order to determine the risk factors associated with MDR-TB among patients with pulmonary TB. We identified 145 patients with pulmonary MDR-TB (cases) and 145 patients with drug-sensitive pulmonary TB (controls). Multivariate analysis identified the independent risk factors for MDR-TB as follows: (1) >= 2 episodes of prior pulmonary TB (odds ratio [OR] 39.72, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 7.86-200.66), (2) duration of illness > 60 days (OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.52-6.22), (3) sputum acid fast bacilli smear 3+ (OR 13.09, 95% CI 4.64-36.91), (4) presence of lung cavities (OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.89-7.73), and (5) presence of pleural effusion (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.06-7.16). Prior pulmonary TB management with a non-category I regimen (P = 0.012) and having treatment failure or default as treatment outcomes (P = 0.036) were observed in a higher proportion among patients with MDR-TB. Particular characteristics of lung cavities, including the maximum diameter >= 30 mm (P < 0.001), the number of cavities >= 3 (P = 0.001), bilateral involvement (P < 0.001), and >= 2 lung zones involved (P = 0.001) were more commonly observed in patients with MDR-TB. In conclusion, these clinical factors and chest radiographic findings associated with MDR-TB among patients with pulmonary TB may help physicians to provide proper management of cases for prevention of the development and spread of MDR-TB in future.

10.1186_s12889_015_2327_8	Comparison of characteristics and mortality in multidrug resistant (MDR) and non-MDR tuberculosis patients in China	Background: We conducted a cohort study to compare the characteristics of MDR-TB with non-MDR-TB patients and to measure long term (9-year) mortality rate and determine factors associated with death in China. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 250 TB cases from a 2001 survey to compare 100 MDR-TB patients with 150 non-MDR-TB patients who were treated in 2001-2002. Baseline attributes extracted from the records were compared between the two cohorts and long-term mortality and risk factors were determined at nine-year followup in 2010. Results: Among the 234 patients successfully followed up, 63 (26.9%) were female and 171 (73.1 %) were male. MDR-TB patients had poorer socioeconomic status compared to non-MDRTB. Nine years after the diagnosis of TB, 69 or 29.5 % of the 234 patients had died (32 or 21.6 % of non-MDR-TB versus 37 or 43.0 % of MDR-TB) and the overall mortality rate was 39/1000 per year (PY) (27/1000 PY among non-MDR versus 63/1000 PY among MDR-TB). Factors associated with death included: MDR status (hazard ratio (HR): 1.86; CI: 1.09-3.13), limited education of primary school or lower (HR: 2.51; CI 1.34-4.70) and received TB treatment during the nine-year period (HR 1.82; 95 % CI 1.02-3.26). Conclusions: MDR-TB was a strong predictor for poor long-term outcome. High quality diagnosis and treatment must be ensured. Greater reimbursement or free treatment may be needed to provide access for the poor and vulnerable populations, and to increase treatment compliance.		RISK-FACTORS; TRANSMISSION; PROVINCE
10.1128_AAC.01404_15	Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Ofloxacin in Children with Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Ofloxacin is widely used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Data on its pharmacokinetics and safety in children are limited. It is not known whether the current internationally recommended pediatric dosage of 15 to 20 mg/kg of body weight achieves exposures reached in adults with tuberculosis after a standard 800-mg dose (adult median area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h [AUC0-24], 103 mu g.h/ml). We assessed the pharmacokinetics and safety of ofloxacin in children <15 years old routinely receiving ofloxacin for MDR-TB treatment or preventive therapy. Plasma samples were collected predose and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and either 6 or 11 h after a 20-mg/kg dose. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis. Children with MDR-TB disease underwent long-term safety monitoring. Of 85 children (median age, 3.4 years), 11 (13%) were HIV infected, and of 79 children with evaluable data, 14 (18%) were underweight. The ofloxacin mean (range) maximum concentration (C-max), AUC0-8, and half-life were 8.97 mu g/ml (2.47 to 14.4), 44.2 mu g.h/ml (12.1 to 75.8), and 3.49 h (1.89 to 6.95), respectively. The mean AUC0-24, estimated in 72 participants, was 66.7 mu g.h/ml (range, 18.8 to 120.7). In multivariable analysis, AUC(0-24) was increased by 1.46 mu g.h/ml for each 1-kg increase in body weight (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 2.47; P = 0.006); no other assessed variable contributed to the model. No grade 3 or 4 events at least possibly attributed to ofloxacin were observed. Ofloxacin was safe and well tolerated in children with MDR-TB, but exposures were well below reported adult values, suggesting that dosage modification may be required to optimize MDR-TB treatment regimens in children.

10.1128_AAC.00764_15	Epidemiologic Correlates of Pyrazinamide-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in New York City	Pyrazinamide (PZA) has important sterilizing activity in tuberculosis (TB) chemotherapy. We describe trends, risk factors, and molecular epidemiology associated with PZA-resistant (PZAr) Mycobacterium tuberculosis in New York City (NYC). From 2001 to 2008, all incident culture-positive TB cases reported by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) were genotyped by IS6110-based restriction fragment length polymorphism and spoligotype. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates underwent DNA sequencing of resistance-determining regions of pncA, rpoB, katG, and fabG1. Demographic and clinical information were extracted from the NYC DOHMH TB registry. During this period, PZAr doubled (1.6% to 3.6%) overall, accounting for 44% (70/159) of the MDR population and 1.4% (75/5511) of the non-MDR population. Molecular genotyping revealed strong microbial phylogenetic associations with PZA(r). Clustered isolates and those from acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear-positive cases had 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.71 to 4.36) and 2.0 (95% CI = 1.19 to 3.43) times higher odds of being PZAr, respectively, indicating a strong likelihood of recent transmission. Among the MDR population, PZAr was acquired somewhat more frequently via primary transmission than by independent pathways. Our molecular analysis also revealed that several historic M. tuberculosis strains responsible for MDR TB outbreaks in the early 1990s were continuing to circulate in NYC. We conclude that the increasing incidence of PZAr, with clear microbial risk factors, underscores the importance of routine PZA drug susceptibility testing and M. tuberculosis genotyping for the identification, control, and prevention of increasingly resistant organisms.

10.3855_jidc.6162	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and risk factors associated with its development: a retrospective study	Introduction: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has emerged as a major clinical public health threat and challenges the national TB control program in Malaysia. Data that elaborates on the risk factors associated with the development of MDR-TB is highly limited in this country. This study was aimed to determine the risk factors associated with the development of MDR-TB patients in peninsular Malaysia. Methodology: This was a case control study; the data were collected from medical records of all the registered MDR-TB patients at five referral TB hospitals in peninsular Malaysia from January 2010 to April 2014. The 105 cases were all confirmed by a positive sputum culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis for MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB. As a comparison, a total of 209 non-MDR-TB cases were randomly selected as controls. Results: A total of 105 MDR-TB and 209 non MDR-TB patients were studied. The risk factors associated with MDR-TB within the multivariate analysis were previous tuberculosis treatment, HIV infection, being an immigrant, and high load of positive for acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear. Conclusions: The findings of this study revealed that patients who had received previous treatment for tuberculosis, were infected with HIV, were immigrants, and had a high burden of positive testing for AFB smear were more likely to have MDR-TB. An enhanced understanding of the risk factors associated with MDR-TB strains is imperative in the development of a national policy for public health interventions.	risk factors; tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis; Malaysia	HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS; UNITED-STATES; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; PATTERNS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PREDICTORS; SITUATION; GERMANY; TB
10.1016_j.ijid.2015.08.013	Multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and associated risk factors in Oromia Region of Ethiopia	Objective: The aim of this study was to determine risk factors for tuberculosis (TB) caused by multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Oromia Region, Ethiopia. Methods: A 6-month case-control study was performed in 2013-14. Sputum samples and standardized questionnaire data (demographics, treatment, TB contact history, underlying disease, history of imprisonment) were collected from cases with suspected MDR-TB aged >= 18 years. Sputum was processed locally in the Oromia Public Health Laboratory using standard techniques. Data from MDR-TB cases and TB-positive controls were compared using logistic regression analysis. For each factor, the association with outcome variables was estimated by calculating the odds ratio (OR) together with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Results: Of 439 suspected MDR-TB cases, 265 had a confirmed M. tuberculosis infection, of whom 88 (33%) had laboratory-confirmed MDR-TB. Over two-thirds (65%) were between 18 and 39 years of age. On multivariate analysis, an occupation of farming, known TB contact history, alcohol use, HIV infection, previous known TB history, and previous TB treatment outcome were predictors of MDR-TB. Conclusions: The rate of MDR-TB was high among suspected cases in the Oromia Region of Ethiopia. Local MDR-TB detection capacity and local epidemiology studies are essential to detect MDR-TB and guide the use of the sparse resources to optimize MDR-TB control. If TB is suspected, the presence of any of the above factors should alert Oromia Region clinicians and public health professionals to screen for MDR-TB. (C) 2015 The Authors.

10.4103_0255_0857.167336	Detecting mutation pattern of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in Himachal Pradesh using GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay	Context: Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem in India and a principal cause of death in adults, especially among the economically productive age group. India accounts for one-fifth of the global burden of TB. It is estimated that about 40% of Indian population is infected with TB bacillus. The GenoType (R) MTBDRplus molecular method allows rapid diagnosis of the clinical samples and detection of the most common mutations in the genes associated with rifampicin (R) and isoniazid (H) resistance. Aims: To study the drug resistance and mutational patterns in multidrug-resistant (MDR) suspects clinical strains using GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay. Subjects and Methods: A total of 770 sputum samples of the MDR-TB suspects were included in this study, which were received at Intermediate Reference Laboratory, Government TB Sanatorium, Dharampur, Solan, Himachal Pradesh from the Designated Microscopy Centres of Himachal Pradesh for the culture and susceptibility testing. All the 521 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains were subjected to GenoType (R) MTBDRplus (HAIN Lifescience) assay to detect molecular resistance pattern to first line anti-tubercular drugs (isoniazid and rifampicin). Results: Of 770 samples, 556 (72.20%) were from male and 214 (27.80%) were from female. Among the 521 MTBC strains, 19.76% were found to be MDR and mono-resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin was detected in 8.63% and 6.14% strains respectively. About 74.81%, 76.35% and 5.40% strains harboured known mutation in rpoB, katG and inhA genes respectively. Conclusions: In rpoB gene, the most common mutation is associated with S531 L region. The GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay is a rapid test for the detection of the most common mutations in MDR-TB strains. In our study, unknown rpoB gene mutations were found in 25.18% strains that may further be detected by gene sequencing.

10.1016_j.bbapap.2015.05.003	Development of ssDNA aptamers as potent inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis acetohydroxyacid synthase	Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a promising potential drug target for an emerging class of new anti-tuberculosis agents. In this study, we identify short (30-mer) single-stranded DNA aptamers as a novel class of potent inhibitors of Mtb-AHAS through an in vitro DNA-SELEX method. Among all tested aptamers, two candidate aptamers (Mtb-Apt1 and Mtb-Apt6) demonstrated the greatest inhibitory potential against Mtb-AHAS activity with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range (28.94 +/- 0.002 and 2235 +/- 0.001 nM respectively). Interestingly, inhibition kinetics analysis of these aptamers showed different modes of enzyme inhibition (competitive and mixed type of inhibition respectively). Secondary structure-guided mutational modification analysis of Mtb-Apt1 and Mtb-Apt6 identified the minimal region responsible for their inhibitory action and consequently led to 17-mer and 20-mer shortened aptamers that retained equivalent or greater inhibitory potential. Notably, a modeling and docking exercise investigated the binding site of these two potent inhibitory aptamers on the target protein and showed possible involvement of some key catalytic dimer interface residues of AHAS in the DNA-protein interactions that lead to its potent inhibition. Importantly, these two short candidate aptamers, Mtb-Apt1 (17-mer) and Mtb-Apt6 (20-mer), also demonstrated significant growth inhibition against multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR-TB) strains of tuberculosis with very low MIC of 536 mu g/ml and 6.24 mu g/ml, respectively and no significant cytotoxicity against mammalian cell line. This is the first report of functional inhibitory aptamers against Mtb-AHAS and provides the basis for development of these aptamers as novel and strong anti-tuberculosis agents.

10.1016_j.diagmicrobio.2015.06.020	Identification of mutations conferring streptomycin resistance in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis of China	We investigated the spectrum and frequency of mutations in rpsL, rrs, and gidB among 140 multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) clinical isolates from China. The association between mutations and different genotypes was also analyzed. Our data revealed that 65.7% of MDR-TB were resistant to streptomycin (STR), and 90.2% of STR-resistant isolates were Beijing strains. STR resistance was correlated with Beijing family (P = 0.00). Compared with phenotypic data, detection of mutations for the combination of these 3 genes exhibited 94.6% sensitivity, 91.7% specificity, and 93.6% accuracy. The most common mutations in SIR-resistant isolates were rpsL128, 262, and rrs514, of which rpsL128 showed association with Beijing lineage (P = 0.00). A combination of these 3 mutations can serve as the reliable predictors for SIR resistance, showing the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 85.9%, 97.9%, and 90.0%, respectively. Furthermore, gidBA276C, not A615G, was Beijing lineage specific. These findings are useful to develop rapid molecular diagnostic methods for SIR resistance in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

10.5588_ijtld.14.0826	Outcomes of Category II anti-tuberculosis treatment in Indian children	SETTING: The emerging threat of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has cast doubt on the efficacy of Category II anti-tuberculosis treatment in retreatment cases. Data on outcomes of treatment with the Category II regimen in children are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To study outcomes of Category II anti-tuberculosis treatment in Indian children. DESIGN: Charts belonging to patients registered between 2004 and 2012 at the Paediatric Tuberculosis Clinic, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India, were reviewed, and children receiving Category II anti-tuberculosis treatment were included in the study. Outcomes were recorded as treatment success and poor outcome, which included treatment failure and default. RESULTS: A total of 125 children (mean age 101.6 months, standard deviation 42.9; girls 58 [46.4%]) were initiated on Category II anti-tuberculosis treatment, mainly due to worsening clinical conditions (36.8%) and relapse (36%). Treatment success, treatment failure and default were recorded in respectively 80 (64%), 20 (16%) and 25 (20%) children. Children who were non-adherent to previous treatment tended to default from Category II treatment as well (11.8% in previous non-defaulters vs. 37.5% in previous defaulters, P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Category II anti-tuberculosis treatment was effective in approximately 60% of children who had failed or defaulted from the previous regimen. All efforts should be made to isolate Mycobacterium tuberculosis and perform drug susceptibility testing to identify MDR-TB in children.	tuberculosis; children; retreatment	DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; SOUTH-AFRICA; CHILDHOOD; RISK; DOTS
10.5588_ijtld.15.0183	Evaluation of Xpert (R) MTB/RIF assay: diagnosis and treatment outcomes in rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: The Xpert (R) MTB/RIF assay is endorsed by the World Health Organization for the detection of rifampicin (RMP) resistant tuberculosis (TB). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate Xpert for its diagnostic accuracy in detecting RMP-resistant TB and its impact on treatment outcomes. DESIGN: Patients with available phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) results and those in whom RMP-resistant pulmonary TB was diagnosed using Xpert were evaluated. The accuracy and turnaround time (TAT) of Xpert for determining RMP-resistant TB was calculated. The TATs for treatment between patients diagnosed with RMP-resistant TB using Xpert and those diagnosed without the assay (phenotypic DST group) were compared. RESULTS: In 321 patients, when phenotypic DST was used as the gold standard, Xpert sensitivity and specificity for RMP resistance diagnosis was respectively 100% and 98.7%; the positive and negative predictive values were respectively 86.2% and 100%. The Xpert group had a much shorter interval from initial evaluation to commencing second-line anti-tuberculosis treatment (64 vs. 2 days, P < 0.001), and negative conversion of mycobacterial cultures (197 vs. 62.5 days, P < 0.001) than the phenotypic DST group. CONCLUSION: Xpert was accurate at diagnosing RMP resistance in this setting with an intermediate TB burden and a low level of RMP resistance. Xpert might reduce disease transmission by reducing the sputum culture conversion times for patients with RMP-resistant TB.	rapid molecular assay; pulmonary tuberculosis; MDR-TB; turnaround time	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; GENEXPERT MTB/RIF; RELIABILITY; AFRICA
10.5588_ijtld.14.0936	Predicting differential rifamycin resistance in clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates by specific rpoB mutations	SETTING: Rifampin (RMP) resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis is usually assumed to be resistant to all rifamycins. Increasing evidence indicates, however, that some rpoB mutations, detectable by rapid molecular diagnostics, confer resistance to RMP but not to rifabutin (RBT), suggesting that RBT may be effective for the treatment of M. tuberculosis with these mutations. OBJECTIVE: To determine if specific rpoB mutations reliably predict differential phenotypic resistance to RMP and RBT. DESIGN: We selected 60 clinical M. tuberculosis isolates from a repository of multinational multidrug-resistant tuberculosis isolates and stratified them into two groups: 1) those with rpoB mutations suspected to confer differential resistance to RMP and RBT, and 2) those expected to be cross-resistant to RMP and RBT. These assumptions were tested by comparing the phenotypic susceptibilities of RMP/RBT with those predicted by mutations in the rpoB gene. RESULTS: Of 20 suspected RMP-resistant/RBT-susceptible isolates, 15 were RMP-resistant but RBT-susceptible, 3 were RMP- and RBT-susceptible, and 2 were cross-resistant to both RMP and RBT. In comparison, 40 of 40 suspected cross-resistant isolates were both RMP- and RBT-resistant. CONCLUSION: Our data support the association between specific rpoB mutations and differential resistance of M. tuberculosis to RMP and RBT. Clinical studies are required to investigate the efficacy of RBT in the treatment of M. tuberculosis harboring these mutations.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0148	Enrichment of regulatory T-cells in blood of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	OBJECTIVE: To measure the percentage of regulatory T-cells (Treg) and the expression of signalling molecules in these cells from the peripheral blood of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). DESIGN: Patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis (STB), MDR-TB and healthy controls (HCs) were recruited into the study. Levels of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells from peripheral blood, and programmed death-1 (PD-1), cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and inducible costimulatory (ICOS) molecule expression in the cells were measured using flow cytometry. Suppression mediated by Treg cells was assessed in carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) based suppression assays with autologous CD4(+)CD25-T-effector (Teff) cells. RESULTS: Presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resulted in a higher proportion of Treg cells in S-TB patients than in HCs, and even higher levels in MDR-TB patients. Moreover, Treg cells in MDR-TB patients constitutively expressed high-level PD-1, CTLA-4 and ICOS. In addition, when cultured with activated CD4(+)CD25(-) Teff cells, Treg cells potently suppressed proliferation of Teff cells. CONCLUSIONS: The high level of Treg cells found in the peripheral blood of tuberculosis patients may partly explain the poor immune response against M. tuberculosis, and could be a marker of MDR-TB.

10.1007_s00216_015_8928_3	Dielectrophoretic characterization of antibiotic-treated Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex cells	Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has become a serious concern for proper treatment of patients. As a phenotypic method, dielectrophoresis can be useful but is yet to be attempted to evaluate Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex cells. This paper investigates the dielectrophoretic behavior of Mycobacterium bovis (Bacillus Calmette-Gu,rin, BCG) cells that are treated with heat or antibiotics rifampin (RIF) or isoniazid (INH). The experimental parameters are designed on the basis of our sensitivity analysis. The medium conductivity (sigma (m)) and the frequency (f) for a crossover frequency (f (xo1)) test are decided to detect the change of sigma (m)-f (xo1) in conjunction with the drug mechanism. Statistical modeling is conducted to estimate the distributions of viable and nonviable cells from the discrete measurement of f (xo1). Finally, the parameters of the electrophysiology of BCG cells, C (envelope) and sigma (cyto), are extracted through a sampling algorithm. This is the first evaluation of the dielectrophoresis (DEP) approach as a means to assess the effects of antimicrobial drugs on M. tuberculosis complex cells.

10.1007_s00438_015_1048_0	Whole genome sequence analysis of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing isolates from an outbreak in Thailand	The Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing family is often associated with multidrug resistance and large outbreaks. Conventional genotyping study of a community outbreak of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) that occurred in Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand was carried out. The study revealed that the outbreak was clonal and the strain was identified as a member of Beijing family. Although, the outbreak isolates showed identical spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number tandem repeats patterns, a discrepancy regarding ethambutol resistance was observed. In-depth characterization of the isolates through whole genome sequencing of the first and the last three isolates from our culture collection showed them to belong to principal genetic group 1, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) cluster group 2, sequence type 10. Compared with the M. tuberculosis H37Rv reference genome, 1242 SNPs were commonly found in all isolates. The genomes of these isolates were shown to be clonal and highly stable over a 5-year period and two or three unique SNPs were identified in each of the last three isolates. Genes known to be associated with drug resistance and their promoter regions, where applicable, were analyzed. The presence of low or no fitness cost mutations for drug resistance and an additional L731P SNP in the rpoB gene was observed in all isolates. These findings might account for the successful transmission of this MDR-TB strain.

10.1186_s12889_015_2338_5	Challenges in detection and treatment of multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients in Vietnam	Background: Vietnam is ranked 14th among 27 countries with high burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). In 2009, the Vietnamese government issued a policy on MDR-TB called Programmatic Management of Drug-resistant Tuberculosis (PMDT) to enhance and scale up diagnosis and treatment services for MDR-TB. Here we assess the PMDT performance in 2013 to determine the challenges to the successful identification and enrollment for treatment of MDR-TB in Vietnam. Methods: In 35 provinces implementing PMDT, we quantified the number of MDR-TB presumptive patients tested for MDR-TB by Xpert MTB/RIF and the number of MDR-TB patients started on second-line treatment. In addition, existing reports and documents related to MDR-TB policies and guidelines in Vietnam were reviewed, supplemented with focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with MDR-TB key staff members. Results: 5,668 (31.2 %) of estimated 18,165 MDR-TB presumptive cases were tested by Xpert MTB/RIF and second-line treatment was provided to 948 out of 5100 (18.7 %) of MDR-TB patients. Those tested for MDR-TB were 340/3224 (10.5 %) of TB-HIV co-infected patients and 290/2214 (13.1 %) of patients who remained sputum smear-positive after 2 and 3 months of category I TB regimen. Qualitative findings revealed the following challenges to detection and enrollment of MDR-TB in Vietnam: insufficient TB screening capacity at district hospitals where TB units were not available and poor communication and implementation of policy changes. Instructions for policy changes were not always received, and training was inconsistent between training courses. The private sector did not adequately report MDR-TB cases to the NTP. Conclusions: The proportion of MDR-TB patients diagnosed and enrolled for second-line treatment is less than 20 % of the estimated total. The low enrollment is largely due to the fact that many patients at risk are missed for MDR-TB screening. In order to detect more MDR-TB cases, Vietnam should intensify case finding of MDR-TB by a comprehensive strategy to screen for MDR-TB among new cases rather than targeting previously treated cases, in particular those with HIV co-infection and contacts of MDR-TB patients, and should engage the private sector in PMDT.

10.1016_j.bmcl.2015.07.057	Synthesis and biological evaluation of phaitanthrin congeners as anti-mycobacterial agents	Natural alkaloid, tryptanthrin (indolo[2,1-b] quinazoline-6,12-dione) and its analogues are found to exhibit potent anti-tubercular activity against MDR-TB. A novel class of indolo[2,1-b] quinazolinones have been synthesized to evaluate their anti-mycobacterial activity. Enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the key enzymes and has been validated as an effective anti-microbial target. In silico molecular docking study demonstrates that the synthesized compounds exhibit high affinity for the M. tuberculosis drug target InhA. Phaitanthrin is a natural product, which belongs to a family of tryptanthrin and exhibits structural similarity except at position 6. Phaitanthrin derivatives are prepared by modifying the keto functionality of tryptanthrin. These phaitanthrin congeners are found to display promising anti-tubercular activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

10.1371_journal.pone.0137791	Rapid Molecular Detection of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis by PCR-Nucleic Acid Lateral Flow Immunoassay	Several existing molecular tests for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are limited by complexity and cost, hindering their widespread application. The objective of this proof of concept study was to develop a simple Nucleic Acid Lateral Flow (NALF) immunoassay as a potential diagnostic alternative, to complement conventional PCR, for the rapid molecular detection of MDR-TB. The NALF device was designed using antibodies for the indirect detection of labeled PCR amplification products. Multiplex PCR was optimized to permit the simultaneous detection of the drug resistant determining mutations in the 81-bp hot spot region of the rpoB gene (rifampicin resistance), while semi-nested PCR was optimized for the S315T mutation detection in the katG gene (isoniazid resistance). The amplification process additionally targeted a conserved region of the genes as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) DNA control. The optimized conditions were validated with the H37Rv wild-type (WT) Mtb isolate and Mtb isolates with known mutations (MT) within the rpoB and katG genes. Results indicate the correct identification of WT (drug susceptible) and MT (drug resistant) Mtb isolates, with the least limit of detection (LOD) being 10(4) genomic copies per PCR reaction. NALF is a simple, rapid and low-cost device suitable for low resource settings where conventional PCR is already employed on a regular basis. Moreover, the use of antibody-based NALF to target primer-labels, without the requirement for DNA hybridization, renders the device generic, which could easily be adapted for the molecular diagnosis of other infectious and non-infectious diseases requiring nucleic acid detection.

10.1016_j.jprot.2015.07.031	Proteomic analysis of ofloxacin-mono resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates	Drug resistance particularly, multi drug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has emerged as a major problem in the chemotherapy of tuberculosis. Ofloxacin (OFX) has been used as second-line drug against MDR-TB. The principal target of the OFX is DNA gyrase encoded by gyrA and gyrB genes. Many explanations have been proposed for drug resistance to OFX but still some mechanisms are unknown. As proteins manifest most of the biological processes, these are attractive targets for developing drugs and diagnostics/therapeutics. We examined the OFX resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates by proteomic approach (2DE-MALDI-TOF-MS) and bioinformatic tools under OFX induced conditions. Our study showed fourteen proteins (Rv0685, Rv0363c, Rv2744c, Rv3803c, Rv2534c, Rv2140c, Rv1475c, Rv0440, Rv2245, Rv1436, Rv3551, Rv0148, Rv2882c and Rv0733) with increased intensities in OFX resistant and OFX induced as compared to susceptible isolates. Bioinformatic analysis of hypothetical proteins (Rv2744c, Rv2140c, Rv3551 and Rv0148) revealed the presence of conserved motifs and domains. Molecular docking showed proper interaction of OFX with residues of conserved motifs. These proteins might be involved in the OFX modulation/neutralization and act as novel resistance mechanisms as well as potential for diagnostics and drug targets against OFX resistance.

10.1371_journal.pone.0135003	High Prevalence of inhA Promoter Mutations among Patients with Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa	Background Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) remains extremely difficult to treat because there are often few remaining active medications and limited diagnostic options to detect resistance. Resistance to isoniazid is typically caused by mutations in either katG or the inhA promoter. inhA mutations confer low-level resistance to isoniazid and cross-resistance to ethionamide while katG mutations confer high-level isoniazid resistance and no cross-resistance. Line Probe Assays (LPAs) that detect mutations in katG and inhA are currently performed on all positive TB cultures in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, but the frequency of inhA mutations in drug-resistant TB patients has not been examined. Methods We sought to determine the proportion of patients who could potentially benefit from high-dose isoniazid and who may be resistant to ethionamide. We reviewed 994 LPA (Hain MTBDRplus) results at the TB reference laboratory in KwaZulu-Natal to determine the frequency of mutations in either katG or the inhA promoter. We stratified these results by drug-resistance category (i.e., MDR-TB, pre-XDR-TB, and XDR-TB) as determined by phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing. Results Among MDR-and XDR-TB isolates, the prevalence of inhA mutations without a concurrent katG mutation was 14.8% and 10.3% respectively. The prevalence of inhA mutations with OR without a katG mutation was 30.3% and 82.8%, respectively. Conclusion More than 10% of patients with MDR- and XDR-TB may benefit from high-dose isoniazid. Although ethionamide is empirically included in all MDR- and XDR-TB regimens, nearly a third of MDR-TB patients and a majority of XDR-TB patients likely have resistance to ethionamide. Laboratories performing line probe assays should report specific band patterns so that clinicians may adjust treatment regimens accordingly.

10.1128_JCM.01257_15	Diagnostic Performance of the New Version (v2.0) of GenoType MTBDRsl Assay for Detection of Resistance to Fluoroquinolones and Second-Line Injectable Drugs: a Multicenter Study	Resistance to fluoroquinolones (FLQ) and second-line injectable drugs (SLID) is steadily increasing, especially in eastern European countries, posing a serious threat to effective tuberculosis (TB) infection control and adequate patient management. The availability of rapid molecular tests for the detection of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is critical in areas with high rates of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and XDR-TB and limited conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST) capacity. We conducted a multicenter study to evaluate the performance of the new version (v2.0) of the Genotype MTBDRsl assay compared to phenotypic DST and sequencing on a panel of 228 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates and 231 smear-positive clinical specimens. The inclusion of probes for the detection of mutations in the eis promoter region in the MTBDRsl v2.0 test resulted in a higher sensitivity for detection of kanamycin resistance for both direct and indirect testing (96% and 95.4%, respectively) than that seen with the original version of the assay, whereas the test sensitivities for detection of FLQ resistance remained unchanged (93% and 83.6% for direct and indirect testing, respectively). Moreover, MTBDRsl v2.0 showed better performance characteristics than v1.0 for the detection of XDR-TB, with high specificity and sensitivities of 81.8% and 80.4% for direct and indirect testing, respectively. MTBDRsl v2.0 thus represents a reliable test for the rapid detection of resistance to second-line drugs and a useful screening tool to guide the initiation of appropriate MDR-TB treatment.

10.1101_cshperspect.a017863	Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis and Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis	The continuing spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most urgent and difficult challenges facing global TB control. Patients who are infected with strains resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin, called multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB, are practically incurable by standard first-line treatment. In 2012, there were approximately 450,000 new cases and 170,000 deaths because of MDR-TB. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB refers to MDR-TB strains that are resistant to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs. The main causes of the spread of resistant TB are weak medical systems, amplification of resistance patterns through incorrect treatment, and transmission in communities and facilities. Although patients har-boring MDR and XDR strains present a formidable challenge for treatment, cure is often possible with early identification of resistance and use of a properly designed regimen. Community-based programs can improve treatment outcomes by allowing patients to be treated in their homes and addressing socioeconomic barriers to adherence.

pub-0541	Effect of Pharmacist-Led Patient Education on Management of Depression in Drug Resistance Tuberculosis Patients using Cycloserine. A Prospective Study	Management of multi-drug Resistance Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) therapy (a prolonged therapy, i.e. for 18-24 months) is complicated owing to treatment interruption. This study aimed to describe the incidence and prevalence of depression among individuals receiving MDR-TB therapy, and to detail the management approach by assessing effect of pharmacist directed education on therapy adherence and to identify pharmaceutical issues of MDR-TB patients. A randomized controlled trial was carried out at Nishter Hospital, Multan, Pakistan during the year 2014. About 70 MDR-TB patients (n = 35 in supported group and n = 35 in non-supported group) randomly participated in current observational controlled intervention trial. Patients in non-supported group received routine medical out-door patient department (OPD) check up and patients of supported group, in addition to standard medical check-up, also received socio-economic help and educational intervention from pharmacist to increase treatment adherence by managing depression. Depression scores were rated on Beck depression inventory (BDI) scale. Patients having scores of 0-9 were labeled as normal, 10-18 for mild depression, 19-29 for moderate depression, and 30-63 for severe depression. Statistically significant difference was observed in scores of depression among patients of supported and non-supported group after ten months study. The prevalence of baseline depression in supported group patients was 8.57% mild depression, 54.29% moderate depression and 37.14% severe depression. Moderate to severe depression was observed more in elderly patients, uneducated patients and in those with low socio-economic status, in patients with previous category 11 TB, in those patients having high dose of cycloserine. Most individuals in supported group experienced improvement of depression symptoms during the course of MDR-TB therapy. After ten months, 11.43% patients had moderate depression, 45.71% patients having mild depression, and 42.86% patients having no depression symptoms. Moreover in non-supported group depression persisted at moderate to severe level. Management of depressive complications is possible without compromising MDR-TB treatment. The adherence to treatment may be improved when a pharmacist provides patient education on medication use and provide support on patient's pharmaceutical issues along with socio-economic help to maintain patient's quality of life level.	category II TB; cycloserine; depression; multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB); pharmaceutical issues; socio-economic help	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; SPECIMENS; UPDATE
10.4103_0971_5916.166599	Efficacy of moxifloxacin & econazole against multidrug resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis in murine model	Background & objectives: studies have shown the bactericidal potential of econazole and clotrimazole against Mycobacterium tuberculosis under in vitro and ex vivo conditions along with their synergism with conventional antituberculosis drugs. these molecules were also found to be effective against different multidrug resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis isolates in vitro. Hence the present study was designed to evaluate the in vivo antimycobacterial potential of moxifloxacin and econazole alone and in combination against multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in a mice model. Methods: Mice were infected with 2.5x10(7) bacilli of MDR strain of M. tuberculosis by aerosol route of infection. After four weeks of infection, chemotherapy was started orally by moxifloxacin 8.0 mg/kg body wt and econazole 3.3 mg/kg alone and in combination, as well as with four first line anti-tuberculosis drugs as a positive control. The animals were sacrificed and the lungs and spleen were excised under aspetic conditions. The tissues were homogenized with sterile normal saline, an aliquot of the homogenate was plated on Middlebrook 7H11 agar supplemented with oleate albumin dextrose catalase (OADC) and incubated at 37 degrees C for four weeks. The number of visible and individual colonies were counted. Results: The first line anti-tuberculosis drugs (RIF+INH+EMB+PZA) after eight weeks of therapy had no impact as the bacillary load in lungs and spleens remained unchanged. However, econazole, moxifloxacin alone as well as in combination significantly reduced the bacillary load in lungs as well as in spleens of MDR-TB bacilli infected mice. Interpretation & conclusions: Co-administration of the two drugs (econazole and moxifloxacin) to MDR-TB strain JAL-7782 infected mice exhibited additive effect, the efficacy of the drugs in combination being higher as compared with ECZ or MOX alone. These results were substantiated by histopathological studies. This study suggests the utility of econazole for the treatment of MDR tuberculosis and warrants further work in this direction.

10.1093_jac_dkv150	Identification of novel mutations associated with clofazimine resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Objectives: Although clofazimine has been traditionally used to treat leprosy, there is recent interest in using clofazimine for the treatment of MDR-TB and drug-susceptible TB. However, the mechanisms of resistance to clofazimine are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the molecular basis of clofazimine resistance using resistant mutants isolated in vitro. Methods: We isolated 96 mutants of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to clofazimine and performed WGS and Sanger sequencing to identify possible mutations associated with clofazimine resistance. Results: We found that 97% (93/96) of clofazimine-resistant mutants had a mutation in rv0678 encoding a transcription repressor for efflux pump MmpL5. Two mutational hot spots at nucleotide positions 193 and 466 in rv0678 accounted for 43.8% (42/96) and 11.5% (11/96) of the mutations, respectively. The previously reported A202G mutation (S68G) in rv0678 occurred less frequently, in 5 of 96 mutants. The remaining 34 mutations were scattered along the entire rv0678 gene. We discovered two new genes (rv1979c and rv2535c) associated with clofazimine resistance in mutants without rv0678 mutations. Conclusions: Mutations in rv0678 are a major mechanism of clofazimine resistance. Our findings provide useful information for the design of new molecular tests for rapid detection of clofazimine resistance. Further studies are needed to address the role of rv1979c and rv2535c in clofazimine resistance and mechanisms of action.		CROSS-RESISTANCE; PYRAZINAMIDE; BEDAQUILINE; VIRULENCE
10.1093_jac_dkv128	Genome sequencing reveals novel deletions associated with secondary resistance to pyrazinamide in MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Objectives: Detection of pyrazinamide resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates presents significant challenges in settings with no dominant clonal lineages, such as Australia. We assessed the utility of WGS versus standard PCR amplification assays for the characterization of pyrazinamide resistance in MDR-TB isolates identified in New South Wales, Australia, over an 8 year period. Methods: PCR amplicon sequencing was used to identify molecular markers associated with antibiotic resistance in pyrazinamide-resistant MDR-TB isolates recovered by the New South Wales Mycobacterium Reference Laboratory between 2007 and 2014. WGS was subsequently performed on two isolates for which pncA amplification failed. Results: WGS identified two novel genomic deletions associated with in vitro resistance to pyrazinamide in MDR-TB. One isolate also carried a second deletion involving the genes dfrA and thyA associated with resistance to para-aminosalicylic acid. Conclusions: Steadily decreasing sequencing costs are increasing the appeal of WGS as an alternative approach for detecting complex patterns of pyrazinamide resistance in MDR-TB.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; whole-genome sequencing; pyrazinamide resistance	PNCA GENE-MUTATIONS; EPIDEMIOLOGY
10.1016_j.jphotobiol.2015.04.001	The potential application of photodynamic therapy in drug-resistant tuberculosis	Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious bacterial disease that has historically created a high global health burden. Unfortunately, the emergence of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB), which includes multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), has greatly affected the treatment of TB. Anti-TB chemotherapy drugs are classified into five groups to facilitate application of effective guidelines for the treatment regimen. However, chemotherapy has a limited ability to treat DR-TB, and therefore a novel alternative treatment for DR-TB is required. In this review, we focused on photodynamic therapy (PDT) as potential treatment for DR-TB. PDT is a widely used cancer treatment that combines photosensitizers and harmless laser light to produce reactive oxygen species that selectively damage the target cells. Initially, PDT was originally developed to target pathogenic microorganisms but fell into disuse because of adverse reactions. Recently, photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy is attracting attention again as an alternative treatment for bacterial infections. In our previous study, we suggested that PDT could be a novel option to treat MDR- and XDR-TB in vitro. Despite the limited previous studies regarding PDT in TB models, fast-developing bronchoscopic technologies and clinician experience will soon facilitate the clinical application of safe and minimally invasive PDT for TB.

10.1016_j.jiph.2015.04.021	An urgent need for building technical capacity for rapid diagnosis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) among new cases: A case report from Maharashtra, India	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), the prevalence of which has increased across the globe in recent years, is a serious threat to public health. Timely diagnosis of MDR-TB, especially among new TB cases, is essential to facilitate appropriate treatment, which can prevent further emergence of drug resistance and its spread in the population. The present case report from India aims to address some operational challenges in diagnosing MDR-TB among new cases and potential measures to overcome them. It argues that even after seven years of implementing the DOTS-Plus program for controlling MDR-TB, India still lacks the technical capacity for rapid MDR-TB diagnosis. The case report underscores an urgent need to explore the use of WHO-endorsed techniques such as Xpert MTB/Rif and commercial assays such as Genotype MTBDR for rapid diagnosis of MDR-TB among new cases. Suitable applications may be found for other TB high-burden countries where MDR-TB is a major concern. (C) 2015 King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences. Published by Elsevier Limited.

10.1016_j.ijantimicag.2015.06.008	Limited sampling strategies for therapeutic drug monitoring of amikacin and kanamycin in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Amikacin and kanamycin are considered important and effective drugs in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Unfortunately, the incidence of toxicity is high and is related to elevated drug exposure. In order to achieve a balance between efficacy and toxicity, a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model may help to optimise drug exposure. Patients with MDR-TB who had received amikacin or kanamycin as part of their treatment and who had routinely received therapeutic drug monitoring were evaluated. A PPK model was developed and subsequently validated. Using this model, a limited sampling model was developed. Eleven patients receiving amikacin and nine patients receiving kanamycin were included in this study. The median observed 24-h area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-24h)) was 77.2 mg h/L [interquartile range (IQR) 64.7-96.2 mg h/L] for amikacin and 64.1 mg h/L (IQR 55.6-92.1 mg h/L) for kanamycin. The PPK model was developed and validated using n-1 cross-validation. A robust population model was developed that is suitable for predicting the AUC(0-24h) of amikacin and kanamycin. This model, in combination with the limited sampling strategy developed, can be used in daily routine to guide dosing but also to assess AUC0_24h in phase 3 studies.

10.1016_j.tube.2015.04.012	Molecular snapshot of Mycobacterium tuberculosis population in Kazakhstan: A country-wide study	Republic of Kazakhstan is among the 27 high multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) burden countries in the world. Here, we analyzed the population structure and phylogeography of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Kazakhstan and impact of the identified genotypes on spread of drug resistant strains. A total of 159 M. tuberculosis isolates from different regions of Kazakhstan were typed using 24-MIRU-VNTR and spoligotyping, and the profiles were compared to the MIRU-VNTRplus and SITVIT_WEB databases. Eight isolates with double VNTR alleles were excluded from further analysis that was performed on 151 isolates. They were assigned to 10 families, Beijing (n = 109) being the largest and dominated by a single clonal cluster 94-32 and derived profiles (n = 101). The other families were represented mainly by LAM (n = 17), Ural (n = 8), NEW-1 (n = 3) and a new cluster named KAZ-1 (n = 8). Beijing, LAM and Ural isolates were detected in all parts of the country while Iran-specific family NEW-1 was found only in southern Kazakhstan (P = 0.001). A reduced scheme of 10 most polymorphic VNTR loci provided a discrimination similar to that achieved by 15-MIRU scheme and may be recommended for rapid preliminary screening of the clinical isolates in Kazakhstan. Multi-drug resistance was significantly more prevalent among Beijing (64/109) and LAM (7/17) strains compared to strains of other families (1/25; P = 0.0006 and 0.01, respectively). High prevalence of the genetically closely related MDR strains of the Beijing genotype found in different regions of Kazakhstan highlights their crucial impact on the current TB epidemic in this country.

10.1016_j.tube.2015.05.013	Resistance to pyrazinamide in Russian Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates: pncA sequencing versus Bactec MGIT 960	Resistance to pyrazinamide (PZA) may impact clinical outcome of anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy. PZA susceptibility testing using MGIT 960 is not reliable and little information is available on the prevalence of PZA resistance in Russia. A collection of 64 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including 35 multidrug resistant and extensively drug-resistant (MDR/XDR), was analyzed for PZA resistance using MGIT 960, Wayne test, and sequencing of PZA resistance genes pncA, rpsA and panD. In addition, we analyzed 519 MDR-TB strains for susceptibility to PZA by MGIT 960. Sequencing of pncA revealed 17 of 25 (68%) MDR strains and all 10 XDR strains harboring pncA mutations. A correlation of phi = 0.81 between MGIT 960 and pncA sequencing was observed. Mutations in rpsA and panD not associated with PZA resistance as defined by MGIT 960 were identified. We found 1 PZA-resistant strain without mutations in known PZA resistance genes. Almost 73% of MDR-TB strains isolated in Moscow, Russia, were PZA-resistant by MGIT 960 testing of 519 MDR-TB clinical isolates. Further studies are needed to determine the role of rpsA and panD mutations in possible low-level PZA resistance and to identify the molecular basis of new PZA resistance in the isolate without known PZA resistance mutations.

10.5588_ijtld.15.0167	Management and treatment outcomes of MDR-TB: results from a setting with high rates of drug resistance	SETTINGS: Although Pakistan has a high burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), little is known about the management and treatment outcomes of MDR-TB patients in Pakistan. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate management and predictors of unsuccessful treatment outcomes among MDR-TB patients. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, 196 MDR-TB patients enrolled at the Programmatic Management Unit for drug-resistant TB of Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan, between 1 January 2012 and 28 February 2013 were included. Patients were followed until an outcome was recorded or 31 January 2015. RESULTS: Extensive concurrent resistance to ofloxacin (OFX) and pyrazinamide (54.6%) was observed. Among 181 patients for whom treatment outcome was available, 135 (74.6%) were cured, 1 (0.6%) completed SUMMARY treatment, 35 (19.3%) died, 8 (4.4%) failed treatment and 2 (1.1%) defaulted. In multivariatc analysis, predictors of unsuccessful treatment outcome (death, failure and default) were age >40 years (OR 3.412, P = 0.009), baseline body weight <40 kg (OR 2.966, P = 0.020), concurrent comorbidity (OR 3.785, P = 0.023), resistance to OFX (OR 2.777, P = 0.023), lung cavitations at baseline chest X-ray (OR 5.253, P < 0.001) and regimen modification due to adverse events (OR 3.492, P = 0.037). CONCLUSION: The treatment outcome results were encouraging. Patients with identifiable predictors of poor treatment outcome should receive enhanced clinical management. Early detection and management of mild adverse effects can help prevent regimen modification and may improve treatment outcomes.	comorbidity; lung cavitations; ofloxacin; pyrazinamide; regimen modification	TUBERCULOSIS TREATMENT; ADVERSE EVENTS; METAANALYSIS; PREDICTORS; REGIMENS; PROGRAM; LATVIA
10.5588_ijtld.15.0158	Cost-effectiveness of improvements in diagnosis and treatment accessibility for tuberculosis control in India	SETTING: Inaccurate diagnosis and inaccessibility of care undercut the effectiveness of high-quality anti-tuberculosis treatment and select for resistance. Rapid diagnostic systems, such as Xpert (R) MTB/RIF for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and drug susceptibility testing (DST), and programs that provide high-quality DOTS anti-tuberculosis treatment to patients in the unregulated private sector (public-private mix [PPM]), may help address these challenges, albeit at increased cost. OBJECTIVE/DESIGN: We extended a microsimulation model of TB in India calibrated to demographic, epidemiologic, and care trends to evaluate 1) replacing DST with Xpert; 2) replacing microscopy and culture with Xpert to diagnose multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and non-MDR-TB; 3) implementing nationwide PPM; and combinations of (3) with (1) or (2). RESULTS: PPM (assuming costs of $38/person) and Xpert improved health and increase costs relative to the status quo. PPM alone or with Xpert cost <1 gross domestic product/capita per quality-adjusted life-year gained relative to the next best intervention, and dominated Xpert interventions excluding PPM. CONCLUSIONS: While both PPM and Xpert are promising tools for combatting TB in India, PPM should be prioritized over Xpert, as private sector engagement is more cost-effective than Xpert alone and, if sufficient resources are available, would substantially increase the value of Xpert if both interventions are implemented together.

10.3343_alm.2015.35.5.494	Phenotypic and Genotypic Analysis of Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates in Myanmar	Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most serious health problems in Myanmar. Because TB drug resistance is associated with genetic mutation(s) relevant to responses to each drug, genotypic methods for detecting these mutations have been proposed to overcome the limitations of classic phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST). We explored the current estimates of drug-resistant TB and evaluated the usefulness of genotypic DST in Myanmar. Methods: We determined the drug susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from sputum smear-positive patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB at two main TB centers. in Myanmar during 2013 by using conventional phenotypic DST and the GenoType MTBDRplus assay (Hain Lifescience, Germany). Discrepant results were confirmed by sequencing the genes relevant to each type of resistance (rpoB.for rifampicin; katG and inhA for isoniazid). Results: Of 191 isolates, phenotypic DST showed that 27.7% (n=53) were resistant to at least one first-line drug and 20.9% (n=40) were resistant to two or more, including 18.3% (n=35) multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) strains. Monoresistant strains accounted for 6.8% (n=13) of the samples. Genotypic assay of 189 isolates showed 17.5% (n=33) MDR-TB and 5.3% (n=10) isoniazid-monoresistant strains. Genotypic susceptibility results were 99.5% (n=188) concordant and agreed almost perfectly with phenotypic DST (kappa=0.99; 95% confidence interval 0.96-1.01). Conclusions: The results highlight the burden of TB drug resistance and prove the usefulness of the genotypic DST in Myanmar.

10.4103_1119_3077.154212	Concerns about the knowledge and attitude of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among health care workers and patients in Delta State, Nigeria	Background: Inadequate knowledge and wrong perception of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) by Health Care Workers (HCWs) and patients are detrimental to tuberculosis control programs. Objective: The aim was to assess the knowledge and attitudes of HCWs and TB patients about MDR-TB in Delta State, Nigeria. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out among HCWs and TB patients in Delta State, Nigeria. Data were collected using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20. Results: Ninety-six HCWs and 114 TB patients were studied. The HCWs (mean age 43.0 10.1 years) were older than the patients (mean age 41.7 16.9 years). A higher proportion (54.2%) of HCWs had tertiary education, but only 15% of the patients had above secondary education. Eight (8.3%) HCWs and majority (60.5%) of the patients had no knowledge about of MDR-TB. Only 18.4% of patients compared to 61.5% of HCWs had good knowledge of MDR-TB. Both groups demonstrated a positive attitude toward MDR-TB. Conclusion: The knowledge of MDR-TB was poor among the TB patients studied as well as among HCWs with low educational status. MDR-TB training program for both HCWs and patients need to be re-structured to allow for greater gain in MDR-TB knowledge among both groups, which in turn may help improve compliance and treatment outcomes among patients.

10.1371_journal.pone.0135802	Patient and Provider Reported Reasons for Lost to Follow Up in MDRTB Treatment: A Qualitative Study from a Drug Resistant TB Centre in India	Introduction Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis (MDR TB) is emerging public health concern globally. Lost to follow-up (LTFU) is one of the key challenge in MDRTB treatment. In 2013, 18% of MDR TB patients were reported LTFU in India. A qualitative study was conducted to obtain better understanding of both patient and provider related factors for LTFU among MDR TB treatment. Methods Qualitative semi-structured personal interviews were conducted with 20 MDRTB patients reported as LTFU and 10 treatment providers in seven districts linked to Nagpur Drug resistant TB Centre (DRTBC) during August 2012-February 2013. Interviews were transcribed and inductive content analysis was performed to derive emergent themes. Results We found multiple factors influencing MDR TB treatment adherence. Barriers to treatment adherence included drug side effects, a perceived lack of provider support, patient financial constraints, conflicts with the timing of treatment services, alcoholism and social stigma. Conclusions Patient adherence to treatment is multi-factorial and involves individual patient factors, provider factors, and community factors. Addressing issue of LTFU during MDRTB treatment requires enhanced efforts towards resolving medical problems like adverse drug effects, developing short duration treatment regimens, reducing pill burden, motivational counselling, flexible timings for DOT services, social, family support for patients & improving awareness about disease.

10.1186_s12889_015_2128_0	Designing and implementing a socioeconomic intervention to enhance TB control: operational evidence from the CRESIPT project in Peru	Background: Cash transfers are key interventions in the World Health Organisation's post-2015 global TB policy. However, evidence guiding TB-specific cash transfer implementation is limited. We designed, implemented and refined a novel TB-specific socioeconomic intervention that included cash transfers, which aimed to support TB prevention and cure in resource-constrained shantytowns in Lima, Peru for: the Community Randomized Evaluation of a Socioeconomic Intervention to Prevent TB (CRESIPT) project. Methods: Newly-diagnosed TB patients from study-site healthposts were eligible to receive the intervention consisting of economic and social support. Economic support was provided to patient households through cash transfers on meeting the following conditions: screening for TB in household contacts and MDR TB in patients; adhering to TB treatment and chemoprophylaxis; and engaging with CRESIPT social support (household visits and community meetings). To evaluate project acceptability, quantitative and qualitative feedback was collected using a mixed-methods approach during formative activities. Formative activities included consultations, focus group discussions and questionnaires conducted with the project team, project participants, civil society and stakeholders. Results: Over 7 months, 135 randomly-selected patients and their 647 household contacts were recruited from 32 impoverished shantytown communities. Of 1299 potential cash transfers, 964 (74 %) were achieved, 259 (19 %) were not achieved, and 76 (7 %) were yet to be achieved. Of those achieved, 885/964 (92 %) were achieved optimally and 79/964 (8 %) sub-optimally. Key project successes were identified during 135 formative activities and included: strong multi-sectorial collaboration; generation of new evidence for TB-specific cash transfer; and the project being perceived as patient-centred and empowering. Challenges included: participant confidence being eroded through cash transfer delays, hidden account-charges and stigma; access to the initial bank-provider being limited; and conditions requiring participation of all TB-affected household members (e.g. community meetings) being hard to achieve. Refinements were made to improve project acceptability and future impact: the initial bank-provider was changed; conditional and unconditional cash transfers were combined; cash transfer sums were increased to a locally-appropriate, evidence-based amount; and cash transfer size varied according to patient household size to maximally reduce mitigation of TB-related costs and be more responsive to household needs. Conclusions: A novel TB-specific socioeconomic intervention including conditional cash transfers has been designed, implemented, refined and is ready for impact assessment, including by the CRESIPT project. The lessons learnt during this research will inform policy-makers and decision-makers for future implementation of related interventions.

10.1371_journal.pone.0135695	Molecular Typing of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Complex by 24-Locus Based MIRU-VNTR Typing in Conjunction with Spoligotyping to Assess Genetic Diversity of Strains Circulating in Morocco	"Background Standard 24-locus Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Unit Variable Number Tandem Repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing allows to get an improved resolution power for tracing TB transmission and predicting different strain (sub) lineages in a community. Methodology During 2010-2012, a total of 168 Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex (MTBC) isolates were collected by cluster sampling from 10 different Moroccan cities, and centralized by the National Reference Laboratory of Tuberculosis over the study period. All isolates were genotyped using spoligotyping, and a subset of 75 was genotyped using 24-locus based MIRU-VNTR typing, followed by first line drug susceptibility testing. Corresponding strain lineages were predicted using MIRU-VNTRplus database. Principal Findings Spoligotyping resulted in 137 isolates in 18 clusters (2-50 isolates per cluster: clustering rate of 81.54%) corresponding to a SIT number in the SITVIT database, while 31(18.45%) patterns were unique of which 10 were labelled as ""unknown"" according to the same database. The most prevalent spoligotype family was LAM; (n = 81 or 48.24% of isolates, dominated by SIT42, n = 49), followed by Haarlem (23.80%), T superfamily (15.47%), > Beijing (2.97%), > U clade (2.38%) and S clade (1.19%). Subsequent 24-Locus MIRU-VNTR typing identified 64 unique types and 11 isolates in 5 clusters (2 to 3isolates per cluster), substantially reducing clusters defined by spoligotyping only. The single cluster of three isolates corresponded to two previously treated MDR-TB cases and one new MDR-TB case known to be contact a same index case and belonging to a same family, albeit residing in 3 different administrative regions. MIRU-VNTR loci 4052, 802, 2996, 2163b, 3690, 1955, 424, 2531, 2401 and 960 were highly discriminative in our setting (HGDI > 0.6). Conclusions 24-locus MIRU-VNTR typing can substantially improve the resolution of large clusters initially defined by spoligotyping alone and predominating in Morocco, and could therefore be used to better study tuberculosis transmission in a population-based, multi-year sample context."

10.1371_journal.pone.0134597	Cost Resulting from Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Shortages in the United States: A Hypothetical Cohort Study	Background From 2012 through 2014, the United States experienced acute shortages and price escalations of several first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) medications. Because secondary TB drug regimens are longer and adverse events occur more frequently with them, we sought to conservatively estimate the cost, to patients and the health care system, of TB treatment and medication adverse events from alternative regimens during drug shortages. Methods We assessed the cost of treatment for TB disease in the absence of isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), or pyrazinamide (PZA), or both INH and RIF. We simulated adverse events based on published probabilities using a monthly discrete-time stochastic model. For total costs, we summed costs of medications, routine testing, and treatment of adverse events using procedural terminology codes. We report average cost ratios of TB treatment during drug shortages to standard TB treatment. Results The cost ratio of TB treatment without INH, RIF, or PZA to standard treatment was 1.7 (Range: 1.2, 2.3), 4.9 (Range: 3.2, 7.3), and 1.1 (Range: 0.7, 1.7) times higher, respectively. Without both INH and RIF, the cost ratio was 18.6 (Range: 10.0, 39.0) times higher. When the prices for INH, RIF and PZA were increased, the cost for standard treatment increased by a factor of 2.7 (Range: 1.9, 3.0). The percentage of patients experiencing at least one adverse event while taking standard therapy was 3.9% (Range: 1.3%, 11.8%). This percentage increased to 51.5%(Range: 20.1%, 83.8%) when RIF was unavailable, and increased to 82.5% (Range: 41.2%, 98.5%) when both INH and RIF were unavailable. Conclusions Our conservative model illustrates that an interruption in first-line anti-TB medications leads to appreciable additional costs and adverse events for patients. The availability of these drugs in the United States should be ensured. Models that incorporate the effectiveness of alternative regimens, delays in treatment initiation, and TB transmission can provide broader perspectives on the impact of drug shortages.

10.1371_journal.pone.0135205	Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in China	Background Relatively little is known about the specific relationship and impact from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on multidrug-resistant tuberculsosis (MDR-TB). Methods We conducted a retrospective study included patients aged >= 40 years with a confirmed pulmonary TB at three tertiary hospitals (Shandong, China) between January 2011 and October 2014. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify the relationship of MDR-TB and COPD. Results A total of 2164 patients aged >= 40 years with available results of drug susceptibility test (DST) and medical records were screened for this study: 268 patients with discharge diagnosis of COPD and 1896 patients without COPD. Overall, 14.2% of patients with COPD and 8.5% patients without COPD were MDR-TB. The rate of MDR-TB were significantly higher in patients with COPD (P<0.05). Migrant (odds ratios (OR) 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.72), previous anti-TB treatment (OR 4.58, 95% CI 1.69-12.42), cavity (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.14-4.75), and GOLD stage (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.01-2.93) were the independent predictors for MDR-TB among patients with COPD. Conclusions MDR-TB occurs more frequently in patients with underlying COPD, especially those with being migrant, previous anti-TB therapy, cavity and severe airway obstruction.

10.1186_s12889_015_2105_7	Molecular typing and drug sensitivity testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated by a community-based survey in Ethiopia	Background: The identification of circulating TB strains in the community and drug sensitivity patterns is essential for the tuberculosis control program. This study was undertaken to identify M. tuberculosis strains circulating in selected communities in Ethiopia as well as to evaluate the drug sensitivity pattern of these strains. Method: This study was a continuation of the Ethiopian National TB Prevalence Survey that was conducted between 2010 and 2011. Culture-positive isolates of M. tuberculosis from previous study were typed using region of difference (RD) 9-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and spoligotyping. Drug sensitivity testing was conducted using the indirect proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen media. Result: All 92 isolates were confirmed as M. tuberculosis by RD9-based PCR and spoligotyping of 91 of these isolates leds to the identification of 41 spoligotype patterns. Spoligotype revealed higher diversity (45 %) and among this 65.8 % (27/41) were not previously reported. The strains were grouped into 14 clusters consisting of 2-15 isolates. The dominant strains were SIT53, SIT149 and SIT37 consisting of 15, 11, and 9 isolates, respectively. Our study reveals 70 % (64/91) clustered strains and only 39.1 % (25/64) occurred within the same Kebele. Further assignment of the strains to the lineages showed that 74.7 % (68/91) belonged to Euro-American lineage, 18.6 % (17/91) to East Africa Indian lineage and the remaining 6.5 % (6/91) belonged to Indo-oceanic lineage. Valid drug susceptibility test results were available for 90 of the 92 isolates. Mono-resistance was observed in 27.7 % (25/90) and poly-resistance in 5.5 % (5/90) of the isolates. Moreover, multi-drug resistance (MDR-TB) was detected in 4.4 % of the isolates whilst the rest (60/90) were susceptible to all drugs. The highest level of mono-resistance, 26.6 % (24/90), was observed for streptomycin with majority (91.1 %) of streptomycin mono-resistant strains belonging to the Euro-American lineage. Conclusion: In this study, the strains of M. tuberculosis circulating in selected sites of Ethiopia were identified along with the drug sensitivity patterns. Thus, these findings are useful for the TB Control Program of the country.		STRAIN DIFFERENTIATION; BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS; POPULATION; COMPLEX; EPIDEMIOLOGY; RISK
10.5372_1905_7415.0904.416	Human Leukocyte Antigen-G (HLA-G) 14-bp deletion polymorphism is associated with decreased risk of pulmonary fibrosis in Indonesian Javanese patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Background: Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) is a nonclassical HLA class I antigen with immunomodulatory activity that usually inhibits immune responses. The role of the HLA-G polymorphism in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is unknown. Objectives: To analyze clinical data from Indonesian Javanese patients with MDR-TB to find an association between the HLA-G polymorphism and MDR-TB. Methods: Fifty-seven Indonesian Javanese patients with MDR-TB were enrolled and monitored from May 2012 to Jan 2014. Non-TB individuals and non-MDR-TB individuals were recruited as controls. The HLA-G polymorphism status of each patient was determined by polymerase chain reaction. Patient clinical data were analyzed against polymorphism status. The presence of an association was estimated with an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated via logistic regression. Results: Nineteen (33.3%), 30 (52.6%), and 8 (14.1%) MDR-TB patient participants carried a homozygous deletion (D/D), heterozygous deletion (I/D), and homozygous insertion (I/I) genotypes, respectively. Among control participants, D/D genotype carriers less frequently had a history of TB infection (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.179-0.981, P = 0.043). The deletion allele for MDR-TB patients was associated with a decreased likelihood of developing pulmonary fibrosis (adjusted OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.014-0.639, P = 0.016). Conclusions: D/D genotype carriers are less susceptible to TB, and MDR-TB patients with a deletion allele are less likely to develop pulmonary fibrosis.

10.1590_0074_02760150100	Molecular profiling of drug resistant isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the state of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil	Drug resistance is a global threat and one of the main contributing factors to tuberculosis (TB) outbreaks. The goal of this study was to analyse the molecular profile of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in the state of Santa Catarina in southern Brazil. Fifty-three MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates were analysed by spoligotyping and a partial region of the rpoB gene, which is associated with rifampicin resistance (RMP-R), was sequenced. Some isolates were also distinguished by their mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRU). S531L was the most prevalent mutation found within rpoB in RMP-R isolates (58.5%), followed by S531W (20.8%). Only two MDR isolates showed no mutations within rpoB. Isolates of the Latin American Mediterranean (LAM) family were the most prevalent (45.3%) found by spoligotyping, followed by Haarlem (9.4%) and T (7.5%) families. SIT106 was found in 26.4% of isolates and all SIT106 isolates typed by MIRU-12 (5 out of 14) belong to MIT251. There was a high correlation between the S531W mutation and the LAM family mainly because all SIT2263 (LAM9) isolates carry this mutation. Among isolates with the S531W mutation in rpoB MIRU demonstrates a cluster formed by four isolates (SIT2263 and MIT163) and very similar profiles were observed between eight of the nine isolates. Better characterisation of TB isolates may lead to new ways in which to control and treat TB in this region of Brazil.	tuberculosis; MDR-TB; rpoB; spoligotyping; MIRU	RPOB MUTATIONS; RIFAMPIN RESISTANCE; GENETIC DIVERSITY; RNA-POLYMERASE; STRAINS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; SUBSTITUTION; PREVALENCE; DATABASE; ASSAY
10.1016_j.ijpharm.2015.07.001	Inhalable spray-dried formulation of D-LAK antimicrobial peptides targeting tuberculosis	Tuberculosis (TB) is a global disease that is becoming more difficult to treat due to the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Inhalable antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are potentially useful alternative anti-TB agents because they can overcome resistance against classical antibiotics, reduce systemic adverse effects, and achieve local targeting. The aims of the current study were to produce inhalable dry powders containing D-enantiomeric AMPs (D-LAK120-HP13 and D-LAK120-A) and evaluate their solid state properties, aerosol performance, and structural conformation. These two peptides were spray dried with mannitol as a bulking agent at three mass ratios (peptide: mannitol 1:99, 1:49, and 1:24) from aqueous solutions. The resultant particles were spherical, with those containing D-LAK120-HP13 being more corrugated than those with D-LAK120-A. The median volumetric diameter of the particles was approximately 3 mu m. The residual water content of all powders were <3% w/w and crystalline, due to the low hygroscopicity and crystallinity of mannitol, respectively. The mannitol changed from a mixture of alpha-and beta-forms to delta form with an increasing proportion of AMP in the formulation. The emitted fraction and fine particle fraction of the powders when dispersed from an Osmohaler (R) at 90 L/min were about 80% and 50-60% of the loaded dose, respectively, indicating good aerosol performance. Circular dichroism data showed that D-LAK120-HP13 dissolved in Tris buffer at pH 7.15 was of a disordered conformation. In contrast, D-LAK120-A showed greater alpha-helical conformation. Since the conformations of the AMPs were comparable to the controls (unprocessed peptides), the spray drying process did not substantially affect their secondary structures. In conclusion, spray dried powders containing D-enantiomeric AMPs with preserved secondary molecular structures and good aerosol performance could be successfully produced. They may potentially be used for treating MDR-TB when delivered by inhalation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

10.1093_jac_dkv110	Identification of an anti-TB compound targeting the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase	Objectives: Drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis poses a great threat to human health. Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) is one of the aminoacyl tRNA synthetases that catalyse the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs and are essential for protein synthesis. There are several distinctive differences between bacterial and human TyrRS and therefore it could be a potential target for developing antimicrobial agents. This study aimed to identify a new anti-TB agent targeting M. tuberculosis TyrRS (MtTyrRS). Methods: We first used Mycobacterium smegmatis for a phenotypic screening of 20000 compounds. The hit compounds were then screened with MtTyrRS. The interaction between hit compound IMB-T130 and the target protein was analysed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay and molecular docking experiments. The target of IMB-T130 was further confirmed by the overexpression of the target protein. The antibacterial activity of IMB-T130 against various standard and clinical drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains was evaluated using the microplate Alamar blue assay. Results: Compound IMB-T130 was identified as a hit compound that inhibits the growth of M. smegmatis and the in vitro activity of MtTyrRS. The interaction between IMB-T130 and MtTyrRS was confirmed by SPR assay and molecular docking analysis. The higher MIC for a strain overexpressing the target protein also suggests that MtTyrRS is likely to be the target of IMB-T130. IMB-T130 shows excellent anti-TB activity and low cytotoxicity. Conclusions: IMB-T130 inhibits the growth of MDR-TB and XDR-TB by targeting MtTyrRS.

10.1093_jac_dkv112	The indirect microscopic observation drug susceptibility assay demonstrated high concordance with the indirect MGIT method for pyrazinamide susceptibility testing	Objectives: The microscopic observation drug susceptibility (MODS) assay has been used for Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection and anti-TB drug susceptibility tests for several years, and our study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of MODS in detecting pyrazinamide resistance in MDR TB suspects. Methods: One hundred and forty-eight clinical isolates were collected from 148 MDR TB suspects in the Nanjing Chest Hospital, and the MODS and the mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) 960 methods for pyrazinamide susceptibility testing were conducted for each isolate independently. pncA gene sequencing was applied to confirm results showing discrepancy between the MODS and MGIT 960 methods. The McNemar chi(2) test was employed to evaluate the paired 2x2 table. Results: Compared with the MGIT 960 method, the sensitivity and specificity of the MODS assay were 95.5% and 93.3%, respectively, with a high accuracy of 94.5%. The kappa value of 0.89 showed near-perfect agreement for the two methods in determining pyrazinamide susceptibility. Eight clinical isolates showed inconsistent results by MODS and MGIT 960. After sequencing the pncA gene of the eight isolates, MODS and MGIT 960 showed no significant difference in detecting pyrazinamide resistance when compared with pncA gene sequencing (P = 0.655 for MODS and P = 0.564 for MGIT 960). Conclusions: The high accuracy of MODS in detecting pyrazinamide resistance showed that the MODS method would be an alternative for pyrazinamide susceptibility testing; other mutations affecting resistance to pyrazinamide need to be identified in order to elucidate the discrepant results between phenotype-and genotype-based methods.	tuberculosis; TB; MODS; pncA	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MODS ASSAY; 960 SYSTEM; RESISTANCE; GENE; MUTATIONS; DIAGNOSIS; PNCA; RPSA; TB
10.1186_s12879_015_1057_y	Genetic diversity and molecular epidemiology of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Minas Gerais State, Brazil	Background: We aimed to characterize the genetic diversity of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) clinical isolates and investigate the molecular epidemiology of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis from Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Methods: One hundred and four MTb clinical isolates were assessed by IS6110-RFLP, 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units variable-number tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR), TB-SPRINT (simultaneous spoligotyping and rifampicin-isoniazid drug-resistance mutation analysis) and 3R-SNP-typing (analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes involved in replication, recombination and repair functions). Results: Fifty-seven different IS6110-RFLP patterns were found, among which 50 had unique patterns and 17 were grouped into seven clusters. The discriminatory index (Hunter and Gaston, HGDI) for RFLP was 0.9937. Ninety-nine different MIRU-VNTR patterns were found, 95 of which had unique patterns and nine isolates were grouped into four clusters. The major allelic diversity index in the MIRU-VNTR loci ranged from 0.6568 to 0.7789. The global HGDI for MIRU-VNTR was 0.9991. Thirty-two different spoligotyping profiles were found: 16 unique patterns (n = 16) and 16 clustered profiles (n = 88). The HGDI for spoligotyping was 0.9009. The spoligotyped clinical isolates were phylogenetically classified into Latin-American Mediterranean (66.34 %), T (14.42 %), Haarlem (5.76 %), X (1.92 %), S (1.92 %) and U (unknown profile; 8.65 %). Among the U isolates, 77.8 % were classified further by 3R-SNP-typing as 44.5 % Haarlem and 33.3 % LAM, while the 22.2 % remaining were not classified. Among the 104 clinical isolates, 86 were identified by TB-SPRINT as MDR, 12 were resistant to rifampicin only, one was resistant to isoniazid only, three were susceptible to both drugs, and two were not successfully amplified by PCR. A total of 42, 28 and eight isolates had mutations in rpoB positions 531, 526 and 516, respectively. Correlating the cluster analysis with the patient data did not suggest recent transmission of MDR-TB. Conclusions: Although our results do not suggest strong transmission of MDR-TB in Minas Gerais (using a classical 100 % MDR-TB identical isolates cluster definition), use of a smoother cluster definition (>85 % similarity) does not allow us to fully eliminate this possibility; hence, around 20-30 % of the isolates we analyzed might be MDR-TB transmission cases.

10.5588_ijtld.14.0703	Comparing multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patient costs under molecular diagnostic algorithms in South Africa	SETTING: Ten primary health care facilities in Cape Town, South Africa, 2010-2013. OBJECTIVE: A comparison of costs incurred by patients in GenoType (R) MDRTBplus line-probe assay (LPA) and Xpert (R) MTB/RIF-based diagnostic algorithms from symptom onset until treatment initiation for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). METHODS: Eligible patients identified from laboratory and facility records were interviewed 3-6 months after treatment initiation and a cost questionnaire completed. Direct and indirect costs, individual and household income, loss of individual income and change in household income were recorded in local currency, adjusted to 2013 costs and converted to $US. RESULTS: Median number of visits to initiation of MDR-TB treatment was reduced from 20 to 7 (P < 0.001) and median costs fell from US$68.1 to US$38.3 (P = 0.004) in the Xpert group. From symptom onset to being interviewed, the proportion of unemployed increased from 39% to 73% in the LPA group (P < 0.001) and from 53% to 89% in the Xpert group (P < 0.001). Median household income decreased by 16% in the LPA group and by 13% in the Xpert group. CONCLUSION: The introduction of an Xpert-based algorithm brought relief by reducing the costs incurred by patients, but loss of employment and income persist. Patients require support to mitigate this impact.	molecular diagnostic tests; patient costs; income loss; impact assessment	ECONOMIC BURDEN; DETERMINANTS; ILLNESS; IMPACT
10.1183_09031936.00147014	Evaluation of macrolides for possible use against multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major global health problem. The loss of susceptibility to an increasing number of drugs behoves us to consider the evaluation of non-traditional anti-tuberculosis drugs. Clarithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, is defined as a group 5 anti-tuberculosis drug by the World Health Organization; however, its role or efficacy in the treatment of MDR-TB is unclear. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to summarise the evidence for the activity of macrolides against MDR-TB, by evaluating in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies. PubMed and Embase were searched for English language articles up to May 2014. Even though high minimum inhibitory concentration values are usually found, suggesting low activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the potential benefits of macrolides are their accumulation in the relevant compartments and cells in the lungs, their immunomodulatory effects and their synergistic activity with other anti-TB drugs. A future perspective may be use of more potent macrolide analogues to enhance the activity of the treatment regimen.

10.1371_journal.pone.0133869	A Global Perspective on Pyrazinamide Resistance: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	Background Pyrazinamide (PZA) is crucial for tuberculosis (TB) treatment, given its unique ability to eradicate persister bacilli. The worldwide burden of PZA resistance remains poorly described. Methods Systematic PubMed, Science Direct and Scopus searches for articles reporting phenotypic (liquid culture drug susceptibility testing or pyrazinamidase activity assays) and/or genotypic (polymerase chain reaction or DNA sequencing) PZA resistance. Global and regional summary estimates were obtained from random-effects meta-analysis, stratified by presence or risk of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB). Regional summary estimates were combined with regional WHO TB incidence estimates to determine the annual burden of PZA resistance. Information on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the pncA gene was aggregated to obtain a global summary. Results Pooled PZA resistance prevalence estimate was 16.2% (95% CI 11.2-21.2) among all TB cases, 41.3%(29.0-53.7) among patients at high MDR-TB risk, and 60.5% (52.3-68.6) among MDR-TB cases. The estimated global burden is 1.4 million new PZA resistant TB cases annually, about 270,000 in MDR-TB patients. Among 1,815 phenotypically resistant isolates, 608 unique SNPs occurred at 397 distinct positions throughout the pncA gene. Interpretation PZA resistance is ubiquitous, with an estimated one in six incident TB cases and more than half of all MDR-TB cases resistant to PZA globally. The diversity of SNPs across the pncA gene complicates the development of rapid molecular diagnostics. These findings caution against relying on PZA in current and future TB drug regimens, especially in MDR-TB patients.

10.1371_journal.pone.0133808	Antituberculosis Drug Resistance Survey in Lesotho, 2008-2009: Lessons Learned	Setting Drug resistance is an increasing threat to tuberculosis (TB) control worldwide. The World Health Organization advises monitoring for drug resistance, with either ongoing surveillance or periodic surveys. Methods The antituberculosis drug resistance survey was conducted in Lesotho in 2008-2009. Basic demographic and TB history information was collected from individuals with positive sputum smear results at 17 diagnostic facilities. Additional sputum sample was sent to the national TB reference laboratory for culture and drug susceptibility testing. Results Among 3441 eligible smear-positive persons, 1121 (32.6%) were not requested to submit sputum for culture. Among 2320 persons submitted sputum, 1164 (50.2%) were not asked for clinical information or did not have valid sputum samples for testing. In addition, 445/ 2320 (19.2%) were excluded from analysis because of other laboratory or data management reasons. Among 984/3441 (28.6%) persons who had data available for analysis, MDR-TB was present in 24/773 (3.1%) of new and 25/195 (12.8%) of retreatment TB cases. Logistical, operational and data management challenges affected survey results. Conclusion MDR-TB is prevalent in Lesotho, but limitations reduced the reliability of our findings. Multiple lessons learned during this survey can be applied to improve the next drug resistance survey in Lesotho and other resource constrained countries may learn how to avoid these bottlenecks.

10.1371_journal.pone.0132514	Effect of Introducing Xpert MTB/RIF to Test and Treat Individuals at Risk of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Kazakhstan: A Prospective Cohort Study	Background Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) was piloted in Kazakhstan to detect tuberculosis (TB) and rifampicin resistance (RR-) TB among individuals at risk of multidrug-resistant (MDR-) TB. This study assessed the performance of Xpert compared to conventional diagnostic methods, RR-TB case detection among various risk groups, treatment initiation and time to diagnosis and treatment. Methods Eligible individuals were tested with Xpert, smear microscopy, culture and drug-susceptibility testing (DST) at the national TB reference laboratory and three provincial laboratories. Data was collected prospectively from August 2012 to May 2013 from routine laboratory and treatment registers. Results A total of 5,611 Xpert tests were performed mostly targeting contacts of MDR-TB patients, 'other' presumptive MDR-TB patients, and retreatment cases (26%, 24% and 22%, respectively). Compared to phenotypic DST, the positive predictive value of Xpert to detect RR-TB was 93.1% and 96.4% and the negative predictive value was 94.6% and 92.7% using solid and liquid culture media, respectively. RR-TB detection was highest among (former) prisoners, retreatment cases, people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and TB patients with positive smears after intensive phase of treatment (59%, 58%, 54% and 53% among TB positives, respectively). 88.9% of RR-TB patients were registered to have started second-line TB treatment. Median time to diagnosis with Xpert was 0.0 days (IQR 0.0-1.0), time from diagnosis to start of first-line treatment 3.0 days (IQR 1.0-7.0), and to start of second-line treatment 7.0 days (IQR 4.0-16). Conclusions Compared to conventional culture and DST, Xpert had a shorter result turn-around-time and excellent concordance to detect RR-TB. Time from sputum collection to start of second-line treatment was reduced to one week. The yield of Xpert could be maximized by increasing referrals from penitentiary and HIV centers to TB centers.		SURVEILLANCE
10.1038_emi.2015.42	Novel katG mutations causing isoniazid resistance in clinical M. tuberculosis isolates	We report the discovery and confirmation of 23 novel mutations with previously undocumented role in isoniazid (INH) drug resistance, in catalase-peroxidase (katG) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) isolates. With these mutations, a synonymous mutation in fabG1 g609a, and two canonical mutations, we were able to explain 98% of the phenotypic resistance observed in 366 clinical Mtb isolates collected from four high tuberculosis (TB)-burden countries: India, Moldova, Philippines, and South Africa. We conducted overlapping targeted and whole-genome sequencing for variant discovery in all clinical isolates with a variety of INH-resistant phenotypes. Our analysis showed that just two canonical mutations (katG 315AGC-ACC and inhA promoter-15C-T) identified 89.5% of resistance phenotypes in our collection. Inclusion of the 23 novel mutations reported here, and the previously documented point mutation in fabG1, increased the sensitivity of these mutations as markers of INH resistance to 98%. Only six (2%) of the 332 resistant isolates in our collection did not harbor one or more of these mutations. The third most prevalent substitution, at inhA promoter position -8, present in 39 resistant isolates, was of no diagnostic significance since it always co-occurred with katG 315. 79% of our isolates harboring novel mutations belong to genetic group 1 indicating a higher tendency for this group to go down an uncommon evolutionary path and evade molecular diagnostics. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of INH resistance in Mtb isolates that lack the canonical mutations and could improve the sensitivity of next generation molecular diagnostics.	isoniazid drug-resistance; katG; MDR-TB; novel mutation; Pyrosequencing; Sanger sequencing; tuberculosis; whole-genome sequencing	RAPID MOLECULAR-DETECTION; CATALASE-PEROXIDASE GENE; DNA-SEQUENCING DATA; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE; DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS; POINT MUTATION; SMEGMATIS; INHA
10.1016_j.ejmech.2015.05.048	Discovery of antitubercular 2,4-diphenyl-1H-imidazoles from chemical library repositioning and rational design	TB, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is one of the deadliest infections worldwide. The co-infection with HIV and the emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) strains have further increased the burden for this disease. In the attempt to respond to the constant need of novel therapeutic options, we herein report the discovery of 2,4-diphenyl-1H-imidazoles as effective antitubercular agents, with MIC in the low micromolar range against actively replicating and persistent M. tuberculosis strains. The good activity, along with the lack of toxicity and the feasible synthesis, underscore their value as novel scaffolds for the development of new anti-TB drugs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

10.1164_rccm.201501_0069OC	Fluoroquinolone Therapy for the Prevention of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Contacts A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis	Rationale: Fluoroquinolone (FQN) therapy of latent tuberculosis infection among contacts of individuals with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is controversial. Objectives: To determine the potential benefits, risks (including acquired FQN resistance), and cost-effectiveness of FQN therapy to prevent TB in contacts of individuals with MDR-TB. Methods: We used decision analysis to estimate costs and outcomes associated with no therapy compared with a 6-month course of daily FQN therapy to treat latent TB infection in contacts of individuals with MDR-TB. Outcomes modeled were the incidence of MDR-TB, MDR-TB with FQN resistance, TB-related death, quality-adjusted life years, and health system costs. Measurements and Main Results: FQN preventive therapy resulted in health system savings, lower incidence of MDR-TB, and lower mortality than no treatment. We found the incidence of MDR-TB with acquired FQN resistance would also be lower with FQN therapy of infected contacts. Conclusions: In our model, FQN preventive therapy resulted in substantial health system savings and in reduced mortality, incidence of MDR-TB, and incidence of acquired FQN-resistant disease as well as improved quality of life. FQN therapy remained cost saving with improved outcomes even if the effectiveness of therapy in preventing MDR-TB was as low as 10%.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; antitubercular agents; cost-effectiveness analysis; latent tuberculosis infection	SOUTHEAST-ASIAN REFUGEES; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; IN-VITRO; ACTIVE TUBERCULOSIS; UNITED-STATES; DOUBLE-BLIND; MDR-TB; MOXIFLOXACIN; INFECTION
10.1371_journal.pone.0132543	Loss-To-Follow-Up on Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment in Gujarat, India: The WHEN and WHO of It	Background Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a rising global threat to public health and concerted efforts for its treatment are diluted if the outcomes are not successful, loss to follow up (LFU) being one of them. It is therefore necessary to know the proportion and the associated reasons for LFU and devise effective patient-centered strategies to improve retention in care. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the MDR-TB treatment site (DR-TB Site) in Central Gujarat among all patients registered from February 2010 to June 2013. LFU patients were defined as those whose treatment was interrupted for two or more consecutive months for any reason. Descriptive statistics, survival analysis and multivariate modeling were used to determine the proportion of patients LFU and to assess associations between LFU and selected demographic and clinical factors. Results A total of 796 patients were enrolled during the study period; 71.9% were male and the median age was 35 years [Interquartile range (IQR) 27-45]. The overall proportion of LFU patients was 153/796 (19.2%). The majority of LFU patients (133/153 i.e. 87%) were lost within the first 6 months of treatment. Ambulatory treatment initiation (adjusted Hazards ratio aHR=2.63, CI: 1.01-6.86), different providers in IP and CP (aHR=1.27, CI: 1.18-1.38) and culture conversion after more than 4 months of treatment(aHR=1.34, CI: 1.21-1.49) were found to be significantly associated with LFU in multivariate models. Conclusions A high proportion of LFU among patients on MDR-TB treatment was found in a programmatic setting in India. Clinical but equally important programmatic factors were associated with LFU, accounting for one-fifth of all the outcomes of MDR-TB treatment. Proper training for DOT providers and aggressive counseling and health system strengthening with patient friendly follow up services may help reduce LFU.		TREATMENT OUTCOMES; DEFAULT; METAANALYSIS
10.1016_j.jconrel.2015.05.001	Capreomycin oleate microparticles for intramuscular administration: Preparation, in vitro release and preliminary in vivo evaluation	Capreomycin sulfate (CS) is a second-line drug used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The adverse effects profile and uncomfortable administration scheme of CS has led to the development of formulations based on liposomes and polymeric microparticles. However, as CS is a water-soluble peptide that does not encapsulate properly into hydrophobic particulate matrices, it was necessary to reduce its aqueous solubility by forming the pharmacologically active capreomycin oleate (CO) ion pair. The aim of this research was to develop a new formulation of CO for intramuscular injection, based on biodegradable microparticles that encapsulate CO in order to provide a controlled release of the drug with reduced local and systemic adverse effects. The CO-loaded microparticles prepared by spray drying or solvent emulsion-evaporation were characterized in their morphology, encapsulation efficiency, in vitro/in vivo kinetics and tissue tolerance. Through scanning electron microscopy it was confirmed that the microparticles were monodisperse and spherical, with an optimal size for intramuscular administration. The interaction between CO and the components of the microparticle matrix was confirmed on both formulations by X-ray powder diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry analyses. The encapsulation efficiencies for the spray-dried and emulsion-evaporation microparticles were 92% and 56%, respectively. The in vitro kinetics performed on both formulations demonstrated a controlled and continuous release of CO from the microparticles, which was successfully reproduced on an in vivo rodent model. The results of the histological analysis demonstrated that none of the formulations produced significant tissue damage on the site of injection. Therefore, the results suggest that injectable CO microparticles obtained by spray drying and solvent emulsion-evaporation could represent an interesting therapeutic alternative for the treatment of MDR-TB.

10.1186_s12889_015_1955_3	Drug resistance patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and associated factors among retreatment cases around Jimma, Southwest Ethiopia	Background: Information on the pattern of drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) among re-treatment cases is crucial to develop appropriate control strategies. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the drug resistance pattern of M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates and associated factors among re-treatment cases in Jimma area, Southwest Ethiopia. Methods: Health facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted between March 2012 and April 2013 in Jimma area, Southwest Ethiopia. We included 79 re-treatment cases selected conveniently. Socio demographic and clinical data were collected using structured questionnaire. Sputum sample processing, mycobacterial culture, isolation and drug susceptibility testing (DST) were done at Mycobacteriology Research Centre (MRC) of Jimma University. All data were registered and entered in to SPSS version 20. Crude odds ratio (COR) and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) were calculated. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: Seventy-nine re-treatment cases included in the study; 48 (60.8 %) were males. Forty-seven (59.5 %) study participants were from rural area with the mean age of 31.67 +/- 10.02 SD. DST results were available for 70 MTBC isolates. Majority (58.6 % (41/70)) isolates were resistant to at least one of the four first line drugs. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was 31.4 % (22/70). Place of residence (AOR = 3.44 (95 % CI: 1.12, 10.60), duration of illness (AOR = 3.00 (95 % CI: 1.17, 10.69) and frequency of prior TB therapy (AOR = 2.99, (95 % CI: 1.01, 8.86) were significant factors for any drug resistance. Moreover, history of treatment failure was found to be associated with MDR-TB (AOR = 3.43 (95 % CI: 1.14, 10.28). Conclusion: The overall prevalence of MDR-TB among re-treatment cases around Jimma was high. The rate of MDR-TB was higher in patients with the history of anti-TB treatment failure. Timely identification and referral of patients with the history of treatment failure for culture and DST need to be strengthened.

10.4103_0255_0857.158560	Mutations at embB306 codon and their association with multidrug resistant M. tuberculosis clinical isolates	Purpose: The presence of embB306 mutation in ethambutol (EMB)-susceptible (EMBs) clinical isolates questions the significance of these mutations in conferring resistance to EMB. The present study was carried out to determine the occurrence of embB306 mutation in EMB-resistant (EMBr) and EMBs strains of M. tuberculosis. One hundred and four multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains were also included to establish the relevance of excessive use of rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) in occurrence of embB306 mutations in EMBs M. tuberculosis isolates. Materials and Methods: Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from M. tuberculosis clinical strains was isolated by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method. Phenotypic and genotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed on 354 M. tuberculosis isolates by using standard proportion method and multiplex-allele-specific polymerase chain reaction assay, respectively. Results: The overall frequency of embB306 mutations in EMBr isolates was found to be five times higher than its occurrence in EMB-susceptible isolates (50% vs 10%). Further, the association between embB306 mutation and EMB-resistance was observed to be statistically significant (P = 0.000). Conclusion: The embB306 is not only the main causative mutation of EMB resistance, but is a sensitive applicant marker for EMB-resistance study.

10.5812_jjm.8_5_2015.18274	Molecular Epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates in 100 Patients With Tuberculosis Using Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis	Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is a widespread infectious disease. Today, TB has created a public health crisis in the world. Genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates is useful for surveying the dynamics of TB infection, identifying new outbreaks, and preventing the disease. Different molecular methods for clustering of M. tuberculosis isolates have been used. Objectives: During a one year study of genotyping, 100 M. tuberculosis isolates from patients referred to Pasteur Institute of Iran were collected and their genotyping was accomplished using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method. Materials and Methods: Identification of all M. tuberculosis isolates was accomplished using standard biochemical and species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed using proportional method. After preparing PFGE plaques for each isolate of M. tuberculosis, XbaI restriction enzyme was applied for genome digestion. Finally, the digested DNA fragments were separated on 1% agarose gel and analyzed with GelCompar II software. Results: Genotyping of the studied isolates in comparison with the molecular weight marker revealed two common types; pulsotype A with 71 isolates and one multidrug resistant mycobacterium (MDR) case, and pulsotype B including 29 isolates and three MDR cases. No correlation between the antibiotypes and pulsotypes was observed. Conclusions: Molecular epidemiology studies of infectious diseases have been useful when bacterial isolates have been clustered in a period of time and in different geographical regions with variable antibiotic resistance patterns. In spite of high geographical differences and different antibiotic resistant patterns, low genetic diversity among the studied TB isolates may refer to the low rate of mutations in XbaI restriction sites in the mycobacterial genome. We also identified three MDR isolates in low-incidence pulsotype B, which could be disseminated and is highly important to consider in TB surveillance programs to prevent the spread of MDR-TB isolates in the population.

10.1128_AAC.00341_15	Limited Sampling Strategy and Target Attainment Analysis for Levofloxacin in Patients with Tuberculosis	There is an urgent need to improve and shorten the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Levofloxacin, a newer fluoroquinolone, has potent activity against TB both in vitro and in vivo. Levofloxacin dosing can be optimized to improve the treatment of both TB and MDR-TB. Levofloxacin efficacy is linked primarily to the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve for the free fraction of drug (fAUC) to the MIC. Since obtaining a full-time concentration profile is not feasible in the clinic, we developed a limited sampling strategy (LSS) to estimate the AUC. We also utilized Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the dosing of levofloxacin. Pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 10 Brazilian TB patients. The pharmacokinetic data were fitted with a one-compartment model. LSSs were developed using two methods: linear regression and Bayesian approaches. Several LSSs predicted levofloxacin AUC with good accuracy and precision. The most accurate were the method using two samples collected at 4 and 6 h (R-2 = 0.91 using linear regression and 0.97 using Bayesian approaches) and that using samples collected at 2 and 6 h (R-2 = 0.90 using linear regression and 0.96 using Bayesian approaches). The 2-and-6-h approach also provides a good estimate of the maximum concentration of the drug in serum (C-max). Our target attainment analysis showed that higher doses (17 to 20 mg/kg of body weight) of levofloxacin might be needed to improve its activity. Doses in the range of 17 to 20 mg/kg showed good target attainment for MICs from 0.25 to 0.50. At an MIC of 2, poor target attainment was observed across all doses.

10.1128_AAC.00614_15	Determination of MIC Distribution and Epidemiological Cutoff Values for Bedaquiline and Delamanid in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Using the MGIT 960 System Equipped with TB eXiST	Bedaquiline (Sirturo) and delamanid (Deltyba) have recently been approved by the regulatory authorities for treatment of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not established for either substance. On the basis of the use of the MGIT 960 system equipped with EpiCenter/TB eXiST, we determined a mean bedaquiline MIC for wild-type strains of 0.65 mg/liter (median, 0.4 mg/liter) and an epidemiological cutoff (ECOFF) of 1.6 mg/liter; for delamanid, a mean wild-type drug MIC of 0.013 mg/liter (median, 0.01 mg/liter) and an ECOFF of 0.04 mg/liter were determined.

pub-0582	PREVALENCE AND FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS AT SIRIRAJ HOSPITAL, BANGKOK, THAILAND	The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and factors associated with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. We conducted a retrospective unmatched case-control study of patients clinically diagnosed and microbiologically confirmed to have tuberculosis (TB) at Siriraj Hospital from 2010 to 2012. Patient characteristics, clinical data, microbiological findings, outcomes and drug susceptibilities were recorded. A total of 188 subjects were included in the study; 52.1% (98) were males; the mean age was 48.9 years. Subjects were categorized into one of two groups, as follows: non-MDR-TB (141 patients) and MDR-TB (47 patients). The prevalence of MDR-TB was 2.6%. Co-morbidities of study subjects included diabetes mellitus (16.5%), HIV infection (16%) and cancer (5.9%). One hundred thirty-one patients (69.7%) had pulmonary TB. Factors significantly associated with MDR-TB were age <65 years (OR=6.94; 95% CI: 1.02-45.49; p=0.048), history of TB (OR=51.86; 95%CI: 12.35-217.79; p<0.001), HIV co-infection (OR=3.83; 95% CI: 1.02-14.38; p=0.047) and alcohol consumption (OR=3.90; 95% CI: 1.03-14.72; p=0.045). Of the 146 patients for whom a clinical outcome was available, 51 (34.9%) had an unfavorable outcome. Poor compliance (OR=13.51; 95% CI: 3.97-45.45; p<0.001) and previous history of TB (OR=8.16; 95% CI: 1.76-37.73; p=0.007) were associated with an unfavorable outcome. MDR-TB was significantly associated with: patients aged <65 years, those with a previous history of TB, those with HIV co-infection and those who drank alcohol. These factors should be kept in mind when treating TB patients at Siriraj Hospital, Thailand.	tuberculosis; multidrug resistance; associated factors; prevalence; Thailand	IN-VIVO ACTIVITIES; RISK-FACTORS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; UNITED-KINGDOM; ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; HIV; CIPROFLOXACIN; OUTCOMES
10.1371_journal.pone.0131438	The Potential Impact of Up-Front Drug Sensitivity Testing on India's Epidemic of Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis	Background In India as elsewhere, multi-drug resistance (MDR) poses a serious challenge in the control of tuberculosis (TB). The End TB strategy, recently approved by the world health assembly, aims to reduce TB deaths by 95% and new cases by 90% between 2015 and 2035. A key pillar of this approach is early diagnosis of tuberculosis, including use of higher-sensitivity diagnostic testing and universal rapid drug susceptibility testing (DST). Despite limitations of current laboratory assays, universal access to rapid DST could become more feasible with the advent of new and emerging technologies. Here we use a mathematical model of TB transmission, calibrated to the TB epidemic in India, to explore the potential impact of a major national scale-up of rapid DST. To inform key parameters in a clinical setting, we take GeneXpert as an example of a technology that could enable such scale-up. We draw from a recent multi-centric demonstration study conducted in India that involved upfront Xpert MTB/ RIF testing of all TB suspects. Results We find that widespread, public-sector deployment of high-sensitivity diagnostic testing and universal DST appropriately linked with treatment could substantially impact MDR-TB in India. Achieving 75% access over 3 years amongst all cases being diagnosed for TB in the public sector alone could avert over 180,000 cases of MDR-TB (95% CI 44187 - 317077 cases) between 2015 and 2025. Sufficiently wide deployment of Xpert could, moreover, turn an increasing MDR epidemic into a diminishing one. Synergistic effects were observed with assumptions of simultaneously improving MDR-TB treatment outcomes. Our results illustrate the potential impact of new and emerging technologies that enable widespread, timely DST, and the important effect that universal rapid DST in the public sector can have on the MDR-TB epidemic in India.

10.3349_ymj.2015.56.4.961	Low Serum Concentrations of Moxifloxacin, Prothionamide, and Cycloserine on Sputum Conversion in Multi-Drug Resistant TB	Purpose: Low serum concentrations of drugs used to treat multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) have occasionally been associated with treatment failure. We determined the frequencies of low serum concentrations of anti-MDR-TB drugs, and assessed the effects of these concentrations on 2-month sputum conversion. Materials and Methods: The serum levels of moxifloxacin (MF), prothionamide (PTH), and cycloserine (CS) were determined for 89 serum samples by high-pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Low serum concentrations of MF, PTH, and CS below the minimal levels of the normal ranges were 83.3% (20/24), 59.2% (29/49), and 71.2% (47/66), respectively. There were no significant differences between the 2-month sputum conversion group (n=25) and the 2-month sputum non-conversion group (n=4) in median drug concentrations (mu g/mL) of MF (1.46 vs. 1.60), PTH (0.91 vs. 0.70), and CS (14.90 vs. 14.90). However, a poor compliance rate was significantly greater in the 2-month sputum non-conversion group (75.0%, 3/4) than in the 2-month sputum conversion group (0%, 0/25) (p=0.001). Conclusion: The frequency of low serum concentrations of anti-MDR-TB drugs was substantial and might not affect the 2-month sputum conversion rate. Larger prospective studies with timely sampling are needed to investigate the role of therapeutic drug monitoring in MDR-TB.

10.5588_ijtld.14.0575	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in New South Wales, Australia, 1999-2010: a case series report	SETTING: The emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) threatens the ongoing control of tuberculosis (TB). The Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) has low TB and MDR-TB incidence. OBJECTIVE: To examine the epidemiology and the clinical and public health management of MDR-TB in NSW. DESIGN: A retrospective case-series analysis of MDR-TB diagnosed in NSW between 1999 and 2010 was undertaken. A standardised questionnaire was used to collect information from the public health surveillance system, medical records and the State Mycobacterium Reference Laboratory about clinical features, drug susceptibility, treatment regimens, hospitalisation, risk factors for tuberculous infection, contact tracing and patient outcomes. RESULTS: Fifty-five cases of culture-confirmed MDR-TB, including two cases of extensively drug-resistant TB, were diagnosed. All cases were reviewed by an expert management panel. Fifty cases (91%) were foreign-born, and 50 cases (91%) had fully supervised treatment. Of the 55 cases, 46 (84%) successfully completed treatment, 3 (5%) died of TB and 3 (5%) required surgery. No MDR-TB cases were reported among contacts. CONCLUSION: Using a multidisciplinary, expert guided, case-management approach, the NSW TB Control Program achieved excellent MDR-TB outcomes. The impact of global increases in MDR-TB requires sustained commitment to TB in all settings.	epidemiology; public health; antimicrobial resistance; treatment; outcome	TREATMENT OUTCOMES
10.1016_j.ijantimicag.2015.02.018	Transcriptional and proteomic analyses of two-component response regulators in multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Two-component systems (TCSs) have been reported to exhibit a sensing and responding role under drug stress that induces drug resistance in several bacterial species. However, the relationship between TCSs and multidrug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis has not been comprehensively analysed to date. In this study, 90 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates were analysed using 15-loci mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit (MIRU)-variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) typing and repetitive extragenic palindromic (rep)-PCR-based DNA fingerprinting. The results showed that all of the isolates were of the Beijing lineage, and strains with a drug-susceptible phenotype had not diverged into similar genotype clusters. Expression analysis of 13 response regulators of TCSs using real-time PCR and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) proteomic analysis demonstrated that four response regulator genes (devR, mtrA, regX3 and Rv3143) were significantly upregulated in multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains compared with the laboratory strain H37Rv as well as drug-susceptible and isoniazid-monoresistant strains (P < 0.05). DNA sequencing revealed that the promoter regions of devR, mtrA, regX3 and Rv3143 did not contain any mutations. Moreover, expression of the four genes could be induced by most of the four first-line antitubercular agents. In addition, either deletion or overexpression of devR in Mycobacterium bovis BCG did not alter its sensitivity to the four antitubercular drugs. This suggests that upregulation of devR, which is common in MDR-TB strains, might be induced by drug stress and hypoxic adaptation following the acquisition of multidrug resistance.

10.5588_ijtld.14.0767	Tuberculosis in Malaysia: predictors of treatment outcomes in a national registry	OBJECTIVES: To determine treatment outcomes and associated predictors of all patients registered in 2012 with the Malaysian National Tuberculosis (TB) Surveillance Registry. METHODS: Sociodemographic and clinical data were analysed. Unfavourable outcomes included treatment failure, transferred out and lost to follow-up, treatment defaulters, those not evaluated and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: In total, 21 582 patients were registered. The mean age was 42.36 +/- 17.77 years, and 14.2% were non-Malaysians. The majority were new cases (93.6%). One fifth (21.5%) had unfavourable outcomes; of these, 46% died, 49% transferred out or defaulted and 1% failed treatment. Predictors of unfavourable outcomes were older age, male sex, foreign citizenship, lower education, no bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination scar, treatment in tertiary settings, smoking, previous anti-tuberculosis treatment, human immunodeficiency virus infection, not receiving directly observed treatment, advanced chest radiography findings, multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extra-pulmonary TB. For all-cause mortality, predictors were similar except for rural dwelling and nationality (higher mortality among locals). Absence of BCG scar, previous treatment for TB and MDR-TB were not found to be predictors of all-cause mortality. Indigenous populations in East Malaysia had lower rates of unfavourable treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: One fifth of TB patients had unfavourable outcomes. Intervention strategies should target those at increased risk of unfavourable outcomes and all-cause mortality.	treatment outcome; risk factors; tuberculosis; indigenous populations	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; RISK-FACTORS; COHORT; FINLAND; IMPACT
10.1371_journal.pone.0129155	The Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis Diagnosis and Treatment Cascade in Bangladesh	Objectives To determine, in areas supported by BRAC, Bangladesh i) the pre-diagnosis and pre-treatment attrition among presumptive and confirmed Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients and ii) factors associated with attrition. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study involving record review. Presumptive MDR-TB patients from peripheral microscopy centres serving 60% of the total population of Bangladesh were included in the study. Attrition and turnaround time for MDR-TB diagnosis by Xpert MTB/ RIF and treatment initiation were calculated between July 2012 and June 2014. Results Of 836 presumptive MDR-TB patients referred from 398 peripheral microscopy centres, 161 MDR-TB patients were diagnosed. The number of diagnosed MDR-TB patients was less than country estimates of MDR-TB patients (2000 cases) during the study period. Among those referred, pre-diagnosis and pre-treatment attrition was 17% and 21% respectively. Median turnaround time for MDR-TB testing, result receipt and treatment initiation was four, zero and five days respectively. Farmers (RR=2.3, p=0.01) and daily wage laborers (RR=2.1, p=0.04) had twice the risk of having pre-diagnosis attrition. Poor record-keeping and unreliable upkeep of presumptive MDR-TB patient databases were identified as challenges at the peripheral microscopy centres. Conclusion There was a low proportion of pre-diagnosis and pre-treatment attrition in patients with presumptive and confirmed MDR-TB under programmatic conditions. However, the recording and reporting system did not detect all presumptive MDR-TB patients, highlighting the need to improve the system in order to prevent morbidity, mortality and transmission of MDR-TB in the community.

10.1371_journal.pone.0128500	Procurement and Supply Management System for MDR-TB in Nigeria: Are the Early Warning Targets for Drug Stock Outs and Over Stock of Drugs Being Achieved?	Background The World Health Organisation (WHO) introduced the twelve early warning indicators for monitoring and evaluating drug Procurement and Supply management (PSM) systems, intended to prevent drug stock-outs and overstocking. Nigeria- one of the high Multi Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) burden countries, scaled-up treatment in 2012 with the concurrent implementation of a PSM system. Method We evaluated how well this system functioned using the WHO indicators, including all seven MDR-TB treatment centres in the country that were functional throughout 2013. Results The quantity of MDR-TB drugs ordered for 2013 matched the annual forecast and all central orders placed during the year were delivered in full and on time. Drug consumption was 81%-106% of the quantity allocated for routine consumption. Timely submission of complete inventory reports ranged from 86-100%, late submissions being 5-15 days late. Forty to 71% of treatment centres placed a drug order when stock was below the minimum level of three months. The proportion of drug orders received at the treatment centres in full and on time ranged from 29-80%, late orders being 1-19 days late. Conclusion The PSM was found to be performing well in terms of forecasting and procurement of MDR-TB drugs, but there were shortcomings in drug distribution, reporting at treatment centre level and in drug order placements. Despite these gaps, there were no stock outs. These findings indicate that where it matters most, namely ensuring that no drug stock outs affect patient management, the PSM system is effective. Addressing the observed shortcomings will help to strengthen the existing PSM system in anticipation of a growing MDR-TB case burden in the country.		
10.1186_s12889_015_1933_9	Prevalence and drug resistance profile of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from pulmonary tuberculosis patients attending two public hospitals in East Gojjam zone, northwest Ethiopia	Background: The spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains has become a challenge to the global TB control and prevention program. In Ethiopia, particularly in rural areas, information on drug-resistant TB is very limited. In this study, we determined the drug resistance patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) isolates from pulmonary TB patients attending two public hospitals in the East Gojjam zone of northwest Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between May 2011 and January 2012 using Region of difference-9 (RD9) typing for the identification of species mycobacterium. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) of M. tuberculosis isolates to the first-line drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin was performed by the indirect proportion method on Middle brook 7H10 Agar media. Results: Out of 385 pulmonary TB suspects studied, 124 (32.2 %) were culture positive among which 120 were M. tuberculosis strains. Susceptibility testing was performed for 89 isolates. Resistance to at least one drug was 15.58 % ([12/77], 95 % CI: 7.48-23.68) among newly diagnosed and 50.0 % ([6/12], 95 % CI: 21.71-78.29) among previously treated cases. Resistance among newly diagnosed patients was most common for streptomycin 5.19 % (4/77) and ethambutol 5.19 % (4/77) followed by rifampicin 3.89 % (3/77). Among retreatment cases, isoniazid resistance was most frequent in which 33.33 % (4/12) of the isolates were resistant. MDR prevalence was 1.29 % (1/77) for newly diagnosed and 16.67 % (2/12) for retreatment cases. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, age group of 25-34 years (adjusted OR = 4.24; 95 % CI: 1.02-17.5; P = 0.046) and previous history of treatment (adjusted OR = 5.42; 95 % CI: 1.56-27.49; P = 0.01) were independently associated with anti-TB drug resistance. Conclusions: In general, the magnitude of anti-TB drug resistance including MDR-TB was comparable to previous studies in other areas of Ethiopia. However, rifampicin resistance was high, which could suggest the potential for a rise in the incidence of MDR. Therefore, re-enforcing TB control programs should be considered by the concerned public health authorities.

10.1371_journal.pone.0124308	Mycobacterium tuberculosis Genotypes Determined by Spoligotyping to Be Circulating in Colombia between 1999 and 2012 and Their Possible Associations with Transmission and Susceptibility to First-Line Drugs	Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) remains a primary public health problem worldwide. The number of multi-drug- resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) cases has increased in recent years in Colombia. Knowledge of M. tuberculosis genotypes defined by spoligotyping can help determine the circulation of genotypes that must be controlled to prevent the spread of TB. Objective To describe the genotypes of M. tuberculosis using spoligotyping in resistant and drug-sensitive isolates and their possible associations with susceptibility to first-line drugs. Methods An analytical observational study was conducted that included 741 isolates of M. tuberculosis from patients. The isolates originated from 31 departments and were obtained by systematic surveillance between 1999 and 2012. Results In total 61.94% of the isolates were resistant to 1 or more drugs, and 147 isolates were MDR. In total, 170 genotypes were found in the population structure of Colombian M. tuberculosis isolates. The isolates were mainly represented by four families: LAM (39.9%), Haarlem (19%), Orphan (17%) and T (9%). The SIT42 (LAM 9) was the most common genotype and contained 24.7% of the isolates, followed by the genotypes SIT62 (Haarlem1), SIT53 (T1), and SIT50 (H3). A high clustering of isolates was evident with 79.8% of the isolates classified into 32 groups. The Beijing family was associated with resistant isolates, whereas the Haarlem and T families were associated with sensitive isolates. The Haarlem family was also associated with grouped isolates (p = 0.031). Conclusions A high proportion (approximately 80%) of isolates was found in clusters; these clusters were not associated with resistance to first-line drugs. The Beijing family was associated with drug resistance, whereas the T and Haarlem families were associated with susceptibility in the Colombian isolates studied.

10.1371_journal.pone.0129207	"Whole Genome Sequencing Investigation of a Tuberculosis Outbreak in Port-au-Prince, Haiti Caused by a Strain with a ""Low-Level"" rpoB Mutation L511P-Insights into a Mechanism of Resistance Escalation"	"The World Health Organization recommends diagnosing Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in high burden countries by detection of mutations in Rifampin (RIF) Resistance Determining Region of Mycobacterium tuberculosis rpoB gene with rapid molecular tests GeneXpert MTB/RIF and Hain MTBDRplus. Such mutations are found in >95% of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to RIF by conventional culture-based drug susceptibility testing (DST). However routine diagnostic screening with molecular tests uncovered specific ""low level"" rpoB mutations conferring resistance to RIF below the critical concentration of 1 mu g/ml in some phenotypically susceptible strains. Cases with discrepant phenotypic (susceptible) and genotypic (resistant) results for resistance to RIF account for at least 10% of resistant diagnoses by molecular tests and urgently require new guidelines to inform therapeutic decision making. Eight strains with a "" low level"" rpoB mutation L511P were isolated by GHESKIO laboratory between 2008 and 2012 from 6 HIV-negative and 2 HIV-positive patients during routine molecular testing. Five isolates with a single L511P mutation and two isolates with double mutation L511P&M515T had MICs for RIF between 0.125 and 0.5 mu g/ml and tested susceptible in culture-based DST. The eighth isolate carried a double mutation L511P&D516C and was phenotypically resistant to RIF. All eight strains shared the same spoligotype SIT 53 commonly found in Haiti but classic epidemiological investigation failed to uncover direct contacts between the patients. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) revealed that L511P cluster isolates resulted from a clonal expansion of an ancestral strain resistant to Isoniazid and to a very low level of RIF. Under the selective pressure of RIF-based therapy the strain acquired mutation in the M306 codon of embB followed by secondary mutations in rpoB and escalation of resistance level. This scenario highlights the importance of subcritical resistance to RIF for both clinical management of patients and public health and provides support for introducing rpoB mutations as proxy for MICs into laboratory diagnosis of RIF resistance. This study illustrates that WGS is a promising multipurpose genotyping tool for high-burden settings as it provides both ""gold standard"" sequencing results for prediction of drug susceptibility and a high-resolution data for epidemiological investigation in a single assay."

10.1089_mdr.2014.0094	Antibiotic Susceptibility Patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates from Guizhou Province of China Against 13 Antituberculosis Drugs	A total of 92 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were collected from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in the Zunyi region between 2011 and 2012. Collected isolates were used to determine antibiotic susceptibility patterns against 13 anti-TB drugs: 4 first-line and 9 second-line (ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, para-aminosalicylic acid, amikacin, capreomycin, kanamycin, and prothionamide) drugs. Results showed that among 57 new cases of TB only 66.7% were susceptible to all four first-line anti-TB drugs and 64.9% were susceptible to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectables; 10.5% of new and 22.9% of previously treated cases were multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB); and 1.8% of new and 2.9% of previously treated cases were extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). In addition, 14.3% of MDR-TB cases (2 out of 14) were XDR-TB, which is higher than the average numbers in China (about 8%) and in the world (9.6%). This study confirms that primary transmission of drug-resistant TB, including MDR/XDR-TB, is a real threat to achieving effective control of drug-resistant TB in the Guizhou Province and indicates the necessity to determine antibiotic susceptibility patterns in patients with TB to improve treatment outcomes.

10.1128_AAC.00379_15	Cavitary Penetration of Levofloxacin among Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	A better understanding of second-line drug (SLD) pharmacokinetics, including cavitary penetration, may help optimize SLD dosing. Patients with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) undergoing adjunctive surgery were enrolled in Tbilisi, Georgia. Serum was obtained at 0, 1, 4, and 8 h and at the time of cavitary removal to measure levofloxacin concentrations. After surgery, microdialysis was performed using the ex vivo cavity, and levofloxacin concentrations in the collected dialysate fluid were measured. Noncompartmental analysis was performed, and a cavitary-to-serum levofloxacin concentration ratio was calculated. Twelve patients received levofloxacin for a median of 373 days before surgery (median dose, 11.8 mg/kg). The median levofloxacin concentration in serum (C-max) was 6.5 mu g/ml, and it was <2 mu g/ml in 3 (25%) patients. Among 11 patients with complete data, the median cavitary concentration of levofloxacin was 4.36 mu g/ml (range, 0.46 to 8.82). The median cavitary/serum levofloxacin ratio was 1.33 (range, 0.63 to 2.36), and 7 patients (64%) had a ratio of >1. There was a significant correlation between serum and cavitary concentrations (r = 0.71; P = 0.01). Levofloxacin had excellent penetration into chronic cavitary TB lesions, and there was a good correlation between serum and cavitary concentrations. Optimizing serum concentrations will help ensure optimal cavitary concentrations of levofloxacin, which may enhance treatment outcomes.

10.1101_cshperspect.a021154	The Tuberculosis Drug Discovery and Development Pipeline and Emerging Drug Targets	The recent accelerated approval for use in extensively drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant-tuberculosis (MDR-TB) of two first-in-class TB drugs, bedaquiline and delamanid, has rein-vigorated the TB drug discovery and development field. However, although several promising clinical development programs are ongoing to evaluate new TB drugs and regimens, the number of novel series represented is few. The global early-development pipeline is also woefully thin. To have a chance of achieving the goal of better, shorter, safer TB drug regimens with utility against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant disease, a robust and diverse global TB drug discovery pipeline is key, including innovative approaches that make use of recently acquired knowledge on the biology of TB. Fortunately, drug discovery for TB has resurged in recent years, generating compounds with varying potential for progression into developable leads. In parallel, advances have been made in understanding TB pathogenesis. It is now possible to apply the lessons learned from recent TB hit generation efforts and newly validated TB drug targets to generate the next wave of TB drug leads. Use of currently underexploited sources of chemical matter and lead-optimization strategies may also improve the efficiency of future TB drug discovery. Novel TB drug regimens with shorter treatment durations must target all subpopulations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis existing in an infection, including those responsible for the protracted TB treatment duration. This review summarizes the current TB drug development pipeline and proposes strategies for generating improved hits and leads in the discovery phase that could help achieve this goal.

pub-0597	In silico modeling, design, synthesis and screening for antitubercular activity of some novel 1,2,4-triazole derivatives	The lead molecule - 1,2,4-triazolin-3-thiones was found to be a powerful novel anti-TB drug with high potency. Isoniazid, the first line drug for TB, will act on the enzyme InhA. An attempt was made to incorporate substituted 1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol nucleus to this, so that it will act by inhibiting sterol 14 alpha-demethylase P450 (CYP51). The lead molecule will be synthesized by conventional method. The products obtained will be characterized and percentage yield calculated. The purity of the compounds will be checked by melting point and R-f value in TLC. Structures of all synthesized compounds were confirmed by FTIR, H-1 NMR and mass spectral data. Molinspiration software was used for finding the c log P values and the antitubercular activity was studied. All the synthesized 1,2,4-triazole derivatives showed inhibitory activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv strains.	1,2,4-Triazoline-3-thione; antitubercular activity; MDR TB; Mycobacterium tuberculosis

An estimated 78,000 new cases of MDR-TB occur annually in the Region, of which approximately 10% are extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB. In response, the WHO Regional Office for Europe developed a Consolidated Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Multidrug-and Extensively Drug-resistant Tuberculosis (2011-2015). Our objective was to analyse the cost-effectiveness of implementing the plan, with the expected achievements of diagnosing 85% of estimated MDR-TB cases and treating at least 75% successfully. A transmission model, using epidemiological data reported to WHO was developed to calculate expected achievements. WHO-CHOICE database was used for cost analyses. The highly cost-effective plan is expected to prevent the emergence of 250,000 new MDR-TB and 13,000 XDR-TB patients respectively, saving US$7 billion and 120,000 lives. The plan and accompanying Resolution were fully endorsed by the sixty-first session of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe in 2011. Member States need to continuously improve health system performance and address TB determinants. Research and development of new medicines, tools and patient-friendly services are also crucial.

10.1016_j.cclet.2015.04.013	A highly efficient way to recycle inactive stereoisomers of Bedaquiline into two previous intermediates via base-catalyzed C-sp3-C-sp3 bond cleavage	Bedaquiline is a new medicine for pulmonary multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), which is a pure enantiomer with two chiral centers. The current industrial preparation process requires the separation of active Bedaquiline from a mixture of four isomers. Obviously, direct dispose of the other three undesired stereoisomers will cause significant waste and increase the unnecessary cost of production. Here, we developed an efficient, facile and scalable process for recycling the inactive stereoisomers of Bedaquiline. All these inactive stereoisomers could be recycled by their conversion to two important intermediates in the Bedaquiline synthesis via a base-catalyzed C-sp3-C-sp3 bond cleavage of a benzyl alcohol intermediate. And the precise conditions and mechanism of the base-catalyzed cleavage reaction were discussed.

10.1016_j.pupt.2014.04.006	Facing multi-drug resistant tuberculosis	Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to at least two of the most effective anti-tuberculosis drugs (i.e., isoniazid and rifampicin). Therapeutic regimens based on second- and third-line anti-tuberculosis medicines showed poor efficacy, safety, and tolerability profiles. It was estimated that in 2012 the multi-drug resistant tuberculosis incidence ranged from 300,000 to 500,000 cases, mainly diagnosed in the Eastern European and Central Asian countries. The highest proportion of cases is among individuals previously exposed to anti-tuberculosis drugs. Three main conditions can favour the emergence and spread of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis: the poor implementation of the DOTS strategy, the shortage or the poor quality of the anti-tuberculosis drugs, and the poor therapeutic adherence of the patients to the prescribed regimens. Consultation with tuberculosis experts (e.g., consilium) is crucial to tailor the best anti-tuberculosis therapy. New therapeutic options are necessary: bedaquiline and delamanid seem promising drugs; in particular, during the development phase they demonstrated a protective effect against the emergence of further resistances towards the backbone drugs. In the recent past, other antibiotics have been administered off-label: the most relevant efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile was proved in linezolid-, meropenem/clavulanate-, cotrimoxazole-containing regimens. New research and development activities are needed in the diagnostic, therapeutic, preventive fields. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

pub-0601	In Vitro Evaluation of Linezolid and Meropenem Against Clinical Isolates of Multi Drug Resistant Tuberculosis By Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960	Objective: To evaluate the in vitro effectiveness of multiple breakpoint concentrations of newer antituberculosis agents (Linezolid and Meropenem) against Multi Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates. Study Design: A descriptive cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: Microbiology Department, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP), Rawalpindi, from September 2011 to August 2013. Methodology: A total of 100 MDR-TB isolates recovered during the study period were subjected to susceptibility testing against multiple breakpoint concentrations of Linezolid (LZD) and Meropenem (MER). The breakpoint concentration used for LZD were 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mu g/ml, while for MER were 4.0, 8.0 and 16 mu g/ml. Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960 system was used to carry out drug susceptibility testing as per recommended protocol. Results: At break point concentration of 0.5 mu g/ml, 80 out of 100 (80%) MDR-TB isolates were susceptible to LZD while at breakpoint concentration of 1.0 mu g/ml and 2.0 mu g/ml, 96/100, (96%) of MDR-TB isolates were susceptible. For MER, at breakpoint concentrations of 4.0 mu g/ml no MDR-TB isolate was susceptible, while at 8.0 mu g/ml 3/100, (3%) and at 16.0 mu g/ml 11/100, (11%) of MDR-TB isolates were susceptible. Conclusion: LZD was found to have excellent in vitro efficacy as 96% of MDR-TB isolates were susceptible at breakpoint concentration of 1.0 mu g/ml or more. In case of MER it was found that in vitro susceptibility improved as the break point concentrations were increased.

10.3201_eid2106.141329	Additional Drug Resistance of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Patients in 9 Countries	Data from a large multicenter observational study of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) were analyzed to simulate the possible use of 2 new approaches to treatment of MDR TB: a short (9-month) regimen and a bedaquiline-containing regimen. Of 1,254 patients, 952 (75.9%) had no resistance to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs and thus would qualify as candidates for the 9-month regimen; 302 (24.1%) patients with resistance to a fluoroquinolone or second-line injectable drug would qualify as candidates for a bedaquiline-containing regimen in accordance with published guidelines. Among candidates for the 9-month regimen, standardized drug-susceptibility tests demonstrated susceptibility to a median of 5 (interquartile range 5-6) drugs. Among candidates for bedaquiline, drug-susceptibility tests demonstrated susceptibility to a median of 3 (interquartile range 2-4) drugs; 26% retained susceptibility to <= 2 drugs. These data may assist national TB programs in planning to implement new drugs and drug regimens.		TREATMENT OUTCOMES; PNCA MUTATIONS; SURVEILLANCE; METAANALYSIS
10.3201_eid2106.141873	Acquired Drug Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Poor Outcomes among Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Rates and risk factors for acquired drug resistance and association with outcomes among patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) are not well defined. In an MDR TB cohort from the country of Georgia, drug susceptibility testing for second-line drugs (SLDs) was performed at baseline and every third month. Acquired resistance was defined as any SLD whose status changed from susceptible at baseline to resistant at follow-up. Among 141 patients, acquired resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis was observed in 19 (14%); prevalence was 9.1% for ofloxacin and 9.8% for capreomycin or kanamycin. Baseline cavitary disease and resistance to >= 6 drugs were associated with acquired resistance. Patients with M. tuberculosis that had acquired resistance were at significantly increased risk for poor treatment outcome compared with patients without these isolates (89% vs. 36%; p<0.01). Acquired resistance occurs commonly among patients with MDR TB and impedes successful treatment outcomes.		PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; METAANALYSIS; EMERGENCE; SURGERY
10.3201_eid2106.141907	Risk Factors for Acquisition of Drug Resistance during Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment, Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia, 2005-2010	Acquired resistance to antituberculosis drugs decreases effective treatment options and the likelihood of treatment success. We identified risk factors for acquisition of drug resistance during treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) and evaluated the effect on treatment outcomes. Data were collected prospectively from adults from Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia, who had pulmonary MDR TB during 2005-2008. Acquisition of resistance to capreomycin and of extensively drug-resistant TB were more likely among patients who received <3 effective drugs than among patients who received >= 3 effective drugs (9.4% vs. 0% and 8.6% vs. 0.8%, respectively). Poor outcomes were more likely among patients with acquired capreomycin resistance (100% vs. 25.9%), acquired ofloxacin resistance (83.6% vs. 22.7%), or acquired extensive drug resistance (100% vs. 24.4%). To prevent acquired drug resistance and poor outcomes, baseline susceptibility to first- and second-line drugs should be determined quickly, and treatment should be adjusted to contain >= 3 effective drugs.

10.1016_j.meegid.2015.03.038	Genotypic diversity of multidrug-, quinolone- and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in Thailand	Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), which includes multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB), quinolone-resistant (QR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), is a serious threat to TB control. We aimed to characterize the genotypic diversity of drug-resistant TB clinical isolates collected in Thailand to establish whether the emergence of drug-resistant TB is attributable to transmitted resistance or acquired resistance. We constructed the first molecular phylogeny of MDR-TB (n = 95), QR-TB (n = 69) and XDR-TB (n = 28) in Thailand based on spoligotyping and proposed 24-locus multilocus variable-number of tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). Clustering analysis was performed using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean. Spoligotyping identified the Beijing strain (SIT1) as the most predominant genotype (n = 139; 72.4%). The discriminatory power of 0.9235 Hunter-Gaston Discriminatory Index (HGDI) with the 15-locus variable-number tandem repeats of mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units typing was improved to a 0.9574 HGDI with proposed 24-locus MLVA, thereby resulting in the subdivision of a large cluster of Beijing strains (SIT1) into 17 subclusters. We identified the spread of drug-resistant TB clones caused by three different MLVA types in the Beijing strain (SIT1) and a specific clone of XDR-TB caused by a rare genotype, the Manu-ancestor strain (SIT523). Overall, 49.5% of all isolates were clustered. These findings suggest that a remarkable transmission of drug-resistant TB occurred in Thailand. The remaining 50% of drug-resistant TB isolates were unique genotypes, which may have arisen from the individual acquisition of drug resistance. Our results suggest that transmitted and acquired resistance have played an equal role in the emergence of drug-resistant TB. Further characterization of whole genome sequences of clonal strains could help to elucidate the mycobacterial genetic factors relevant for drug resistance, transmissibility and virulence.

10.5588_ijtld.14.0879	Epidemiology of drug-resistant tuberculosis among children and adolescents in South Africa, 2005-2010	OBJECTIVE: To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of children and adolescents diagnosed with resistance to any anti-tuberculosis drug (drug-resistant tuberculosis; DR-TB) in South Africa. DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of all children (<13 years) and adolescents (13 to <18 years) with DR-TB at specialty hospitals in four South African provinces from 2005 to 2010. RESULTS: During the review period, 774 children and adolescents (median age 11.3 years) were diagnosed with DR-TB at selected facilities. A high proportion of patients had a history of previous TB treatment (285/631; 45.2%), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (375/685; 54.7%), contact with a TB case (347/454; 76.4%), and smear-positive (443/729; 60.8%), cavitary (253/680, 38.7%) disease. Eighty-two per cent of patients with HIV infection received antiretroviral therapy. Of 626 patients diagnosed with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), 561 (89.6%) received a regimen consistent with national guidelines; the median length of treatment was 22 months (IQR 16-25). Among 400 patients with any DR-TB and a known outcome, 20.3% died during treatment. CONCLUSION: Pediatric DR-113 in these provinces is characterized by complex clinical features at diagnosis, with one in five children dying during treatment. History of previous treatment and contact with a TB patient indicate opportunities for earlier diagnosis and treatment to improve outcomes.

10.5588_ijtld.14.0785	The Fourth National Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance Survey in Viet Nam	SETTING: Viet Nam's Fourth National Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance Survey was conducted in 2011. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of resistance to the four main first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs in Viet Nam. METHODS: Eighty clusters were selected using a probability proportion to size approach. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) against the four main first-line antituberculosis drugs was performed. RESULTS: A total of 1629 smear-positive tuberculosis (TB) patients were eligible for culture. Of these, DST results were available for 1312 patients, including 1105 new TB cases, 195 previously treated TB cases and 12 cases with an unknown treatment history. The proportion of cases with resistance to any drug was 32.7% (95%CI 29.1-36.5) among new cases and 54.2% (95 %CI 44.3-63.7) among previously treated cases. The proportion of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases was 4.0% (95%CI 2.5-5.4) in new cases and 23.3 (95%CI 16.7-29.9) in previously treated cases. CONCLUSIONS: The fourth drug resistance survey in Viet Nam found that the proportion of MDR-TB among new and previously treated cases was not significantly different from that in the 2005 survey. The National TB Programme should prioritise the detection and treatment of MDR-TB to reduce transmission of MDR-TB in the community.

10.5588_ijtld.14.0768	Pyrazinamide resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis arises after rifampicin and fluoroquinolone resistance	BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) constitute a major public health concern. OBJECTIVE: To determine the timing of pncA mutations that confer pyrazinamide (PZA) resistance in relation to mutations conferring resistance to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP). DESIGN: Isolates from two major urban centres Paris (101 strains) and Shanghai (171 strains) were investigated for the association of pncA mutations with resistance to drugs other than PZA. RESULTS: The proportion of pncA mutations found in INH-monoresistant strains was not increased. CONCLUSION: pncA mutations associated with PZA resistance were found almost exclusively in MDR-TB strains, underlining the importance of determining PZA resistance when treating MDR- or XDR-TB.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; pyrazinamide	PNCA GENE; SUSCEPTIBILITY; IDENTIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; CHINA
10.5588_ijtld.14.0811	Diabetes mellitus is associated with cavities, smear grade, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Georgia	SETTING: National tuberculosis (TB) treatment facility in the country of Georgia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and pre-DM among patients with TB using glycosylated-hemoglobin (HbA1c), and to estimate the association between DM and clinical characteristics and response to anti-tuberculosis treatment. DESIGN: A cohort study was conducted from 2011 to 2014 at the National Centre for TB and Lung Disease in Tbilisi. Patients aged >= 35 years with pulmonary TB were included. HbA1c was used to define DM (>= 6.5%), pre-DM (>= 5.7-6.4%), and no DM (<5.7%). Interviews and medical chart abstraction were performed. Regression analyses estimated associations between DM and 1) baseline TB characteristics and 2) anti-tuberculosis treatment outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 318 newly diagnosed patients with TB were enrolled. The prevalence of DM and pre-DM was 11.6% and 16.4%, respectively. In multivariable analyses, patients with TB-DM had more cavitation (adjusted OR [aOR] 2.26), higher smear grade (aOR 2.37), and more multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) (aOR 2.27) than patients without DM. The risk of poor anti-tuberculosis treatment outcomes was similar among patients with and those without DM (28.1% vs. 23.6%). CONCLUSION: DM and pre-DM were common among adults with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB in Tbilisi, Georgia, and DM was associated with more clinical symptoms, and MDR-TB, at presentation.	hyperglycemia; hemoglobin A1c; treatment failure; epidemiology	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; IMPACT; MANIFESTATIONS; BURDEN; SPUTUM; RISK
10.1371_journal.pone.0128298	Association between Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis and Risk Factors in China: Applying Partial Least Squares Path Modeling	Background Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) resulting from various factors has raised serious public health concerns worldwide. Identifying the ecological risk factors associated with MDR-TB is critical to its prevention and control. This study aimed to explore the association between the development of MDR-TB and the risk factors at the group-level (ecological risk factors) in China. Methods Data on MDR-TB in 120 counties were obtained from the National Tuberculosis Information Management System, and data on risk-factor variables were extracted from the Health Statistical Yearbook, provincial databases, and the meteorological bureau of each province (municipality). Partial Least Square Path Modeling was used to detect the associations. Results The median proportion of MDR-TB in new TB cases was 3.96% (range, 0-39.39%). Six latent factors were extracted from the ecological risk factors, which explained 27.60% of the total variance overall in the prevalence of MDR-TB. Based on the results of PLS-PM, TB prevention, health resources, health services, TB treatment, TB detection, geography and climate factors were all associated with the risk of MDR-TB, but socioeconomic factors were not significant. Conclusions The development of MDR-TB was influenced by TB prevention, health resources, health services, TB treatment, TB detection, geography and climate factors. Such information may help us to establish appropriate public health intervention strategies to prevent and control MDR-TB and yield benefits to the entire public health system in China.

10.1371_journal.pone.0127536	Direct Detection by the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay and Characterization of Multi and Poly Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa	Background This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the rapid direct detection of M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains and rifampicin resistance associated mutations in a resource-limited setting such as Guinea-Bissau and its implications in the management of tuberculosis (TB) and drug resistant tuberculosis, complementing the scarce information on resistance and genotypic diversity of MTBC strains in this West African country. Methods and Results This cross-sectional prospective study included 100 consecutive TB patients with positive acid-fast smears at two months of anti-tuberculosis treatment or in a re-treatment situation, between May and December 2012. Resistance to rifampicin was detected using the Gen-eXpert system and the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. MTBC isolates obtained with the BACTEC MGIT 960 system were tested for susceptibility to first- and second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. Overall, the prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) was found to be 9 cases. Of these, 67% (6 patients) of confirmed MDR-TB cases had no past history of TB treatment and 33% (3 patients) were previously treated cases. Extensively drug-resistant TB was not found. Molecular typing of the MDR-TB strains revealed recent transmission patterns of imported MDR strains. Conclusions The Xpert MTB/RIF assay was reliable for the detection of rifampicin resistant MTBC strains directly from sputum samples of patients undergoing first-line treatment for two months, being more trustworthy than the simple presence of acid-fast bacilli in the smear. Its implementation is technically simple, does not require specialized laboratory infrastructures and is suitable for resource-limited settings when a regular source of electricity and maintenance is available as well as financial and operation sustainability is guaranteed by the health authorities. A high prevalence of MDR-TB among patients at risk of MDR-TB after two months of first-line treatment was found, in support of the WHO recommendations for its use in the management of this risk group.

pub-0612	Correlations between Drug Resistance of Beijing/W Lineage Clinical Isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Sublineages: A 2009-2013 Prospective Study in Xinjiang Province, China	Background: The prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in Xinjiang is higher than in other regions of China, and Beijing/W lineage Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is the dominant strain of MTB in Xinjiang. However, information on multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB, particularly the correlation between MDR and the Beijing/W lineage and the correlation between drug resistance and the Beijing/W sublineage strains, is limited. Material/Methods: We conducted a prospective study to describe the prevalence of MDR/XDR TB, Beijing/W lineage and sublineage strains in Xinjiang in China from 2009 to 2013. All MTB underwent drug susceptibility testing to the first-and second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. The Beijing/W lineages and sublineages were detected by large-sequence polymorphisms with polymerase chain reaction. Results: A total of 410 clinical isolates were identified. The overall percentage of MDR and XDR cases in Xinjiang was 13.2% (54/410) and 13.0% (7/54), respectively. Overall, 9.8% (14/143) of the Beijing lineage MTB were MDR patients, and 15.6% (40/257) of the Non-Beijing lineage MTB were MDR patients. In the 143 Beijing MTB lineages, 11.2% isolates were in sublineage 105, 15.4% isolates were in sublineage 207, 69.2% isolates were in sublineage 181, and 4.2% isolates were in sublineage 150. None of the isolates were detected in sublineage 142. Significant differences between the Beijing/W and non-Beijing/W strains were observed regarding INH and EMB resistance, respectively. Conclusions: The prevalence of the MDR TB in Xinjiang remains high and imposes challenges for TB control. Four Beijing/W sublineage isolates were observed in Xinjiang. There was no correlation between MDR and the Beijing/W lineage and no correlation between drug resistance and the Beijing/W sublineage strains. Surveillance of the clinical isolates of MTB is recommended to strengthen the identification of MDR/XDR TB and sublineages of the Beijing/W strains.

10.1371_journal.pone.0126267	Integrating Community-Based Interventions to Reverse the Convergent TB/HIV Epidemics in Rural South Africa	The WHO recommends integrating interventions to address the devastating TB/HIV co-epidemics in South Africa, yet integration has been poorly implemented and TB/HIV control efforts need strengthening. Identifying infected individuals is particularly difficult in rural settings. We used mathematical modeling to predict the impact of community-based, integrated TB/HIV case finding and additional control strategies on South Africa's TB/HIV epidemics. We developed a model incorporating TB and HIV transmission to evaluate the effectiveness of integrating TB and HIV interventions in rural South Africa over 10 years. We modeled the impact of a novel screening program that integrates case finding for TB and HIV in the community, comparing it to status quo and recommended TB/HIV control strategies, including GeneXpert, MDR-TB treatment decentralization, improved first-line TB treatment cure rate, isoniazid preventive therapy, and expanded ART. Combining recommended interventions averted 27% of expected TB cases (95% CI 18-40%) 18% HIV (95% CI 13-24%), 60% MDR-TB (95% CI 34-83%), 69% XDR-TB (95% CI 34-90%), and 16% TB/HIV deaths (95% CI 12-29). Supplementing these interventions with annual community-based TB/HIV case finding averted a further 17% of TB cases (44% total; 95% CI 31-56%), 5% HIV (23% total; 95% CI 17-29%), 8% MDR-TB (68% total; 95% CI 40-88%), 4% XDR-TB (73% total; 95% CI 38-91%), and 8% TB/HIV deaths (24% total; 95% CI 16-39%). In addition to increasing screening frequency, we found that improving TB symptom questionnaire sensitivity, second-line TB treatment delays, default before initiating TB treatment or ART, and second-line TB drug efficacy were significantly associated with even greater reductions in TB and HIV cases. TB/HIV epidemics in South Africa were most effectively curtailed by simultaneously implementing interventions that integrated community-based TB/HIV control strategies and targeted drug-resistant TB. Strengthening existing TB and HIV treatment programs is needed to further reduce disease incidence.

pub-0614	Situation of drug resistant tuberculosis in Saharia tribe of central India	Background & objectives: The information on multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) situation amongst Saharia, one of the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in Madhya Pradesh, India, is not available. Hence, this study was undertaken to find the situation of MDR-TB amongst Saharia PVTG in two districts of Madhya Pradesh. Methods: Community based cross-sectional TB prevalence surveys were conducted among Saharia PVTG in Gwalior and Shivpuri districts of Madhya Pradesh. Chest symptomatics were identified from the individual registered for the study. Two sputum samples were collected from each of the eligible individuals, transported to the laboratory, and were examined by Ziehl-Neelsen (Z-N) smear microscopy and solid medium culture methods. Drug susceptibility testing of the isolates was done by indirect proportion method on solid medium. Results: MDR rate was 2.2 per cent of new cases and 8.2 per cent among the previously treated cases of TB in Gwalior while it was two per cent among the previously treated cases in Shivpuri district. Interpretation & conclusions: Though the prevalence of tuberculosis in these districts was alarmingly high, the MDR rates were more or less similar to national average. However, the findings of this study highlight the need for active intervention so that the MDR-TB is kept under control.

10.3390_molecules20058072	Antimycobacterial and Anti-Inflammatory Activities of Substituted Chalcones Focusing on an Anti-Tuberculosis Dual Treatment Approach	Tuberculosis (TB) remains a serious public health problem aggravated by the emergence of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) strains resistant to multiple drugs (MDR). Delay in TB treatment, common in the MDR-TB cases, can lead to deleterious life-threatening inflammation in susceptible hyper-reactive individuals, encouraging the discovery of new anti-Mtb drugs and the use of adjunctive therapy based on anti-inflammatory interventions. In this study, a series of forty synthetic chalcones was evaluated in vitro for their anti-inflammatory and antimycobacterial properties and in silico for pharmacokinetic parameters. Seven compounds strongly inhibited NO and PGE(2) production by LPS-stimulated macrophages through the specific inhibition of iNOS and COX-2 expression, respectively, with compounds 4 and 5 standing out in this respect. Four of the seven most active compounds were able to inhibit production of TNF- and IL-1. Chalcones that were not toxic to cultured macrophages were tested for antimycobacterial activity. Eight compounds were able to inhibit growth of the M. bovis BCG and Mtb H37Rv strains in bacterial cultures and in infected macrophages. Four of them, including compounds 4 and 5, were active against a hypervirulent clinical Mtb isolate as well. In silico analysis of ADMET properties showed that the evaluated chalcones displayed satisfactory pharmacokinetic parameters. In conclusion, the obtained data demonstrate that at least two of the studied chalcones, compounds 4 and 5, are promising antimycobacterial and anti-inflammatory agents, especially focusing on an anti-tuberculosis dual treatment approach.	tuberculosis; Mycobacterium; inflammation; chalcone	NITRIC-OXIDE PRODUCTION; RAW 264.7 MACROPHAGES; INHIBITORY-ACTIVITY; DERIVATIVES; INFLAMMATION; TUBERCULOSIS; CYTOKINES; ANALOGS; AGENTS
10.1093_trstmh_trv025	Predictors of cure among HIV co-infected multidrug-resistant TB patients at Sizwe Tropical Disease Hospital Johannesburg, South Africa	Background: The global incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is rising, especially among HIV infected patients, despite intervention programs. Limited data are available on outcomes of MDR-TB treatment, specifically in a cohort of HIV co-infected patients in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this study was to determine the predictors of cure among MDR-TB HIV co-infected patients. Methods: A retrospective review of 1200 medical records of HIV co-infected MDR-TB patients was performed at Sizwe Tropical Disease Hospital, Johannesburg covering the period 2007 to 2010. Logistic regression analysis was done to identify predictors of cure. Results: Of 1137 patients included in the analysis, 29.8% (339/1137) were cured, 16.5% (188/1137) completed treatment, 22.3% (254/1137) defaulted treatment, 2.9% (33/1137) failed treatment and 22.7% (258/1137) died while on treatment. The remaining 5.7% (65/1137) were transferred-out or still-on-treatment. There was a significant interaction between sex and timing of antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation (p=0.008). Factors predicting cure were male patients on ART prior to commencing MDR-TB treatment (OR 1.87, [1.11-3.13]), CD4(+) cell counts between 201-349 (OR 2.06, [1.10-3.84]) and >= 350 cells/mmA(3) (OR 1.98, [0.98-3.97]). Negative predictors of cure included the presence of cavitary lesions on chest x-rays (OR 0.55, [0.38-0.78]) and modified individualised regimen at baseline (OR 0.62, [0.42-0.92]). Conclusions: Cure was higher in males on ART prior to initiating MDR-TB treatment compared with males on ART after initiating MDR-TB treatment. The inverse was the case among females. Therefore, future research should explore the biological and behavioural mechanisms that may possibly be responsible for this observed trend. This will help improve MDR-TB treatment outcomes in HIV co-infected patients on ART.

pub-0617	Extensively and Pre-Extensively Drug Resistant Tuberculosis in Clinical Isolates of Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis Using Classical Second Line Drugs (Levofloxacin and Amikacin)	Objective: To find out the frequency of Extensively Drug Resistant (XDR) and pre-XDR tuberculosis in clinical isolates of Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) Tuberculosis (TB) by determining the susceptibilities against Levofloxacin and Amikacin (classical second line antituberculosis drugs). Study Design: A descriptive cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: Microbiology Department, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP), Rawalpindi, from September 2011 to August 2013. Methodology: Amikacin (AK) and Levofloxacin (LEVO) were obtained in chemically pure form from Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany). The breakpoint concentration used for AK was 1.0 mu g/ml and for LEVO 2.0 mu g/ml. Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960 system was used to carry out drug susceptibility testing as per recommended protocol. Results: A total of 3 MDR-TB isolates (3%) turned out to be XDR-TB based upon simultaneous resistance to injectable second line antituberculosis drug AK and one of the fluoro-quinolones (LEVO). A total of 24 MDR-TB isolates (24%) were found to be pre-XDR based upon resistance to LEVO alone. Treatment status record of patients with XDR and pre-XDR-TB isolates revealed that majority of patients had received fluoroquinolones (FQs) during the course of treatment. Conclusion: XDR-TB has started to emerge in MDR-TB isolates in our set up. The worrying sign is the high frequency of pre-XDR tuberculosis. Urgent steps need to be taken to stem the tide of pre-XDR-TB in our population. It is thus recommended to develop facilities to carry out drug susceptibility testing to monitor the status of pre-XDR and XDR-TB in our population.

10.3904_kjim.2015.30.3.325	Drug-resistance pattern of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains from patients with pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis during 2006 to 2013 in a Korean tertiary medical center	Background/Aims: We evaluated the trend in the rates of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) over time, as well as the difference in the drug-resistance pattern between pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) at a private referral center in South Korea. Methods: All patients with culture-confirmed TB from 2006 to 2013 were included. Results: In total, 1,745 patients were included: 1,431 (82.0%) were new cases, and 314 (18.0%) were cases treated previously; 1,610 (92.3%) were diagnosed with PTB, and 135 (7.7%) were diagnosed with EPTB. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB were detected in 5.8% and 2.0% of new cases and in 20.1% and 8.6% of previously treated cases, respectively. The MDR TB rate during the study period decreased remarkably, whereas the MDR and XDR TB rates decreased significantly in previously treated cases. No difference in the drug-resistance rate was detected between PTB and EPTB. Conclusions: The TB drug-resistance rate, particularly that of MDR TB, remained high at a private referral hospital, and the drug-resistance rate did not decrease significantly from 2006 to 2013. This finding underscores the need for a national survey regarding the prevalence of drug-resistant TB to obtain the most accurate and current drug-resistance status in South Korea, including the private sector.		
10.1016_j.rmed.2015.01.017	Cost effectiveness of treating multi-drug resistant tuberculosis by adding Deltyba(TM) to background regimens in Germany	Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of adding delamanid (Deltyba(TM)) to a background regimen (BR) for treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Germany. Methods: The incremental cost-effectiveness of treating a cohort of MDR-TB patients, 38-years old on average, with Deltyba(TM) plus BR versus a five drug- BR regimen alone was compared in a Markov model over a period of 10 years. Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) were determined from a societal perspective. Recent data from a German cost calculation on MDR-TB were applied to the 24-month outcome results of patients participating in the placebo-controlled, phase II Otsuka's Trial 204. Costs and effectiveness were discounted at a rate of 3% and subjected to deterministic as well as probabilistic sensitivity analysis in a Monte Carlo simulation. Results: Based on the current market prices the total discounted cost per patient on BR plus Deltyba(TM) was 142,732 compared to 150,909 for BR alone. The total discounted QALYs per patient were 8.47 for Deltyba(TM) versus 6.13 for BR alone. Accordingly, the addition of Deltyba(TM) proved to be dominant over the BR alone-strategy by simultaneously saving 8177 and gaining 2.34 QALYs. Deltyba(TM) was cost saving in 73% of probabilistic sensitivity analyses compared to BR alone and 100% cost effective at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of (sic)10,000. Conclusions: Under conditions prevalent in Germany, DeltybaTM added to a five drug BR regimen is likely to be cost-saving compared to BR alone under a wide range of assumptions. Adding delamanid remained cost-effective when costs due to loss of productivity were excluded as the QALYs gained by lower lethality and a higher proportion of successfully treated	Cost effectivenes analysis; Monte Carlo; simulation; Tuberculosis; MDR-TB	HEALTH
10.1016_j.tube.2015.02.041	Prevalence of drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis among children in China	The available data on the epidemic of drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) among children in China is limited. This study attempted to clarify the drug resistance profiles of clinical strains isolated from children and estimate risk factors related to acquisition of drug resistance. All Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains from children (age < 15 years) and adolescent (age 15-18 years) TB patients received in the strain library of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention between January 2005 and December 2012 were included in the study. A study collection included 450 clinical isolates (100 from children, 159 from adolescents, and 191 from adults) from all over China. Drug susceptibility testing was performed by a proportion method. As a result, the drug resistance and multi-drug resistance (MDR) rates in children were 55% (55/100) and 22% (22/100), respectively. In children with MDR-TB, new cases accounted for 40.9% (9/22). Compared with adults, the drug resistance rates were similar in all subgroups (new cases, previously treated cases and all cases) of children (P > 0.05), except for the lower resistance rate to isoniazid in total cases of children (P = 0.011). Patient related information was included in the MDR-TB association analysis. The treatment history was found to be strongly associated with MDR-TB in all three age groups (P < 0.05). Our results demonstrate that the prevalence of drug resistant TB in children in China is alarmingly high and similar to that seen in adults. In contrast, in adolescents, the drug resistance rate to most tested drugs was lower than in adults. Primary transmission and inadequate treatment are two equally important factors for the high MDR-TB rate in children. Thus, major efforts in the TB control in children should focus on decreasing the transmission of drug resistant TB and early testing of drug resistance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.5588_ijtld.14.0535	High effectiveness of a 12-month regimen for MDR-TB patients in Cameroon	SETTING: Two specialised multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment units in Cameroon. OBJECTIVE: To assess outcome and adverse drug events with a standardised 12-month regimen for MDR-TB among second-line drug naive patients. DESIGN: Prospective observational study of MDR-TB patients treated with a standardised 12-month regimen including gatifloxacin, clofazimine, prothionamide, ethambutol and pyrazinamidc throughout, supplemented by kanamycin and isoniazid during an intensive phase of a minimum of 4 months. Progress was monitored monthly until treatment completion and twice over one year after treatment cessation. RESULTS: Eighty-seven potentially eligible patients were lost and never treated due to delayed availability of test results. Among the 150/236 eligible and treated patients, 134 (89%) successfully completed treatment, 10 died, 5 were lost, 1 failed and none relapsed. The patients' mean age was 33.7 years (range 17-68), 73 (49%) were females, 120 (80%) had failed on previous treatment, 30 (20%) were human immunodeficiency virus seropositive, 62 (43%) had a body mass index <18.5 kg/m(2) and 41 (27%) had radiographic involvement of five or six of the six lung zones. The most important adverse drug event was hearing impairment, which occurred in 46 of 106 (43%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results add further evidence for the usefulness of shorter, standardised regimens among patients without second-line drug resistance.	tuberculosis; multidrug resistance; treatment; short-course; Cameroon	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; DEFINITIONS
10.5588_ijtld.14.0739	Changes in treatment outcomes of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: After several changes in treatment modalities, it is time to re-evaluate treatment outcomes of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate treatment outcomes, elucidate changes in outcomes over time and identify predictors of treatment success for MDR-TB. DESIGN: Patients diagnosed with MDR-TB at a tertiary referral centre in South Korea between January 2006 and December 2010 were included. Treatment modalities and outcomes were assessed. Predictors of treatment success were analysed using multiple logistic regression. The treatment modalities and outcomes of these patients were compared with those of MDR-TB patients between January 1996 and December 2005. RESULTS: Of the 123 MDR-TB patients diagnosed during the later study period, treatment was successful in 103 (83.7%). Extensive drug resistance (OR 0.31, P = 0.044) and additional resistance to fluoroquinolones (OR 0.23, P = 0.039) were inversely associated with treatment success. The treatment success rate improved from 53.5% in 1996-2000 to 68.8% in 2001-2005 and 83.7% in 2006-2010 (P < 0.001). Improved outcomes were accompanied with more frequent use of later-generation fluoroquinolones and linczolid and less frequent surgical resection. CONCLUSION: Treatment outcomes for MDR-TB improved at a tertiary referral centre in South Korea. The improvement was associated with more frequent use of later-generation fluoroquinolones and linczolid.	fluoroquinolone; linezolid; surgery	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; INJECTABLE DRUGS; MDR-TB; METAANALYSIS; IMPACT; LEVOFLOXACIN
10.5588_ijtld.14.0291	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the Amazonas State, Brazil, 2000-2011	SETTINGS: Amazonas is facing increasing challenges in tuberculosis (TB) control, with nearly 3000 cases per year, and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) may jeopardise the TB control programme. OBJECTIVE: To assess the number of MDR-TB cases in the Amazonas and to improve estimates of the burden of TB. DESIGNS: The Brazilian National Mandatory Disease Reporting System (SINAN) and the Brazilian Epidemiological Surveillance System of Multidrug Resistance (TBMR) were searched for MDR-TB cases in the State of Amazonas from 2000 to 2011. RESULTS: Eighty-one MDR-TB cases were notified. The rates of primary MDR-TB, initial MDR-TB during the first treatment regimen and acquired MDR-TB were respectively 3.8%, 13.7% and 82.7%; 26.9% of previously treated patients had >= 4 treatment cycles. The MDR-TB cases reported 263 contacts, only 35.0% of whom were examined. The cure and death rates among the 81 patients with MDR-TB were respectively 45.7% and 25.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The number of MDR-TB cases seems incompatible with the high TB prevalence in the Amazonas. Most patients were unaware of contact with TB patients. TB is endemic in the Amazonas. This highlights the need for improving resistance investigation among all TB cases.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; Amazonas	DRUG-RESISTANCE; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; METAANALYSIS
10.1016_j.ejim.2015.03.001	"Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis"" may be nontuberculous mycobacteria"	Introduction: Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) presents a great challenge to public health, especially for developing countries. Some nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) cause the similar clinical and radiological characteristics with tuberculosis. We aimed to identify the frequency of NTM infections among subjects who were suspected to have MDR-TB due to lack of response to anti-TB treatment. Methods: This retrospective study evaluated patients with suspected MDR-TB due to lack of sputum conversion after 2-3 month therapy with first line anti-TB treatment from 2009 through 2014. Cultures for mycobacteria were performed and identification was done to species level by phenotypic and molecular tests. The outcome of the patients with NTM disease and related risk factors for poor outcome were evaluated. Results: Out of 117 consecutive strains isolated from suspected MDR-TB subjects, 35 (30%) strains were identified as NTM by using conventional and molecular approaches. Of these patients with positive NTM cultures, 32 (27%) patients met ATS/IDSA diagnostic criteria. Out of 32, 29 (90%) individuals with confirmed NTM diseases had underlying disorders including 8 subjects with malignancy, 5 with organ transplantations, and 4 with the human immunodeficiency virus. No known underlying disorder was found in 3 (9%) subjects. Treatment outcomes were available for 27 subjects, 17 (63%) of whom were cured and 10 (37%) had poor outcome including 6 (60%) who failed and 4 (40%) who died during treatment. Conclusion: The high costs to the patient and society should lead health care providers to consider NTM in all patients suspected of having TB. (C) 2015 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

10.1017_ice.2015.5	Determinants of Tuberculosis Infection Control-Related Behaviors Among Healthcare Workers in the Country of Georgia	OBJECTIVE. To better understand tuberculosis (TB) infection control (IC) in healthcare facilities (HCFs) in Georgia. DESIGN. A cross-sectional evaluation of healthcare worker (HCW) knowledge, beliefs and behaviors toward TB IC measures including latent TB infection (LTBI) screening and treatment of HCWs. SETTING. Georgia, a high-burden multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) country. PARTICIPANTS. HCWs from the National TB Program and affiliated HCFs. METHODS. An anonymous self-administered 55-question survey developed based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) conceptual framework. RESULTS. In total, 240 HCWs (48% physicians; 39% nurses) completed the survey. The overall average TB knowledge score was 61%. Only 60% of HCWs reported frequent use of respirators when in contact with TB patients. Only 52% of HCWs were willing to undergo annual LTBI screening; 48% were willing to undergo LTBI treatment. In multivariate analysis, HCWs who worried about acquiring MDR-TB infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-2.25), who thought screening contacts of TB cases is important (aOR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.35-8.65), and who were physicians (aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.08-2.60) were more likely to accept annual LTBI screening. With regard to LTBI treatment, HCWs who worked in an outpatient TB facility (aOR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.11-0.58) or perceived a high personal risk of TB reinfection (aOR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.37-0.64) were less likely to accept LTBI treatment. CONCLUSION. The concern about TB reinfection is a major barrier to HCW acceptance of LTBI treatment. TB IC measures must be strengthened in parallel with or prior to the introduction of LTBI screening and treatment of HCWs.		LIKERT SCALE; BELIEF MODEL; FOLLOW-UP; METAANALYSIS; ATTITUDE
10.1016_j.puhe.2015.01.022	Tuberculosis report among injection drug users and their partners in Kazakhstan	Objectives: Tuberculosis (TB) is a major threat to global public health. Kazakhstan has the second highest percentage of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases among incident tuberculosis cases in the world (WHO 2013). A high burden of MDR-TB suggests TB prevention, control, and treatment programs are failing. This study provides an epidemiologic profile of TB among injection drug users (IDUs), a high-risk and chronically under-served population, in Kazakhstan. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: The authors studied the characteristics and risk environment of IDUs with self-reported previous active TB and their primary sexual partners in Almaty, Kazakhstan. 728 individuals (364 couples) participated in a couple-based study in 2009. Results: 16.75% of participants reported at least one positive TB test (x-ray) in their lifetime. In a multivariable logistic regression adjusting for couple-based sampling, persons with positive TB test were significantly more likely to be older (odds ratio (OR) 7.26, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.73, 30.43), male (OR 5.53, 95% CI: 2.74, 11.16), have a shorter duration of injection drug use (OR 0.17, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.65), have received high social support from their significant other (OR 2.13, 95% CI: 1.03, 4.40) and more likely (non-significantly) to have been incarcerated (OR 7.03, 95% CI: 0.64, 77.30). Conclusions: Older men with a history of incarceration and recent injection drug use were more likely to have positive TB test in Kazakhstan. Social network support, while potentially positive for many aspects of population health, may increase risk of TB among IDUs in this context. Public health policies that target high-risk populations and their at-risk networks may be necessary to stem the rise of MDR-TB in Central Asia. (C) 2015 The Royal Society for Public Health.

10.1126_sciadv.1500106	Structure of the mycobacterial ATP synthase Fo rotor ring in complex with the anti-TB drug bedaquiline	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is more prevalent today than at any other time in human history. Bedaquiline (BDQ), a novel Mycobacterium-specific adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase inhibitor, is the first drug in the last 40 years to be approved for the treatment of MDR-TB. This bactericidal compound targets the membrane-embedded rotor (c-ring) of the mycobacterial ATP synthase, a key metabolic enzyme required for ATP generation. We report the x-ray crystal structures of a mycobacterial c9 ring without and with BDQ bound at 1.55- and 1.7-A degrees resolution, respectively. The structures and supporting functional assays reveal how BDQ specifically interacts with the rotor ring via numerous interactions and thereby completely covers the c-ring's ionbinding sites. This prevents the rotor ring from acting as an ion shuttle and stalls ATP synthase operation. The structures explain how diarylquinoline chemicals specifically inhibit the mycobacterial ATP synthase and thus enable structure-based drug design of next-generation ATP synthase inhibitors against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other bacterial pathogens.		
10.1371_journal.pone.0126099	Good Quality Locally Procured Drugs Can Be as Effective as Internationally Quality Assured Drugs in Treating Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis	Background Owing toGiven the high costs of drugs to treat multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), the Green Light Committee (GLC) initiative enables TB programs to procure quality-assured drugs at reduced prices. Despite price reductions, internationally quality assured (IQA) drugs can be more expensive than locally procured drugs. There is little evidence to inform decision-makers about whether IQA drugs are more effective than local drugs. This is the first study to compare outcomes between MDR-TB patients treated using IQA, and locally procured drugs in the same hospitals during the same time period. Methods/Findings A retrospective cohort study was conducted in three hospitals across Pakistan. Data on baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes during the first six months of treatment were extracted from hospital records of adult culture-positive pulmonary MDR-TB patients starting treatment between January 2011 and June 2012. Two cohorts were defined: patients receiving IQA drugs, and patients receiving locally procured non-IQA drugs. Data were analysed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression. The primary outcome compared between cohorts was time to culture conversion. Of 231 patients, 90 were in the IQA and 141 in the non-IQA cohorts. Baseline characteristics were similar except for higher frequency of quinolone resistance in the IQA cohort. Overall, 193 patients (84%) culture converted. Culture conversion was not faster in the IQA cohort; the median time was 81 and 68 days in the IQA and non-IQA cohorts, respectively. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios for culture conversion in IQA verses non-IQA cohorts were 0.82 (95%-CI, 0.62-1.10) and 0.95 (95%-CI, 0.66-1.36) respectively. Conclusions Use of good quality, locally procured drugs can be effective in treating MDR-TB, may involve lower costs than using IQA drugs and could strengthen developing country drug quality assurance systems. This may be a suitable alternative in lieu of or whilst awaiting arrival of internationally procured medicines.

10.1371_journal.pone.0123655	High Frequency of Resistance, Lack of Clinical Benefit, and Poor Outcomes in Capreomycin Treated South African Patients with Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Background There are limited data about the epidemiology and treatment-related outcomes associated with capreomycin resistance in patients with XDR-TB. Capreomycin achieves high serum concentrations relative to MIC but whether capreomycin has therapeutic benefit despite microbiological resistance remains unclear. Methods We reviewed the susceptibility profiles and outcomes associated with capreomycin usage in patients diagnosed with XDR-TB between August 2002 and October 2012 in two provinces of South Africa. Patients whose isolates were genotypically tested for capreomycin resistance were included in the analysis. Results Of 178 XDR-TB patients 41% were HIV-infected. 87% (154/178) isolates contained a capreomycin resistance-conferring mutation [80% (143/178) rrs A1401G and 6% (11/178) were heteroresistant (containing both the rrs A1401G mutation and wild-type sequences)]. Previous MDR-TB treatment, prior usage of kanamycin, or strain type was not associated with capreomycin resistance. 92% (163/178) of XDR-TB patients were empirically treated with capreomycin. Capreomycin resistance decreased the odds of sputum culture conversion. In capreomycin sensitive and resistant persons combined weight at diagnosis was the only independent predictor for survival (p=<0.001). By contrast, HIV status and use of co-amoxicillin/clavulanic acid were independent predictors of mortality (p=<0.05). Capreomycin usage was not associated with survival or culture conversion when the analysis was restricted to those whose isolates were resistant to capreomycin. Conclusion In South Africa the frequency of capreomycin conferring mutations was extremely high in XDR-TB isolates. In those with capreomycin resistance there appeared to be no therapeutic benefit of using capreomycin. These data inform susceptibility testing and the design of treatment regimens for XDR-TB in TB endemic settings.		MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; COHORT
10.5578_mb.9170	The First Step for National Tuberculosis Laboratory Surveillance; Ankara, 2011	"The most effective method for monitoring country-level drug resistance frequency and to implement the necessary control measures is the establishment of a laboratory-based surveillance system. The aim of this study was to summarize the follow up trend of the drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) cases, determine the load of resistance and evaluate the capacities of laboratories depending on laboratory quality assurance system for the installation work of National Tuberculosis Laboratory Surveillance Network (TuLSA) which has started in Ankara in 2011. TuLSA studies was carried out under the coordination of National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory (NRL) with the participation of TB laboratories and dispensaries. Specimens of TB patients, reported from health institutions, were followed in TB laboratories, and the epidemiological information was collected from the dispensaries. One isolate per patient with the drug susceptibility test (DST) results were sent to NRL from TB laboratories and in NRL the isolates were rechecked with the genotypical (MTBDRplus, Hain Lifescience, Germany) and phenotypical (MGIT 960, BD, USA) DST methods. Molecular epidemiological analysis were also performed by spoligotyping and MIRU/VNTR. Second-line DST was applied to the isolates resistant to rifampin. A total of 1276 patients were reported between January 1st to December 31th 2011, and 335 cases were defined as ""pulmonary TB from Ankara province"". The mean age of those patients was 43.4 +/- 20 years, and 67.5% were male. Three hundred seventeen (94.6%) patients were identified as new cases. The average sample number obtained from pulmonary TB cases was 3.26 +/- 2.88, and 229 (68.3%) of them was culture positive. DST was applied to all culture positive isolates; 90.4% (207/229) of cases were susceptible to the five drugs tested (ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, rifannpicin, streptomycin). Eight (3.5%) of the isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB), while no extensively drug-resistant strains were detected. MDR-TB is likely to occur in 63.3 times more among previously treated cases, and 73.3 times more in legal aliens. The achievement of therapy among pulmonary TB cases was 91.9%. Spoligotyping performed for 221 M.tuberculosis complex isolates, showed that all strains were clustered in nine groups. SIT 41 (105/221; 47.5%) was the most frequent spoligotype detected, and clustering rate based on MIRU-VNTR results were found as 16.3%. All of the clustered strains were sensitive while all of MDR-TB isolates showed specific MIRU-VNTR profiles. In conclusion, TuLSA studies started in Ankara in 2011 and the system is still expanding in the country. Our data obtained with TuLSA have been published as a regional surveillance data in the WHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2011, and as a national surveillance data in Global Tuberculosis Report 2012."

10.1128_AAC.04933_14	Analysis of embCAB Mutations Associated with Ethambutol Resistance in Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates from China	Ethambutol (EMB) plays a pivotal role in the chemotherapy of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Resistance to EMB is considered to be caused by mutations in the embCAB operon (embC, embA, and embB). In this study, we analyzed the embCAB mutations among 139 MDR-TB isolates from China and found a possible association between embCAB operon mutation and EMB resistance. Our data indicate that 56.8% of MDR-TB isolates are resistant to EMB, and 82.2% of EMB-resistant isolates belong to the Beijing family. Overall, 110 (79.1%) MDR-TB isolates had at least one mutation in the embCAB operon. The majority of mutations were present in the embB gene and the embA upstream region, which also displayed significant correlations with EMB resistance. The most common mutations occurred at codon 306 in embB (embB306), followed by embB406, embA(-16), and embB497. Mutations at embB306 were associated with EMB resistance. DNA sequencing of embB306-497 was the best strategy for detecting EMB resistance, with 89.9% sensitivity, 58.3% specificity, and 76.3% accuracy. Additionally, embB306 had limited value as a candidate predictor for EMB resistance among MDR-TB infections in China.		MOLECULAR CHARACTERISTICS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; EMBB MUTATIONS; GENE; DNA
10.1128_AAC.04221_14	Tuberculous Spondylitis in Russia and Prominent Role of Multidrug-Resistant Clone Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing B0/W148	Extrapulmonary and, in particular, spinal tuberculosis (TB) constitutes a minor but significant part of the total TB incidence. In spite of this, almost no studies on the genetic diversity and drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from spinal TB patients have been published to date. Here, we report results of the first Russian and globally largest molecular study of M. tuberculosis isolates recovered from patients with tuberculous spondylitis (TBS). The majority of 107 isolates were assigned to the Beijing genotype (n = 80); the other main families were T (n = 11), Ural (n = 7), and LAM (n = 4). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was more frequently found among Beijing (90.5%) and, intriguingly, Ural (71.4%) isolates than other genotypes (5%; P < 0.001). The extremely drug-resistant (XDR) phenotype was exclusively found in the Beijing isolates (n = 7). A notable prevalence of the rpoB531 and katG315 mutations in Beijing strains that were similarly high in both TBS (this study) and published pulmonary TB (PTB) samples from Russia shows that TBS and PTB Beijing strains follow the same paradigm of acquisition of rifampin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) resistance. The 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable-number tandem-repeat (MIRU-VNTR) subtyping of 80 Beijing isolates further discriminated them into 24 types (Hunter Gaston index [HGI] = 0.83); types 100-32 and 94-32 represented the largest groups. A genotype of Russian successful clone B0/W148 was identified in 30 of 80 Beijing isolates. In conclusion, this study highlighted a crucial impact of the Beijing genotype and the especially prominent role of its MDR-associated successful clone B0/W148 cluster in the development of spinal MDR-TB in Russian patients.

pub-0633	Sensitivity Pattern of Second Line Anti-Tuberculosis Drugs against Clinical Isolates of Multidrug Resistant Mycobacterium Tuberculosis	Objective: To determine the current sensitivity pattern of second line anti-tuberculosis drugs against clinical isolates of Multidrug Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Study Design: A cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP), Rawalpindi, from November 2011 to April 2013. Methodology: Samples received during the study period were processed on BACTEC MGIT 960 system for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) culture followed by first line drugs susceptibility testing of culture proven MTB isolates. On the basis of resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid, 100 clinical isolates of MDR-TB were further subjected to susceptibility testing against amikacin (AMK), capreomycin (CAP), ofloxacin (OFL) and ethionamide (ETH) as per standard BACTEC MGIT 960 instructions. Results: Out of 100 MDR-TB isolates, 62% were from male patients and 38% from female patients. 97% were sensitive to AMK, 53% to OFL, 87% to CAP; and 87% were sensitive to ETH. Conclusion: The majority of the MDR-TB isolates showed excellent sensitivity against AMK, CAP and ETH. However, sensitivity of MDR-TB isolates against fluoroquinolones like OFL was not encouraging.

10.1371_journal.pone.0122574	Optimizing Tuberculosis Case Detection through a Novel Diagnostic Device Placement Model: The Case of Uganda	Background Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) is being widely adopted in high TB burden countries. Analysis is needed to guide the placement of devices within health systems to optimize the tuberculosis (TB) case detection rate (CDR). Methods We used epidemiological and operational data from Uganda (139 sites serving 87,600 individuals tested for TB) to perform a model-based comparison of the following placement strategies for Xpert devices: 1) Health center level (sites ranked by size from national referral hospitals to health care level III centers), 2) Smear volume (sites ranked from highest to lowest volume of smear microscopy testing), 3) Antiretroviral therapy (ART) volume (sites ranked from greatest to least patients on ART), 4) External equality assessment (EQA) performance (sites ranked from worst to best smear microscopy performance) and 5) TB prevalence (sites ranked from highest to lowest). We compared two clinical algorithms, one where Xpert was used only for smear microscopy negative samples versus another replacing smear microscopy. The primary outcome was TB CDR; secondary outcomes were detection of multi-drug resistant TB, number of sites requiring device placement to achieve specified rollout coverage, and cost. Results Placement strategies that prioritized sites with higher TB prevalence maximized CDR, with an incremental rate of 6.2-12.6% compared to status quo (microscopy alone). Diagnosis of MDR-TB was greatest in the TB Prevalence strategy when Xpert was used in place of smear microscopy. While initial implementation costs were lowest in the Smear Volume strategy, cost per additional TB case detected was lowest in the TB prevalence strategy. Conclusion In Uganda, placement of Xpert devices in sites with high TB prevalence yielded the highest TB CDR at the lowest cost per additional case diagnosed. These results represent novel use of program level data to inform the optimal placement of new technology in resource-constrained settings.		TOOLS; TECHNOLOGIES; RESISTANCE
10.5588_ijtld.14.0415	Low rates of recurrence after successful treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Tomsk, Russia	SETTING: Tomsk, Russia, where multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is prevalent. OBJECTIVES: To report rates of recurrence following successful treatment of MDR-TB in a program providing individualized treatment regimens designed according to the current global standard of care. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of 408 adults successfully treated for pulmonary MDR-TB from 10 September 2000 to 1 November 2004, and followed for up to 6 years post-treatment. We used Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations to assess whether recurrence rates changed significantly with time. RESULTS: We analyzed 399 (97.5%) patients with at least one follow-up visit (15 850 person-months of observation [PMO]). Baseline resistance to second-line drugs was common (65.2%); 398 patients (99.7%) were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative. In the first year of post-treatment follow-up, there were six episodes of recurrence (1.4/1000 PMO, 95%CI 0.5-3.0). After the first post-treatment year, there were 21 episodes of recurrence (1.8/1000 PM0, 95%CI 1.1-2.8). The rate did not change significantly with time. CONCLUSION: Individualized regimens designed according to the current global standard of care achieved low rates of MDR-TB recurrence among non-HIV-infected persons treated in a programmatic setting.	anti-tuberculosis medications; cohort study; programmatic setting; drug-resistant tuberculosis	RETROSPECTIVE COHORT; AGGRESSIVE REGIMENS; RELAPSE
10.5588_ijtld.14.0838	Highly successful treatment outcome of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the Netherlands, 2000-2009	SETTING: Resistance to the two key anti-tuberculosis drugs isoniazid and rifampicin is a characteristic of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). MDR-TB is a scourge requiring toxic, prolonged treatment and is associated with poor outcomes. The Netherlands is a country with a long-standing, integrated, well-resourced TB service where all patients are offered culture-confirmed diagnosis by a central reference laboratory. OBJECTIVE: To assess the treatment outcomes of MDR-TB patients over a period of 10 years in The Netherlands. DESIGN: Demographic, clinical and microbiological features of all patients with MDR-TB who started treatment in 2000-2009 in the Netherlands were analysed from national registry and patient records. RESULTS: Characteristics of the 113 MDR-TB patients were as follows: male/female ratio 1.57, 96% foreign born, median age 29 years, 96 (85%) pulmonary TB, 56 (50%) smear-positive, 14 (12%) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infected. Of the 104 (92%) patients who started MDR-TB treatment, 86% had a successful outcome using a median of six active drugs; eight underwent pulmonary surgery. HIV negativity was associated with successful outcome (adjusted OR 2.1, 95 %CI 1.1-3.8). CONCLUSION: High success rates for MDR-TB treatment were achieved with close collaboration of all stakeholders, reaching the targets set for drug-susceptible TB. HIV remained an independent risk factor for unsuccessful treatment outcome.

10.5588_ijtld.14.0485	Treatment interruption and directly observed treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients in China	BACKGROUND: China has nearly one fifth of global multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases, and follows the 24-month World Health Organization (WHO) standardised regimens. OBJECTIVE: To assess treatment interruption among MDR-TB patients and its association with the provision of directly observed treatment (DOT). METHODS: We reviewed clinical charts and conducted a questionnaire survey among all confirmed MDR-TB patients who had been treated for at least 6 months from 1 January 2009 to 30 April 2012 in Shandong Province. Treatment interruption was defined as missing a dose for at least 1 day but for <8 consecutive weeks; the subset 'severe interruption' was defined as missing doses for 2-8 consecutive weeks. RESULTS: Of 110 patients, 75 (68%) interrupted treatment; 19 (17%) reported severe interruption, with a median duration of 30 days. Of the 110 patients, 26 (24%) received injections from family members and 55 (50%) received DOT, 7 (13%) from village doctors and 48 (87%) from family members. Patients who underwent DOT with a family member had less severe interruptions (OR 0.25, 95%CI 0.05-0.98) than those who were given DOT by a village doctor or who did not undergo DOT. CONCLUSIONS: Family members may act as treatment supporters for MDR-TB patients to reduce treatment interruptions, but require orientation on their role.

10.5588_ijtld.14.0596	Genetic mutations associated with rifampicin and isoniazid resistance in MDR-TB patients in North-West India	BACKGROUND: Effective tuberculosis (TB) control has been hindered by the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). OBJECTIVE: To analyse the frequency of drug resistance among presumed cases of drug-resistant TB in the state of Punjab, India, and to determine the frequency of various genetic mutations detected using the line-probe assay (LPA). METHODS: Eight hundred patients with presumptive drug-resistant TB were enrolled under the programmatic management of drug-resistant TB under India's Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme. Sputum samples from these patients were subjected to smear microscopy and LPA. Clinicodemographic details along with drug resistance patterns and genetic mutations were studied. RESULTS: After excluding non-eligible samples, 545 samples were analysed, of which 290 (53.2%) showed resistance. Isoniazid and rifampicin (RMP) monoresistance were detected in respectively 9.3% (51/545) and 18% (98/545) of samples, while MDR was present in 25.8% (141/545) of samples. Of the MDR-TB cases, 2.1% (3/141) were treatment-nave, while 90.8% (128/141) were on retreatment. The most common mutation conferring RMP resistance was S531L. CONCLUSION: All patients undergoing retreatment for TB should be tested for drug susceptibility at the initial evaluation. Factors responsible for high MDR-TB and heteroresistance in Punjab need further studies.	drug-resistant tuberculosis; Punjab; genetic mutations; LPA; MTBDRplus	LINE PROBE ASSAY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; HETERO-RESISTANCE; PREVALENCE; MECHANISMS; DIAGNOSIS; MUMBAI
10.1183_09031936.00124614	Availability, price and affordability of anti-tuberculosis drugs in Europe: a TBNET survey	Data on availability and cost of anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs in relation to affordability at national level are scarce. We performed a cross-sectional study on availability and cost of anti-TB drugs at major TB-reference centres in 37 European countries. Costs of standardised treatment regimens used for pan-sensitive TB, multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB, pre-extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB, and XDR-TB were compared using a purchasing power analysis. Affordability was evaluated in relation to monthly national gross domestic products per capita (GDP). At least one second-line injectable and either moxifloxacin or levofloxacin were available in all countries. Linezolid and clofazimine were available in 79% and 46% of the countries, respectively. Drug cost for XDR-TB was three-times more expensive than those for MDR-TB. The average price of treatment for pan-sensitive TB represented a maximum of 8.5% of the monthly GDP across countries, while for standard MDR-TB treatment this was <30% in only six countries and more than 100% in four countries. Treatment of XDR-TB represented more than 100% of a month's GDP in all countries where the regimen was available. High cost and limited availability of drugs for treatment of drug-resistant TB, particularly beyond resistance to first-line drugs, are a major impediment to successful TB control in Europe.

10.1371_journal.pone.0122769	Improvement in Plasma Drug Activity during the Early Treatment Interval among Tanzanian Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Background Individual pharmacokinetic variability may be common in patients treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) but data are sparse from resource-limited settings and across the early treatment interval. Methods Plasma drug activity, as measured by the TB Drug Activity (TDA) assay at 2 and 4 weeks of treatment with a standardized MDR-TB regimen was performed in patients with pulmonary MDR-TB from Tanzania. TDA values were correlated with measures of early treatment outcome including every two week collection of sputum for time-to-positivity (TTP) in liquid culture from the MGIT 960 automated system. Patients were evaluated at 24 weeks and those surviving without delayed sputum culture conversion (> 8 weeks), culture reversion after previously negative, or weight loss were defined as having a favorable outcome. Results Twenty-five patients were enrolled with a mean age of 37 +/- 12 years. All were culture positive from the pretreatment sputum sample with a mean TTP in MGIT of 257 +/- 134 hours, and the median time to culture conversion on treatment was 6 weeks. Twenty patients (80%) had an increase in TDA, with the overall mean TDA at 2 weeks of 2.1 +/- 0.7 compared to 2.4 +/- 0.8 at 4 weeks (p = 0.005). At 2 weeks 13 subjects (52%) had a TDA value > 2-log killing against their own M. tuberculosis isolate compared to 17 subjects (68%) at 4 weeks (McNemar's exact test p = 0.29). An interim treatment outcome was able to be determined in 23 patients (92%), of whom 7 had a poor outcome (30%). An increase in TDA from week 2 to week 4 was associated with favorable outcome, [unadjusted OR = 20.0, 95% CI: 1.61-247.98, exact p = 0.017 and adjusted OR = 19.33, 95% CI: 1.55-241.5, exact p = 0.023]. Conclusions The majority of patients with MDR-TB in Tanzania had an increase in plasma drug activity from week 2 to week 4 of treatment as measured by the TDA assay. Understanding the etiology and full impact of this dynamic may inform therapeutic intervention.		MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; TIME; PERMEABILITY; GROWTH
10.1186_s12859_015_0535_y	Prediction of host - pathogen protein interactions between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Homo sapiens using sequence motifs	Background: Emergence of multiple drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB) threatens to derail global efforts aimed at reigning in the pathogen. Co-infections of M. tuberculosis with HIV are difficult to treat. To counter these new challenges, it is essential to study the interactions between M. tuberculosis and the host to learn how these bacteria cause disease. Results: We report a systematic flow to predict the host pathogen interactions (HPIs) between M. tuberculosis and Homo sapiens based on sequence motifs. First, protein sequences were used as initial input for identifying the HPIs by 'interolog' method. HPIs were further filtered by prediction of domain-domain interactions (DDIs). Functional annotations of protein and publicly available experimental results were applied to filter the remaining HPIs. Using such a strategy, 118 pairs of HPIs were identified, which involve 43 proteins from M. tuberculosis and 48 proteins from Homo sapiens. A biological interaction network between M. tuberculosis and Homo sapiens was then constructed using the predicted inter-and intra-species interactions based on the 118 pairs of HPIs. Finally, a web accessible database named PATH (Protein interactions of M. tuberculosis and Human) was constructed to store these predicted interactions and proteins. Conclusions: This interaction network will facilitate the research on host-pathogen protein-protein interactions, and may throw light on how M. tuberculosis interacts with its host.

10.1186_s40249_015_0045_1	Factors associated with primary transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis compared with healthy controls in Henan Province, China	Background: It is estimated that there are about 74,000 primary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients per year according to the prevalence of MDR-TB of 5.7% among new TB patients in China. Thus, the risks of primary transmission of MDR-TB require further attention. This study aimed to identify the factors associated with primary transmission of MDR-TB in Henan province, where the number of new TB patients is ranked second highest in China. Methods: A 1:1 matched case-control study was conducted in Henan, China. Cases were primary MDR-TB patients who were individually matched with a healthy control without TB from the same neighborhood. The study was conducted from July 2013 to June 2014. Both case and control were matched by age (+/- 5 years) and sex. Conditional logistic regression was used to compute adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk factors associated with primary MDR-TB. Results: For the study, 146 pairs of participants were recruited. The final multivariable logistic regression model disclosed that after adjusting for age and sex, primary MDR-TB cases were more likely to be single (AOR, 5.4; 95% CI, 1.4-20.7), earn an annual income of <= 12,000 yuan (RMB) (AOR, 9.9; 95% CI, 2.0-48.1), experience more life pressure/stress (AOR, 10.8; 95% CI, 2.8-41.5), not be medically insured (AOR, 50.1; 95% CI, 8.2-306.8), and suffer from diabetes, cardiovascular disease or other respiratory diseases, or cancer (AOR, 57.1; 95% CI, 8.6-424.2). Conclusions: In order to control primary transmission of MDR-TB in China, we recommend that improving the social support, living standards and medical security of the lower social class become a priority.

10.1371_journal.pone.0120763	Cost-Effectiveness of Adding Bedaquiline to Drug Regimens for the Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in the UK	Objective To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding bedaquiline to a background regimen (BR) of drugs for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the United Kingdom (UK). Methods A cohort-based Markov model was developed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of bedaquiline plus BR (BBR) versus BR alone (BR) in the treatment of MDR-TB, over a 10-year time horizon. A National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services perspective was considered. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated in terms of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). Data were sourced from a phase II, placebo-controlled trial, NHS reference costs, and the literature; the US list price of bedaquiline was used and converted to pounds ( pound 18,800). Costs and effectiveness were discounted at a rate of 3.5% per annum. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analysis was conducted. Results The total discounted cost per patient (pp) on BBR was pound 106,487, compared with pound 117,922 for BR. The total discounted QALYs pp were 5.16 for BBR and 4.01 for BR. The addition of bedaquiline to a BR resulted in a cost-saving of pound 11,434 and an additional 1.14 QALYs pp over a 10-year period, and is therefore considered to be the dominant (less costly and more effective) strategy over BR. BBR remained dominant in the majority of sensitivity analyses, with a 81% probability of being dominant versus BR in the probabilistic analysis. Conclusions In the UK, bedaquiline is likely to be cost-effective and cost-saving, compared with the current MDR-TB standard of care under a range of scenarios. Cost-savings over a 10-year period were realized from reductions in length of hospitalization, which offset the bedaquiline drug costs. The cost-benefit conclusions held after several sensitivity analyses, thus validating assumptions made, and suggesting that the results would hold even if the actual price of bedaquiline in the UK were higher than in the US.

10.1371_journal.pone.0119332	Mortality among MDR-TB Cases: Comparison with Drug-Susceptible Tuberculosis and Associated Factors	Background An increase in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases is evident worldwide. Its management implies a complex treatment, high costs, more toxic anti-tuberculosis drug use, longer treatment time and increased treatment failure and mortality. The aims of this study were to compare mortality between MDR and drug-susceptible cases of tuberculosis, and to determine risk factors associated with mortality among MDR-TB cases. Methods and Results A retrospective cohort study was performed using data from clinical records of the National Strategy for Prevention and Control of Tuberculosis in Lima, Peru. In the first objective, MDR-TB, compared to drug-susceptible cases, was the main exposure variable and time to death, censored at 180 days, the outcome of interest. For the second objective, different variables obtained from clinical records were assessed as potential risk factors for death among MDR-TB cases. Cox regression analysis was used to determine hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A total of 1,232 patients were analyzed: mean age 30.9 +/- 14.0 years, 60.0% were males. 61 patients (5.0%) died during treatment, whereas the MDR-TB prevalence was 19.2%. MDR-TB increased the risk of death during treatment (HR = 7.5; IC95%: 4.1-13.4) when compared to presumed drug-susceptible cases after controlling for potential confounders. Education level (p = 0.01), previous TB episodes (p<0.001), diabetes history (p<0.001) and HIV infection (p = 0.04) were factors associated with mortality among MDR-TB cases. Conclusions MDR-TB is associated with an increased risk of death during treatment. Lower education, greater number of previous TB episodes, diabetes history, and HIV infection were independently associated with mortality among MDR-TB cases. New strategies for appropriate MDR-TB detection and management should be implemented, including drug sensitivity tests, diabetes and HIV screening, as well as guarantee for a complete adherence to therapy.

10.1371_journal.pone.0120161	Doing No Harm? Adverse Events in a Nation-Wide Cohort of Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Nigeria	Background Adverse events (AEs) of second line anti-tuberculosis drugs (SLDs) are relatively well documented. However, the actual burden has rarely been described in detail in programmatic settings. We investigated the occurrence of these events in the national cohort of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients in Nigeria. Method This was a retrospective, observational cohort study, using pharmacovigilance data systematically collected at all MDR-TB treatment centers in Nigeria. Characteristics of AEs during the intensive phase treatment were documented, and risk factors for development of AEs were assessed. Results Four hundred and sixty patients were included in the analysis: 62% were male; median age was 33 years [Interquartile Range (IQR): 28-42] and median weight was 51 kg (IQR: 45-59). Two hundred and three (44%) patients experienced AEs; four died of conditions associated with SLD AEs. Gastro-intestinal (n = 100), neurological (n = 75), ototoxic (n = 72) and psychiatric (n = 60) AEs were the most commonly reported, whereas ototoxic and psychiatric AEs were the most debilitating. Majority of AEs developed after 1-2 months of therapy, and resolved in less than a month after treatment. Some treatment centers were twice as likely to report AEs compared with others, highlighting significant inconsistencies in reporting at different treatment centers. Patients with a higher body weight had an increased risk of experiencing AEs. No differences were observed in risk of AEs between HIV-infected and uninfected patients. Similarly, age was not significantly associated with AEs. Conclusion Patients in the Nigerian MDR-TB cohort experienced a wide range of AEs, some of which were disabling and fatal. Early identification and prompt management as well as standardized reporting of AEs at all levels of healthcare, including the community is urgently needed. Safer regimens for drug-resistant TB with the shortest duration are advocated.		DRUG-REACTIONS; PHARMACOVIGILANCE; DETERMINANTS; FREQUENCY; KNOWLEDGE
10.1016_j.bmcl.2015.01.050	A novel molecule with notable activity against multi-drug resistant tuberculosis	Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is emerging as a serious global health problem, which has been elevated through co-infection involving HIV and MDR-Mtb. The discovery of new compounds with anti-MDR TB efficacy and favorable metabolism profiles is an important scientific challenge. Using computational biology and ligand docking data, we have conceived a multifunctional molecule, 2, as a potential anti-MDR TB agent. This compound was produced through a multi-step synthesis. It exhibited significant in vitro activity against MDR-TB (MIC 1.56 mu g/mL) and its half-life (t(1/2)) in human liver microsomes was 14.4 h. The metabolic profiles of compound 2 with respect to human cytochrome P450 (CYP) and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isozymes were favorable. Compound 2 also had relatively low in vitro cytotoxicity in uninfected macrophages. It displayed synergistic behavior against MDR-TB in combination with PA-824. Interestingly, compound 2 also displayed in vitro anti-HIV activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.1371_journal.pone.0117421	High Rates of Ofloxacin Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis among Both New and Previously Treated Patients in Tamil Nadu, South India	Periodic drug resistance surveillance provides useful information on trends of drug resistance and effectiveness of tuberculosis (TB) control measures. The present study determines the prevalence of drug resistance among new sputum smear positive (NSP) and previously treated (PT) pulmonary TB patients, diagnosed at public sector designated microscopy centers (DMCs) in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. In this single-stage cluster-sampling prevalence survey, 70 of 700 DMCs were randomly selected using a probability-proportional to size method. A cluster size of 24 for NSP and a varying size of 0 to 99 for PT cases were fixed for each selected DMC. Culture and drug susceptibility testing was done on Lowenstein-Jensen medium using the economic variant of proportion sensitivity test for isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP), ofloxacin (OFX) and kanamycin (KAN). Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) status was collected from patient records. From June 2011 to August 2012, 1524 NSP and 901 PT patients were enrolled. Any RMP resistance and any INH resistance were observed in 2.6% and 15.1%, and in 10.4% and 30% respectively in NSP and PT cases. Among PT patients, multi drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) was highest in the treatment failure (35%) group, followed by relapse (13%) and treatment after default (10%) groups. Extensively drug resistant TB (XDRTB) was seen in 4.3% of MDR-TB cases. Any OFX resistance was seen in 10.4% of NSP, 13.9% of PT and 29% of PT MDR-TB patients. The HIV status of the patient had no impact on drug resistance levels. RMP resistance was present in 2.6% of new and 15.1% of previously treated patients in Tamil Nadu. Rates of OFX resistance were high among NSP and PT patients, especially among those with MDR-TB, a matter of concern for development of new treatment regimens for TB.

10.1128_AAC.04541_14	Phenotypic and Genotypic Characterization of Pyrazinamide Resistance among Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates in Zhejiang, China	To explore the phenotypic and genotypic characterization of pyrazinamide (PZA) resistance among multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates in Zhejiang province, a total of 274 MDR-TB isolates were collected. Drug susceptibility testing and spoligotyping were performed on all clinical isolates. In addition, the mutated features of PZA-resistant loci, including pncA and rpsA, were also analyzed by DNA sequencing. Our results showed that the prevalence of PZA resistance among MDR-TB strains in Zhejiang province was 43.07% and that PZA resistance was associated with concomitant resistance to streptomycin. The majority of PZA-resistant MDR-TB isolates belonged to the Beijing family. Mutations within pncA, not rpsA, constituted the primary mechanism of PZA resistance. Among 118 PZA-resistant isolates, 53 different mutations were observed in pncA, and most of them were point mutations. Compared with the phenotypic data, DNA sequencing of pncA has sensitivity and specificity of 77.97% and 96.79%, respectively. Analysis of pncA provided a robust tool for rapid detection of PZA drug resistance.		PNCA MUTATIONS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DIVERSITY; DIAGNOSIS; MUTANTS; STRAINS; RPSA
10.1007_s11673_014_9595_3	The Political and Ethical Challenge of Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis	This article critically examines current responses to multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and argues that bioethics needs to be willing to engage in a more radical critique of the problem than is currently offered. In particular, we need to focus not simply on market-driven models of innovation and anti-microbial solutions to emergent and re-emergent infections such as TB. The global community also needs to address poverty and the structural factors that entrench inequalities-thus moving beyond the orthodox medical/public health frame of reference.

10.1155_2015_359301	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: Treatment and outcomes of 93 patients	BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of death worldwide and the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) poses a threat to its control. There is scanty evidence regarding optimal management of MDR TB. The majority of Canadian cases of MDR TB are diagnosed in Ontario; most are managed by the Tuberculosis Service at West Park Healthcare Centre in Toronto. The authors reviewed 93 cases of MDR TB admitted from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2011. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were foreign born. Fifty-six percent had a previous diagnosis of TB and most (70%) had only pulmonary involvement. Symptoms included productive cough, weight loss, fever and malaise. The average length of inpatient stay was 126 days. All patients had a peripherally inserted central catheter for the intensive treatment phase because medications were given intravenously. Treatment lasted for 24 months after bacteriologic conversion, and included a mean (+/- SD) of 5 +/- 1 drugs. A successful outcome at the end of treatment was observed in 84% of patients. Bacteriological conversion was achieved in 98% of patients with initial positive sputum cultures; conversion occurred by four months in 91%. CONCLUSIONS: MDR TB can be controlled with the available anti-TB drugs.	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; Outcomes; Review; Treatment	METAANALYSIS; HEPATOTOXICITY; CLOFAZIMINE; REGIMENS
10.1016_j.ijid.2015.01.016	Cellular therapy in Tuberculosis	Cellular therapy now offer promise of potential adjunct therapeutic options for treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). We review here the role of Mesenchymal stromal cells, (MSCs), as well as other immune effector cells in the therapy of infectious diseases with a focus on TB. MSCs represent a population of tissue-resident non-hematopoietic adult progenitor cells which home into injured tissues increase the proliferative potential of broncho-alveolar stem cells and restore lung epithelium. MSCs have been shown to be immune-modulatory and anti-inflammatory mediated via cell-cell contacts as well as soluble factors. We discuss the functional profile of MSCs and their potential use for adjunct cellular therapy of multi-drug resistant TB, with the aim of limiting tissue damage, and to convert unproductive inflammatory responses into effective anti-pathogen directed immune responses. Adjunct cellular therapy could potentially offer salvage therapy options for patients with drug-resistant TB, increase clinically relevant anti-M. tuberculosis directed immune responses and possibly shorten the duration of anti-TB therapy.

10.1016_j.ijid.2014.12.001	Therapeutic drug monitoring: how to improve drug dosage and patient safety in tuberculosis treatment	In this article we describe the key role of tuberculosis (TB) treatment, the challenges (mainly the emergence of drug resistance), and the opportunities represented by the correct approach to drug dosage, based on the existing control and elimination strategies. In this context, the role and contribution of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is discussed in detail. Treatment success in multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB cases is low (62%, with 7% failing or relapsing and 9% dying) and in extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB cases is even lower (40%, with 22% failing or relapsing and 15% dying). The treatment of drug-resistant TB is also more expensive (exceeding (sic)50 000 for MDR-TB and (sic)160 000 for XDR-TB) and more toxic if compared to that prescribed for drug-susceptible TB. Appropriate dosing of first-and second-line anti-TB drugs can improve the patient's prognosis and lower treatment costs. TDM is based on the measurement of drug concentrations in blood samples collected at appropriate times and subsequent dose adjustment according to the target concentration. The 'dried blood spot' technique offers additional advantages, providing the rationale for discussions regarding a possible future network of selected, quality-controlled reference laboratories for the processing of dried blood spots of difficult-to-treat patients from reference TB clinics around the world.

10.1016_j.ijid.2015.01.006	Fluoroquinolone-resistant tuberculosis: implications in settings with weak healthcare systems	Fluoroquinolones (FQ) play an essential role in the treatment and control of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). They are also being evaluated as part of newer regimens under development for drug-sensitive TB. As newer FQ-based regimens are explored, knowledge of FQ resistance data from high TB burden countries becomes essential. We examine available FQ resistance data from high TB burden countries and demonstrate the need for comprehensive surveys to evaluate FQ resistance in these countries. The factors driving FQ resistance in such conditions and the cost of such resistance to weak healthcare systems are discussed. The need for a comprehensive policy for addressing the issue of FQ resistance is highlighted. (c) 2015 The Authors.

10.1016_j.ijid.2014.12.014	Perspectives on tuberculosis in pregnancy	Tuberculosis (TB) has been recognized as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in pregnancy for nearly a century, but research and efforts to roll out comprehensive TB screening and treatment in high-risk populations such as those with a high prevalence of HIV or other diseases of poverty, have lagged behind similar efforts to address HIV infection in pregnancy and the prevention of mother-to-child-transmission. Immunological changes during pregnancy make the activation of latent TB infection or de novo infection more likely than among non-pregnant women. TB treatment in pregnancy poses several problems that have been under-researched, such as contraindications to anti-TB and anti-HIV drugs and potential risks to the neonate, which are particularly important with respect to second-line TB treatment. Whilst congenital TB is thought to be rare, data from high HIV burden settings suggest this is not the case. There is a need for more studies screening for TB in neonates and observing outcomes, and testing preventative or curative actions. National tuberculosis control programmes (NTPs) should work with antenatal and national HIV programmes in high-burden populations to provide screening at antenatal clinics, or to establish functioning systems whereby pregnant women at high risk can drop in to routine NTP screening stations.

10.1016_j.ijid.2014.12.003	Why healthcare workers are sick of TB	Dr Thato Mosidi never expected to be diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB), despite widely prevalent exposure and very limited infection control measures. The life-threatening diagnosis of primary extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) came as an even greater shock. The inconvenient truth is that, rather than being protected, Dr Mosidi and thousands of her healthcare colleagues are at an increased risk of TB and especially drug-resistant TB. In this viewpoint paper we debunk the widely held false belief that healthcare workers are somehow immune to TB disease (TB-proof) and explore some of the key factors contributing to the pervasive stigmatization and subsequent non-disclosure of occupational TB. Our front-line workers are some of the first to suffer the consequences of a progressively more resistant and fatal TB epidemic, and urgent interventions are needed to ensure the safety and continued availability of these precious healthcare resources. These include the rapid development and scale-up of improved diagnostic and treatment options, strengthened infection control measures, and focused interventions to tackle stigma and discrimination in all its forms. We call our colleagues to action to protect themselves and those they care for. (c) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

10.1016_j.ijid.2014.12.024	Supporting clinical management of the difficult-to-treat TB cases: the ERS-WHO TB Consilium	Multi-drug and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/XDR-TB) are considered a serious threat for TB control and elimination. The outcome of these patients is still largely unsatisfactory as of today, with treatment success rates being consistently below 50% at global level. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that management of MDR-TB cases is supported by a specialized team, including complementary medical professionals able to cover several perspectives (clinical, both for adults and children; surgical; radiological; public health; psychological; nursing, among others). Implementation of such a body (known as Consilium in most of the former Soviet Union countries) is often a pre-requisite to apply for international TB control funding and concessionally priced medicines to treat M/XDR-TB cases. The primary objective of the ERS/WHO TB Consilium is to provide clinical consultation for drug-resistant TB and other difficult-to-treat TB cases, including co-infection with HIV and paediatric cases. Through technical guidance to clinicians managing complex TB cases, the main contribution and outcome of the initiative will be a public health response aimed at achieving correct treatment of affected patients and preventing further development of drug resistance. The Consilum's secondary objective is to ensure monitoring and evaluation of clinical practices on the ground (diagnosis, treatment and prevention). (c) 2014 The Authors.

10.1002_jcla.21742	Comparison of Three Molecular Assays for the Detection of Rifampin Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	BackgroundRifampin (RIF) is the most important first-line antituberculosis drug, and resistance to this drug may result in treatment failures. We evaluated the diagnostic performances of recently introduced, molecular assays for the detection of RIF resistance. MethodsA total of 100 isolates (50 RIF resistant and 50 RIF susceptible) were studied. Their RIF resistances were determined by conventional drug-susceptibility test. These results were compared with those of three molecular assays: Xpert MTB/RIF assay (MTB is Mycobacterium tuberculosis), Sacace MTB Real-TM resistance, and AdvanSure MDR-TB GenoBlot assay (MDR is multidrug resisitant). ResultsSensitivities for RIF resistance detection of Xpert MTB/RIF assay, Sacace MTB Real-TM resistance, and Advansure GenoBlot assay were 94.0%, 91.8%, and 84.0%, respectively. Their specificities for RIF resistance detection were all 100%. ConclusionThree molecular assays for the detection of RIF resistance have various performances. Xpert MTB/RIF assay shows the highest sensitivity among the three molecular assays and can be an effective choice in clinical laboratories.	tuberculosis; resistance; rifampin; molecular assay	XPERT MTB/RIF ASSAY; NONRESPIRATORY SPECIMENS; RAPID DETECTION; DIAGNOSIS
10.1016_j.jgar.2014.10.002	Detection of novel and reported mutations in the rpoB, katG and inhA genes in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis isolates: A hospital-based study	The objective of this study was to detect mutations associated with isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF) resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from newly diagnosed and previously treated tuberculosis patients using a PCR-based DNA sequencing technique. Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing was performed using a BACTEC (TM) MicroMGIT Culture System in 354 M. tuberculosis isolates. Among the 354 isolates, 18 were multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). PCR-based DNA sequencing was performed targeting the rpoB gene for RIF and the whole of the katG gene and the promoter and coding region of the inhA gene for INH. Results were analysed using MultAlin analysis to identify the presence of polymorphisms or mutations by comparing with already available GenBank sequences. Only 37.5% of RIF-resistant isolates showed the presence of the most commonly reported mutation (Ser531Leu). The most commonly reported mutation (Ser531Leu) was detected in six MDR-TB isolates. The frequency of mutations associated with INH resistance was 31.5% (17/54) and 29.6% (16/54) for katG and inhA, respectively. Comparing the relative distribution of mutations in the two target loci revealed that 12 isolates (22.2%) had a mutation in both katG and inhA. Apart from previously reported mutations in the katG gene, there were three novel deletion and six novel substitution mutations. As reported in previous studies, Ser531Leu was the most common mutation detected in RIF-resistant isolates. The genetic mechanism of INH resistance in M. tuberculosis is highly complex involving several genes, and much remains to be explored to achieve a better understanding of this complex mechanism.

10.5588_ijtld.14.0629	The impact of Xpert (R) MTB/RIF depends on service coordination: experience in Burkina Faso	Translating the potential of Xpert (R) MTB/RIF into more effective tuberculosis (TB) care and control in low-income settings is challenged by operational issues. We report the experience in introducing this technology in Burkina Faso through a centralised approach. Xpert was successfully integrated into the diagnostic algorithm of multidrug-resistant TB cases. However, barriers to Xpert use for the diagnosis of TB in vulnerable populations, such as persons living with human immunodeficiency virus infection and children, were observed, mainly due to lack of coordination between services. Lessons learnt can be exploited to optimise the roll-out of this technology at country level.	MDR-TB; PLHIV; childhood TB; prisoners; resource-constrained countries	TUBERCULOSIS
10.5588_ijtld.14.0406	MTBDRplus results correlate with treatment outcome in previously treated tuberculosis patients	BACKGROUND: Although MTBDRplus is validated for the detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), its role in the assessment of treatment outcome is less clear. We evaluated the association of MTBDRplus results with treatment outcome in new and previously treated patients in an endemic setting in China and determined factors associated with poor treatment outcomes. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 298 smear-positive pulmonary TB patients who received the World Health Organization recommended initial treatment regimen or retreatment regimen. MTBDRplus was compared with conventional drug susceptibility testing and DNA sequencing for the detection of MDR-TB. Treatment responses were monitored using sputum smear, culture and chest radiography. RESULTS: MTBDRplus successfully identified all MDR-TB and had good concordance with sequencing. MDR-TB rates were low among new patients (4/187, 2.1%), but high in previously treated patients (12/28, 42.9%); 65.2% (15/23) of previously treated cases and 17.1% (27/158) of new cases were unsuccessfully treated (P < 0.001). Seven of eight (87.5%) previously treated MDR-TB patients failed the retreatment regimen. In addition to drug resistance, sputum smear positivity at week 8 and cavitation are associated with treatment failure. CONCLUSION: Not only did MTBDRplus correctly identify all MDR-TB cases, MTBDRplus results are also associated with treatment outcomes in previously treated patients. The retreatment regimen should no longer be used; treatment should be guided by molecular testing.

10.3201_eid2103.141343	Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Europe, 2010-2011	Drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis is challenging elimination of tuberculosis (TB). We evaluated risk factors for TB and levels of second-line drug resistance in M. tuberculosis in patients in Europe with multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. A total of 380 patients with MDR TB and 376 patients with non-MDR TB were enrolled at 23 centers in 16 countries in Europe during 2010-2011. A total of 52.4% of MDR TB patients had never been treated for TB, which suggests primary transmission of MDR M. tuberculosis. At initiation of treatment for MDR TB, 59.7% of M. tuberculosis strains tested were resistant to pyrazinamide, 51.1% were resistant to >= 1 second-line drug, 26.6% were resistant to second-line injectable drugs, 17.6% were resistant to fluoroquinolones, and 6.8% were extensively drug resistant. Previous treatment for TB was the strongest risk factor for MDR TB. High levels of primary transmission and advanced resistance to second-line drugs characterize MDR TB cases in Europe.

10.1093_jac_dku438	Revisiting susceptibility testing in MDR-TB by a standardized quantitative phenotypic assessment in a European multicentre study	Objectives: Treatment outcome of MDR-TB is critically dependent on the proper use of second-line drugs as per the result of in vitro drug susceptibility testing (DST). We aimed to establish a standardized DST procedure based on quantitative determination of drug resistance and compared the results with those of genotypes associated with drug resistance. Methods: The protocol, based on MGIT 960 and the TB eXiST software, was evaluated in nine European reference laboratories. Resistance detection at a screening drug concentration was followed by determination of resistance levels and estimation of the resistance proportion. Mutations in 14 gene regions were investigated using established techniques. Results: A total of 139 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from patients with MDR-TB and resistance beyond MDR-TB were tested for 13 antituberculous drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, rifabutin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, para-aminosalicylic acid, ethionamide, amikacin, capreomycin, ofloxacin, moxifloxacin and linezolid. Concordance between phenotypic and genotypic resistance was >80%, except for ethambutol. Time to results was short (median 10 days). High-level resistance, which precludes the therapeutic use of an antituberculous drug, was observed in 49% of the isolates. The finding of a low or intermediate resistance level in 16% and 35% of the isolates, respectively, may help in designing an efficient personalized regimen for the treatment of MDR-TB patients. Conclusions: The automated DST procedure permits accurate and rapid quantitative resistance profiling of first- and second-line antituberculous drugs. Prospective validation is warranted to determine the impact on patient care.	antibiotic susceptibility testing; DST; antituberculous drugs; TB eXiST; MGIT	DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; 2ND-LINE DRUGS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; RAPID DETECTION; MGIT 960; STRAINS; SYSTEM; ASSAY; DISTRIBUTIONS
10.1371_journal.pone.0116795	Quantitative Drug-Susceptibility in Patients Treated for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Bangladesh: Implications for Regimen Choice	Background Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment in Bangladesh is empiric or based on qualitative drug-susceptibility testing (DST) by comparative growth in culture media with and without a single drug concentration. Methods Adult patients were enrolled throughout Bangladesh during the period of 2011-2013 at MDR-TB treatment initiation. Quantitative DST by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing for 12 first and second-line anti-TB drugs was compared to pretreatment clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes. MIC values at or one dilution lower than the resistance breakpoint used for qualitative DST were categorized as borderline susceptible, and MIC values one or two dilutions greater as borderline resistant. Results Seventy-four patients were enrolled with a mean age of 35 +/- 15 years, and 51 (69%) were men. Of the rifampin isolates with MIC > 1.0 mu g/ml, 12 (19%) were fully susceptible or borderline susceptible to rifabutin (MIC <= 0.5 mu g/ml). Amikacin was fully susceptible in 73 isolates (99%), but kanamycin in only 54 (75%) (p<0.001). Ofloxacin was borderline susceptible in 64%, and fully susceptible in only 14 (19%) compared to 60 (81%) of isolates fully susceptible for moxifloxacin (p<0.001). Kanamycin non-susceptibility and receipt of the WHO Category IV regimen trended with interim treatment failure: adjusted odd ratios respectively of 5.4 [95% CI 0.82-36.2] (p = 0.08) and 7.2 [0.64-80.7] (p = 0.11). Conclusions Quantitative MIC testing could impact MDR-TB regimen choice in Bangladesh. Comparative trials of higher dose or later generation fluoroquinolone, within class change from kanamycin to amikacin, and inclusion of rifabutin appear warranted.

10.1371_journal.pone.0117361	The Burden of MDR/XDR Tuberculosis in Coastal Plains Population of China	Background We conducted a first baseline survey in Jilin Province of China to determine the proportion of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), and to analyze risk factors associated with the emergence of drug-resistance. Methodology/Principal Findings Thirty counties in Jilin Province were randomly selected as survey sites using a stratified cluster sampling method. People enrolled in the survey were new and re-treated, smear-positive pulmonary TB patients newly enrolled in local TB control and prevention institutions during the survey period. Sputum samples were collected, and the susceptibility of bacterial strains to anti-TB drugs was analyzed by proportion method. Based on the survey results, we estimated the number of drug-resistant TB patients and analyzed the risk factors associated with the emergence of drug resistance. Of 1,174 new TB patients and 597 re-treated TB patients, 8.6% and 23.2% were multi-drug resistant (MDR)-TB patients, respectively. Approximately 12% of MDR-TB patients were extensively drug-resistant. We estimate that approximately 1,290 new MDR-TB cases develop in Jilin Province every year. Of these, 810 cases would be new patients, and 480 cases would involve re-treated patients. Risk factors associated with MDR-TB include employment status, educational background, and income level. Conclusions/Significance Jilin Province remains one of the highest-burden areas in China for drug-resistant TB. The higher number of MDR-TB among new cases suggested that the transmission of drug-resistant strains in Jilin is an urgent problem in the MDR-TB control and prevention system of Jilin Province. Improving the treatment compliance of TB patients and the quality of medical care in public health institutions is urgently needed.

10.1371_journal.pone.0118191	Low Resistance to First and Second Line Anti-Tuberculosis Drugs among Treatment Naive Pulmonary Tuberculosis Patients in Southwestern Uganda	Background There are limited data on region-specific drug susceptibility of tuberculosis (TB) in Uganda. We performed resistance testing on specimens collected from treatment-naive patients with pulmonary TB in Southwestern Uganda for first and second line anti-TB drugs. We sought to provide data to guide regional recommendations for empiric TB therapy. Methods Archived isolates, obtained from patients at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital from February 2009 to February 2013, were tested for resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin using the MTBDRplus and Xpert MTB/RIF assays. A subset of randomly selected isolates was tested for second line agents, including fluoroquinolones (FQs), aminoglycosides, cyclic peptides, and ethambutol using the MTBDRs/assay. We performed confirmatory testing for FQ resistance using repeated MTBDRs/, the Mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) assay, and sequencing of the gyrA and gyrB genes. Results We tested isolates from 190 patients. The cohort had a median age of 33 years (IQR 2643), 69% (131/190) were male, and the HIV prevalence was 42% (80/190). No isolates (0/190) were rifampicin-resistant and only 1/190 (0.5%) was isoniazid-resistant. Among 92 isolates tested for second-line drug resistance, 71 (77%) had interpretable results, of which none were resistant to aminoglycosides, cyclic peptides or ethambutol. Although 7 (10%) initially tested as resistant to FQs by the MTBDRs/assay, they were confirmed as susceptible by repeat MTBDRs/testing as well as by MGIT and gyrase gene sequencing. Conclusion We found no MDR-TB and no resistance to ethambutol, FQs, or injectable anti-TB drugs in treatment naive patients with pulmonary TB in Southwestern Uganda. Standard treatment guidelines for susceptible TB should be adequate for most patients with TB in this population. Where possible, molecular susceptibility testing methods should be routinely validated by culture methods.		MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS
10.1016_j.arcmed.2015.01.006	Diabetes and Other Risk Factors for Multi-drug Resistant Tuberculosis in a Mexican Population with Pulmonary Tuberculosis: Case Control Study	Background and Aims. Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) poses problems in treatment, costs and treatment outcomes. It is not known if classically described risk factors for MDR-TB in other countries are the same in Mexico and the frequency of the association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and MDR-TB in our country is not clear. We undertook this study to analyze risk factors associated with the development of MDR-TB, with emphasis on DM. Methods. A case-control study in the state of San Luis Potosi (SLP), Mexico was carried out. All pulmonary MDR-TB patients diagnosed in the state of SLP between 1998 and 2013 (36 cases) evaluated at a state pharmacoresistant tuberculosis (TB) clinic and committee; 139 controls were randomly selected from all pulmonary non-multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (non-MDR-TB) cases identified between 2003 and 2008. Cases and controls were diagnosed and treated under programmatic conditions. Results. Age, gender, malnutrition, being a health-care worker, HIV/AIDS status, and drug abuse were not significantly different between MDR-TB and non-MDR-TB patients. Significant differences between MDR-TB and non-MDR-TB patients were DM (47.2 vs. 28.1%; p = 0.028); previous anti-TB treatments (3 vs. 0, respectively; p <0.001), and duration of first anti-TB treatment (8 vs. 6 months, respectively; p <0.001). Conclusions. MDR-TB and DM are associated in 47.2% of MDR TB cases (17/36) in this study.

pub-0671	Diagnostic Yield of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Gene Xpert in Smear-Negative and Sputum-Scarce Pulmonary Tuberculosis	Objective: To measure the diagnostic yield of Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) gene Xpert (Xpert MTB/RIF assay), to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and rifampicin resistance and compare it with that of mycobacterial cultures in a suspected case of pulmonary tuberculosis. Study Design: An analytical study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Pulmonology, Fauji Foundation Hospital (FFH), Rawalpindi, from December 2012 to August 2013. Methodology: BAL specimens of 93 patients with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis with smear-negative or sputum-scarce disease, who presented to the Department of Pulmonology, FFH, Rawalpindi were inducted. A smear-negative case was one in whom three consecutive early morning sputum samples did not reveal acid fast bacilli when examined by microscopy with Zeihl Nelson (ZN) stain. Patients who had sputum amount less than 1 ml were defined to have sputum-scarce disease. The same was evaluated with ZN stain, gene Xpert and mycobacterial cultures. Sensitivity analysis was carried out using culture as the gold standard. Results: The frequency of positive mycobacterial cultures was 85 (91.4%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values of BAL gene Xpert to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis were 91.86%, 71.42%, 97.53% and 41.66% respectively. Xpert MTB/RIF assay had a sensitivity and specificity of 83.33% and 100% to detect rifampicin resistance. Conclusion: Bronchoalveolar lavage gene Xpert had a superior diagnostic yield in patients with either smear-negative or sputum-scarce pulmonary tuberculosis. Hence a positive Xpert MTB/RIF assay may be a useful adjunct to diagnosis and detection of MDR-TB in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens.

10.1358_dot.2015.51.2.2245645	DELAWANID FOR THE TREATMENT OF PULMONARY MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS	Out of a handful of new drugs currently in clinical trials for the treatment of tuberculosis, delamanid, a nitro-dihydroimidazole derivative, has successfully emerged. Delamanid is a novel mycolic acid biosynthesis inhibitor that is equally potent against drug-sensitive as well as drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. One of the strongest points for delamanid is its inability to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, making it a promising candidate to be used in combination therapies for the treatment of tuberculosis and HIV Additionally, it has successfully completed phase II efficacy trials and has received conditional marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency.

pub-0673	TUBERCULOSIS AND RIFAMPICIN RESISTANCE AMONG MIGRANTS IN KYRGYZSTAN: DETECTION BY A NEW DIAGNOSTIC TEST	This cross-sectional study aimed to describe suspected tuberculosis (TB) cases among migrants in Kyrgyzstan and to estimate the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF, which has been operated in Kyrgyzstan since 2012. Characteristics of 3,714 suspected cases among migrants were analysed. In addition, by using data of 300 cases with culture results, sensitivity and specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF, both for detection of TB and rifampicin susceptibility, were assessed. Among 3,714 suspected cases, 56.1% were male, and the median age was 35 years old. Of the suspected cases, 17.2% were previously-treated. In total, 809 (21.8%) were smear-positive; 36.8% among previously-treated cases and 18.7% among new cases. Among 300 selected participants, 235 (78.3%) were culture-positive. Of those who were confirmed as TB positive, recurrent cases showed a higher proportion of rifampicin resistance than new cases (59.3% vs 42.6%). For detection of TB, the sensitivity and specificity of XpertMTB/RIF (81.3% and 98.2%) were higher than those of microscopy (70.2% and 71.4%). Sensitivity and specificity for detection of rifampicin resistance were 96.8% and 91.8%, respectively. The rifampicin resistance rate in the study population was higher than the national average. Xpert MTB/RIF showed higher accuracy in detecting TB cases than microscopic diagnosis. Higher accuracy and earlier detection of drug susceptibility is especially important for those who have difficulty in accessing healthcare and those who are easily lost from tracking, including migrants.

10.1016_j.pneumo.2014.11.002	Clinical, microbiological and evolutionary profile of patients experiencing failures and relapses of tuberculosis in Ivory Coast	Introduction. - Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major obsession for TB control. The main risk factor for MDR-TB remains a history of TB treatment especially bad conduct. The objective of this study is to describe the profile of patients in situations of failure and relapse of tuberculosis. Methods. - We performed a retrospective survey of the analysis of records of patients starting TB retreatment for failure or relapse of tuberculosis. We used 193 cases with results of culture-sensitivity. Results. - The proportion of failure is 59/193 (30.6%) and cases of relapse are 134/193 (69.4 %). The proportion of married life is 23.4% (11/47) in chess against 41.5% (51/123) in relapse of TB [P=0.021. OR=0.431 (0.201 to 0.927)]. Patients failing therapy have more chest pain [5.8% (3/52) versus 0% (0/126) with P=0.024]. The proportion of MDR-TB was 61.4 (38/59) in case of failure against 41% (55/134) in case of relapse [P=0.002, OR = 2.599 (1.378 to 4.902)]. The evolution is the same whatever the indication of reprocessing. Conclusion. - The proportion of MDR-TB is very important in case of reprocessing failure and relapse of tuberculosis.

10.1093_jac_dku384	Evaluation of the microscopic observation drug susceptibility assay for the rapid detection of MDR-TB and XDR-TB in China: a prospective multicentre study	Objectives: To perform a multicentre study evaluating the performance of the microscopic observation drug susceptibility (MODS) assay for the detection of MDR-TB and XDR-TB in high-burden resource-limited settings. Methods: We performed a prospective diagnostic accuracy study of drug-resistant TB suspects from outpatient and inpatient settings in five laboratories in China. Sputum was tested by smear microscopy, liquid [mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT)] culture and the MODS assay at each site. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was by MODS and an indirect 1% proportion method. The reference standard for Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection was growth on MGIT culture; the 1% proportion method was the reference standard for rifampicin, isoniazid, ofloxacin, kanamycin and capreomycin DST. Results: M. tuberculosis was identified by reference standard culture among 213/532 (40.0%) drug-resistant TB suspects. Overall MODS sensitivity for M. tuberculosis detection was 87.8%-94.3% and specificity was 96.8%-100%. For drug-resistant TB diagnosis, excellent agreement was obtained for all drugs tested at the majority of sites. The accuracy was 87.1%-96.7% for rifampicin, 87.1%-93.3% for isoniazid, 92.7%-100% for ofloxacin, 90.9%-100% for kanamycin and 90.2%-100% for capreomycin. The median time to culture positivity was significantly shorter for MODS than for the MGIT liquid culture (8 days versus 11 days, P<0.001). The contamination rate ranged between 2.1% and 5.3%. Conclusions: In the study settings, MODS provided high sensitivity and specificity for rapid diagnosis of TB and drug-resistant TB. We consider it to have a strong potential for timely detection of MDR-TB and XDR-TB in high-burden resource-limited settings.	tuberculosis; diagnosis; drug resistance; second-line drugs	NITRATE REDUCTASE ASSAY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; 2ND-LINE DRUGS; MODS ASSAY; MGIT 960; DIAGNOSIS; PERFORMANCE
10.4103_0255_0857.150879	Early detection of multi-drug resistance and common mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Delhi using GenoType MTBDRplus assay	Purpose: There is scarcity of prevalence data of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) data and common mutations responsible in North India. This study aimed to detect MDR-TB among MDR-TB suspects from Delhi and mutation patterns using GenoType MTBDRplus assay. Materials and Methods: All MDR suspects in five districts of New Delhi were referred to the laboratory from 1st October 2011 to 31st December 2012 as per criterion defined by Programmatic Management of Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (PMDT). GenoType MTBDRplus assay was performed on 2182 samples or cultures and mutations in the rpoB gene for rifampicin (RIF) and katG and inhA genes for isoniazid (INH) were analyzed. Results: A total of 366 (16.8%) MDR-TB cases were diagnosed. MDR rate was found to be 32%, 16.6% and 10.2% during criterion A, B and C respectively. The most common mutation detected for RIF was S531L (59.0%) and for INH was S315T1 (88.3%). Mutations S531L and S315T1 occurred significantly higher in MDR strains as compared to RIF mono-resistant and INH mono-resistant strains, respectively. Average laboratory turn-around time (TAT) for dispatch of result to districts for test conducted on samples was 4.4 days. Conclusion: GenoType MTBDRplus is a useful assay for rapid detection of MDR-TB. The common mutations for RIF and INH were similar to those seen in other regions. However, mutations determining MDR strains and mono-resistant strains differed significantly for both RIF and INH.

10.4269_ajtmh.13_0717	Comparing Risk Factors for Primary Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis and Primary Drug-Susceptible Tuberculosis in Jiangsu Province, China: A Matched-Pairs Case-Control Study	To find out the reason why some people get infected directly with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), whereas some get infected with drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB), a 1:1:1 matched-pairs case-control study was conducted to identify predictors associated with primary MDR-TB and primary DS-TB against the control in Jiangsu Province, China. All three groups were geographically matched (by neighborhood) and matched on sex and age ( 5 years). In total, 110 participants were enrolled in each of three matched groups. Conditional logistic regression analysis showed that predictors independently associated with primary MDR-TB were illiteracy or primary school education, annual per capita income <= US$2,000, per capita living space <40 m(2), and interval >= 7 days of eating fruits; predictors with primary DS-TB were body mass index 20 and feeling higher life pressure. This indicates that there are different predictors impacting the transmission range of primary MDR-TB and primary DS-TB in the general population.

10.1016_j.ijid.2014.09.011	A feasibility study of the Xpert MTB/RIF test at the peripheral level laboratory in China	Objective: To evaluate the performance of Xpert MTB/RIF (MTB/RIF) in the county-level tuberculosis (TB) laboratory in China. Methods: From April 2011 to January 2012, patients with suspected multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and non-MDR-TB were enrolled consecutively from four county-level TB laboratories. The detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) by MTB/RIF was compared to detection by LowensteinJensen culture. The detection of rifampin resistance was compared to detection by conventional drugsusceptibility testing. The impact of multiple specimens on the performance of MTB/RIF was also evaluated. Results: A total of 2142 suspected non-MDR-TB cases and 312 suspected MDR-TB cases were enrolled. For MTB detection in suspected non-MDR-TB cases, the sensitivity and specificity of MTB/RIF were 94.4% and 90.2%, respectively. The sensitivity in smear-negative patients was 88.8%. For the detection of rifampin resistance in suspected non-MDR-TB cases, the sensitivity and specificity of MTB/RIF were 87.1% and 97.9%, respectively. For the detection of rifampin resistance in suspected MDR-TB cases, the sensitivity and specificity of MTB/RIF were 87.1% and 91.0%, respectively. Using multiple sputum specimens had no significant influence on the performance of MTB/RIF for MTB detection. Conclusions: The introduction of MTB/RIF could increase the accuracy of detection of MTB and rifampin resistance in peripheral-level TB laboratories in China. One single specimen is adequate for TB diagnosis by MTB/RIF. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

10.5588_ijtld.14.0200	Anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in Bangladesh: reflections from the first nationwide survey	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) drug resistance in Bangladesh. DESIGN: Weighted cluster sampling among smear-positive cases, and standard culture and drug susceptibility testing on solid medium were used. RESULTS: Of 1480 patients enrolled during 2011, 12 falsified multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients were excluded. Analysis included 1340 cases (90.5% of those enrolled) with valid results and known treatment antecedents. Of 1049 new cases, 12.3% (95%CI 9.3-16.1) had strains resistant to any of the first-line drugs tested, and 1.4% (95%CI 0.7-2.5) were MDR-TB. Among the 291 previously treated cases, this was respectively 43.2% (95%CI 37.1-49.5) and 28.5% (95%CI 23.5-34.1). History of previous anti-tuberculosis treatment was the only predictive factor for first-line drug resistance (OR 34.9). Among the MDR-TB patients, 19.2% (95%CI 11.3-30.5; exclusively previously treated) also showed resistance to ofloxacin. Resistance to kanamycin was not detected. CONCLUSION: Although MDR-TB prevalence was relatively low, transmission of MDR-TB may be increasing in Bangladesh. MDR-TB with fluoroquinolone resistance is rapidly rising. Integrating the private sector should be made high priority given the excessive proportion of MDR-TB retreatment cases in large cities. TB control programmes and donors should avoid applying undue pressure towards meeting global targets, which can lead to corruption of data even in national surveys.	prevalence; drug resistance; tuberculosis; survey; Bangladesh	TUBERCULOSIS-CONTROL
10.5588_ijtld.13.0905	Nationwide survey of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in Japan	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in Japan. DESIGN: A nationwide drug resistance survey was conducted by convenience sampling based on a voluntary hospital consortium. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates (n = 2292) were collected from August 2007 to July 2008. Drug susceptibilities were analysed according to the patients' treatment history, age, sex, comorbidities and residential area. We determined susceptibility to the following drugs: isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP), streptomycin (SM), ethambutol (EMB) and levofloxacin (LVX). RESULTS: The frequencies of drug-resistant isolates from new cases were as follows: INH, 3.1%; RMP, 0.7%; SM, 5.6%; EMB, 1.3%; and 8.5% to any drug. The frequencies of drug-resistant isolates from previously treated patients were as follows: INH, 12.3%; RMP, 6.7%; SM, 12.3%; and EMB, 2.6%. The frequencies of LVX-resistant isolates from new and previously treated patients were respectively 3.2% and 6.1% (n = 852). The frequencies of multidrug-resistant isolates from new and previously treated patients were respectively 0.4% and 4.1%, with only one extensively drug-resistant case. CONCLUSION: In general, the prevalence of drug-resistant TB in Japan during this period was low. However, LVX resistance among new patients was relatively high. Japan should establish a nationwide surveillance system.	tuberculosis; MDR-TB; drug susceptibility testing	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; STRAINS
10.5588_ijtld.14.0421	Impact of reduced hospitalisation on the cost of treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa	SETTING: The cost of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment is a major barrier to treatment scale-up in South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To estimate and compare the cost of treatment for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) in South Africa in different models of care in different settings. DESIGN: We estimated the costs of different models of care with varying levels of hospitalisation. These costs were used to calculate the total cost of treating all diagnosed cases of RR-TB in South Africa, and to estimate the budget impact of adopting a fully or partially decentralised model vs. a fully hospitalised model. RESULTS: The fully hospitalised model was 42% more costly than the fully decentralised model (US$13 432 vs. US$7753 per patient). A much shorter hospital stay in the decentralised models of care (44-57 days), compared to 128 days of hospitalisation in the fully hospitalised model, was the key contributor to the reduced cost of treatment. The annual total cost of treating all diagnosed cases ranged from US$110 million in the fully decentralised model to US$190 million in the fully hospitalised model. CONCLUSION: Following a more decentralised approach for treating RR-TB patients could potentially improve the affordability of RR-TB treatment in South Africa.

10.3109_09273948.2013.874447	Optic Neuropathy Secondary to Linezolid for Multidrug-resistant Mycobacterial Spinal Tuberculosis	Aim: To report a case of optic neuropathy secondary to Linezolid, second line anti tuberculosis agent. Case Report: 22 year Indian male with multidrug resistant spinal tuberculosis and TB meningitis was started on second line anti tuberculosis drugs. Within one month of onset of second line anti TB drug, he was noted to have optic neuropathy in both eyes. Visual field and electro diagnostics suggested optic neuropathy. Discussion: Linezolid is a synthetic oxazolidinone broad spectrum antibiotic and has been in off label use for multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). There are very scattered case reports of optic neuropathy secondary to use of this off label drug. In our case, the optic neuropathy was however reversible on stoppage of the drug. Conclusion: It seems prudent that baseline ophthalmological evaluation to be done for all patients to be subjected for treatment with this drug for any short term or long term therapy.

10.5588_ijtld.14.0369	Community-based care vs. centralised hospitalisation for MDR-TB patients, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa	SETTING: KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, a predominantly rural province with a high burden of tuberculosis (TB), multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. OBJECTIVE: To determine the most effective care model by comparing MDR-TB treatment outcomes at community-based sites with traditional care at a central, specialised hospital. DESIGN: A non-randomised observational prospective cohort study comparing community-based and centralised care. Patients at community-based sites were closer to home and had easier access to care, and home-based care was available from treatment initiation. RESULTS: Four community-based sites treated 736 patients, while 813 were treated at the centralised hospital (total = 1549 patients). Overall, 75% were HIV co-infected (community: 76% vs. hospitalised: 73%, P = 0.45) and 86% received antiretroviral therapy (community: 91% vs. hospitalised: 82%, P = 0.22). On multivariate analysis, MDR-TB patients were more likely to have a successful treatment outcome if they were treated at a community-based site (adjusted OR 1.43, P = 0.01). However, outcomes at the four community-based sites were heterogeneous, with Site 1 demonstrating that home-based care was associated with an increased treatment success of 72% compared with success rates of 52-60% at the other three sites. CONCLUSION: Community-based care for MDR-TB patients was more effective than care in a central, specialised hospital. Home-based care further increased treatment success.	models of care; HIV; outcomes	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; HEALTH SYSTEMS; FOLLOW-UP; HIV; METAANALYSIS; INITIATION; MORTALITY; SETTINGS; PROGRAMS; THERAPY
10.1186_s12889_015_1376_3	Tuberculosis risk factors among tuberculosis patients in Kampala, Uganda: implications for tuberculosis control	Background: Slow decline in the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) has been observed in most high TB burden countries. Knowledge of the prevalence of different TB risk factors can help expand TB control strategies. However with the exception of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) the prevalence of the other TB risk factors are poorly studied in Uganda. We aimed to determine the prevalence of different TB risk factors and TB disease presentation among TB patients in Kampala Uganda. Methods: We assessed 365 adult TB patients and used descriptive statistics to summarize their socio-demographic, clinical, radiological, sputum mycobacteriology and TB risk factors (HIV, diabetes, TB contact, alcohol use, tobacco smoking, poverty and overcrowding) data. Results: A total of 158 (43.3%) patients were male and the median age was 29 (IQR 28-30). Majority of the patients (89.2%) had pulmonary TB, 86.9% were new and 13.2% were retreatment. Wasting (i.e. body mass index of <18.5 kg/m(2)) was found in 38.5% of the patients and 63% presented with cough. Constitutional symptoms (fever, anorexia, night sweats and weight loss) were reported by 32.1%. Most patients (78.6%) presented with non-cavity lung parenchyma disease (infiltrates, nodules, masses) but 35.2% had cavity disease. Pleural disease was detected in 19.3% of patients. Positive smear microscopy and culture (irrespective of month of treatment) was found in 52.7% and 36.5% of patients respectively. Any drug resistance was detected in 21.1% of patients while multidrug resistance (MDR) TB defined as resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid was detected in 6.3% of patients. All MDR patients were new patients. The prevalence of TB risk factors were as follows: HIV 41.4%, diabetes 5.4%, close contact 11.5%, family history 17.5%, smoking 26.37%, poverty 39.5%, overcrowding 57.3% and alcohol use 50.7%. Overcrowding increased smear positive rate, prevalence ratio 1.22, p = 0.09 but all the other studied risk factors did not affect clinical, radiological and mycobacteriological study patient characteristics. Conclusions: Among TB patients in Kampala, Uganda, there is high prevalence of the known TB risk factors. Targeting reducing their prevalence may lead to better TB control in the country.

10.1371_journal.pone.0116798	Resistance Patterns among Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients in Greater Metropolitan Mumbai: Trends over Time	Background While the high burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) itself is a matter of great concern, the emergence and rise of advanced forms of drug-resistance such as extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) and extremely drug-resistant TB (XXDR-TB) is more troubling. The aim of this study was to investigate the trends over time of patterns of drug resistance in a sample of MDR-TB patients in greater metropolitan Mumbai, India. Methods This was a retrospective, observational study of drug susceptibility testing (DST) results among MDR-TB patients from eight health care facilities in greater Mumbai between 2005 and 2013. We classified resistance patterns into four categories: MDR-TB, pre-XDR-TB, XDR-TB and XXDR-TB. Results A total of 340 MDR-TB patients were included in the study. Pre-XDR-TB was the most common form of drug-resistant TB observed overall in this Mumbai population at 56.8% compared to 29.4% for MDR-TB. The proportion of patients with MDR-TB was 39.4% in the period 2005-2007 and 27.8% in 2011-2013, while the proportion of those with XDR-TB and XXDR-TB was changed from 6.1% and 0% respectively to 10.6% and 5.6% during the same time period. During the same periods, the proportions of patients with ofloxacin, moxifloxacin and ethionamide resistance significantly increased from 57.6% to 75.3%, from 60.0% to 69.5% and from 24.2% to 52.5% respectively (p<0.05). Discussion The observed trends in TB drug-resistance patterns in Mumbai highlight the need for individualized drug regimens, designed on the basis of DST results involving first- and second-line anti-TB drugs and treatment history of the patient. A drug-resistant TB case-finding strategy based on molecular techniques that identify only rifampicin resistance will lead to initiation of suboptimal treatment regimens for a significant number of patients, which may in turn contribute to amplification of resistance and transmission of strains with increasingly advanced resistance within the community.

10.1126_scitranslmed.3010597	Direct inhibitors of InhA are active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis	New chemotherapeutic agents are urgently required to combat the global spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The mycobacterial enoyl reductase InhA is one of the few clinically validated targets in tuberculosis drug discovery. We report the identification of a new class of direct InhA inhibitors, the 4-hydroxy-2-pyridones, using phenotypic high-throughput whole-cell screening. This class of orally active compounds showed potent bactericidal activity against common isoniazid-resistant TB clinical isolates. Biophysical studies revealed that 4-hydroxy-2-pyridones bound specifically to InhA in an NADH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)-dependent manner and blocked the enoyl substrate-binding pocket. The lead compound NITD-916 directly blocked InhA in a dose-dependent manner and showed in vivo efficacy in acute and established mouse models of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Collectively, our structural and biochemical data open up new avenues for rational structure-guided optimization of the 4-hydroxy-2-pyridone class of compounds for the treatment of MDR-TB.

10.1016_j.ejmech.2014.10.026	Antimycobacterial activity of natural products and synthetic agents: Pyrrolodiquinolines and vermelhotin as anti-tubercular leads against clinical multidrug resistant isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Various classes of natural products and synthetic compounds were tested against reference strains and clinical multidrug resistant isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Vermelhotin (19), a natural tetramic acid from fungi, was the most active toward clinical MDR TB isolates (MIC 1.5-12.5 mu g/mL). Synthetic compounds (i.e. benzoxazocines, coumarins, chromenes, and pyrrolodiquinoline derivatives) were prepared by green chemistry approaches. Under microwave irradiation, a one-pot synthesis of pyrrolodiquinoline 85 was achieved by homocoupling of 1-methylquinolinium iodide; the structure of 85 was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Compound 85 and its derivative 86 exhibited potent antitubercular activity (MIC 0.3-6.2 mu g/mL) against clinical MDR TB isolates, and they displayed weak cytotoxicity toward normal cell line. The scaffold of 85 and 86 is potential for antimycobacterial activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

10.2174_1389200216666151001121004	Linezolid Induced Adverse Drug Reactions - An Update	Treatment regimen recommended for resistant tuberculosis consists of various drugs and these drugs are prescribed for at least 12-15 months. Such a long duration therapy and high dose of antibiotics result in adverse drug reactions (ADRs). ADRs may lead to various complications in disease management like replacement of drugs, dose increment, therapy withdrawal, etc. Linezolid is one of those drugs, practiced as an anti-mycobacterial agent and it is an important member of drug regimen for MDR and XDR tuberculosis. Linezolid is a broad spectrum antibiotic known for its unique mechanism of inhibition of resistant pathogenic strains. However, it causes serious adverse effects like thrombocytopenia, optic neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, lactic acidosis, etc. Literature suggests that Linezolid can cause severe ADRs which affect patient compliance and hinder in therapy to a larger extent. Recent studies confirm the possibility of ADRs to be predicted with genetic make-up of individuals. To effectively deliver the available treatment regimen and ensure patient compliance, it is important to manage ADRs more efficiently.

10.3402_gha.v8.29019	Psychological distress and its effect on tuberculosis treatment outcomes in Ethiopia	Background: Psychological distress is the major comorbidity among tuberculosis (TB) patients. However, its magnitude, associated factors, and effect on treatment outcome have not been adequately studied in low-income countries. Objective: This study aimed to determine the magnitude of psychological distress and its effect on treatment outcome among TB patients on treatment. Design: A follow-up study was conducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from May to December 2014. Patients (N = 330) diagnosed with all types of TB who had been on treatment for 1-2 months were enrolled consecutively from 15 randomly selected health centers and one TB specialized hospital. Data on socio-demographic variables and economic status were collected using a structured questionnaire. The presence of psychological distress was assessed at baseline (within 1-2 months after treatment initiation) and end point (6 months after treatment initiation) using the 10-item Kessler (K-10) scale. Alcohol use and tobacco smoking history were assessed using WHO Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test and Australian Smoking Assessment Checklist, respectively. The current WHO TB treatment outcome definition was used to differentiate the end result of each patient at completion of the treatment. Results: The overall psychological distress was 67.6% at 1-2 months and 48.5% at 6 months after treatment initiation. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that past TB treatment history [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 3.76; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.67-8.45], being on anti-TB and anti-HIV treatments (AOR: 5.35; 95% CI: 1.83-15.65), being unmarried (AOR: 4.29; 95% CI: 2.45-7.53), having alcohol use disorder (AOR: 2.95; 95% CI: 1.25-6.99), and having low economic status (AOR: 4.41; 95% CI: 2.44-7.97) were significantly associated with psychological distress at baseline. However, at 6 months after treatment initiation, only being a multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patient (AOR: 3.02; 95% CI: 1.17-7.75) and having low economic status (AOR: 3.75; 95% CI: 2.08-6.74) were able to predict psychological distress significantly. Past TB treatment history (AOR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.10-4.12), employment status (AOR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.06-7.00), and existence of psychological distress symptoms at 6 months after treatment initiation (AOR: 2.87; 95% CI: 1.05-7.81) were found to be associated with treatment outcome. Conclusions: The overall magnitude of psychological distress was high across the follow-up period; this was more pronounced at baseline. At baseline, past TB treatment history, being on anti-TB and anti-HIV treatments, being unmarried, and having symptoms of alcohol use disorder were associated with psychological distress. However, both at baseline and end point, low economic status was associated with psychological distress. Screening and treatment of psychological distress among TB patients across the whole treatment period is needed, and focusing more on patients who have been economically deprived, previously treated for TB, and on MDR-TB treatment are important.	psychological distress; treatment outcome; psychological distress trend; tuberculosis	PUBLIC PRIMARY-CARE; SOUTH-AFRICA; MENTAL-ILLNESS; MEDICATION ADHERENCE; UNITED-STATES; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; DEPRESSION; HEALTH; HIV
pub-0691	Pyrosequencing analysis for mutations in embB codon306 among clinical mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Qingdao, China	In this study, our objectives was to analyze the molecular characteristics of mutation at embB codon306 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Qingdao by pyrosequencing technology, and to assess the value of embB codon306 used as a molecular marker to diagnose multidrug resistant (MDR) TB strains. Pyrosequencing was used to detect mutations at embB codon306 among M. tuberculosis isolates from tuberculosis (TB) patients in Qingdao. The correlation between embB306 mutation and MDR phenotype was evaluated by comparing with conventional drug susceptibility testing results. 60.9% of MDR strains and 15.2% of non-MDR strains carried embB306 mutation, respectively. The percentage of MDR-TB harboring embB306 mutation was significantly higher than that of non-MDR-TB (chi(2)= 15.09, P < 0.01). EmbB306 mutation serving as a marker to diagnose MDR-TB comparing with the traditional susceptibility test, the specificity, sensitivity and accuracy were 85%, 61%, and 77%, respectively. EmbB306 mutation is the main mechanism of TB resistance to multidrug in Qingdao, showing an association with the MDR. Pyrosequencing should be a good diagnostic tool for MDR-TB in Qingdao.

10.1136_bmjopen_2015_008273	Factors related to previous tuberculosis treatment of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Bangladesh	Objective: Previous tuberculosis (TB) treatment status is an established risk factor for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). This study explores which factors related to previous TB treatment may lead to the development of multidrug resistant in Bangladesh. Design: We previously conducted a large case-control study to identify risk factors for developing MDR-TB in Bangladesh. Patients who had a history of previous TB treatment, either MDR-TB or non-MDRTB, were interviewed about their previous treatment episode. This study restricts analysis to the strata of patients who have been previously treated for TB. Information was collected through face-to-face interviews and record reviews. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression was used for data analysis. Setting: Central-level, district-level and subdistrict-level hospitals in rural and urban Bangladesh. Results: The strata of previously treated patients include a total of 293 patients (245 current MDR-TB; 48 non-MDR-TB). Overall, 54% of patients received previous TB treatment more than once, and all of these patients were multidrug resistant. Patients with MDR-TB were more likely to have experienced the following factors: incomplete treatment (OR 4.3; 95% CI 1.7 to 10.6), adverse reactions due to TB treatment (OR 8.2; 95% CI 3.2 to 20.7), hospitalisation for symptoms associated with TB (OR 16.9; CI 1.8 to 156.2), DOTS (directly observed treatment, shortcourse) centre as treatment unit (OR 6.4; CI 1.8 to 22.8), supervised treatment (OR 3.8; CI 1.6 to 9.5); time-to-treatment centre (OR 0.984; CI 0.974 to 0.993). Conclusions: Incomplete treatment, hospitalisation for TB treatment and adverse reaction are the factors related to previous TB treatment of patients with MDR-TB. Although the presence of supervised treatment (DOT), less time-to-treatment centres and being treated in DOTS centres were relatively higher among the patients with MDR-TB compared with patients without MDR-TB, these findings include information of their most recent TB treatment episode only. Most (64.5%) of the patients with MDR-TB had received TB treatment more than once.		RISK-FACTORS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; PHILIPPINES; PREVALENCE
10.5114_aoms.2015.52362	The beneficial effects of adjunctive recombinant human interleukin-2 for multidrug resistant tuberculosis	Introduction: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a hard-to-treat disease with a poor outcome of chemotherapy. In the present study, the efficacy and safety of recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) were investigated in patients with MDR-TB. Material and methods: Fifty culture-confirmed patients with MDR-TB were included. Twenty-five patients were randomly assigned to the trial group (injection of 500 000 IU of rhIL-2 once every other day at the first, third, fifth and seventh months in addition to standard multidrug therapy) and another 25 patients to the control group with standard multidrug therapy. All patients were monitored clinically, and T-cell subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: The rates of sputum negative conversion and X-ray resolution in the trial group were higher than those of the control, and the improvements were significant by completion of treatment. In addition, CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells in the controls rose gradually during treatment. The levels at the end of the seventh month were significantly higher than before, which were also significantly different when compared with those from the trial group at the same time. However, there were no such changes associated with treatment in the trial group. No significant differences appeared in other T cell subsets. Conclusions: Exogenous IL-2 in the present regimen improves immunity status. Adjunctive immunotherapy with a long period of rhIL-2 is a promising treatment modality for MDR-TB.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; immunotherapy; interleukin-2; CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells	REGULATORY T-CELLS; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; ACTIVE TUBERCULOSIS; IN-VIVO; IL-2; IMMUNOTHERAPY; ANTIGENS; THERAPY; BLOOD
10.1093_femsle_fnu037	A proportion of mutations fixed in the genomes of in vitro selected isogenic drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutants can be detected as minority variants in the parent culture	We studied genomic variation in a previously selected collection of isogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis laboratory strains subjected to one or two rounds of antibiotic selection. Whole genome sequencing analysis identified eleven single, unique mutations (four synonymous, six non-synonymous, one intergenic), in addition to drug resistance-conferring mutations, that were fixed in the genomes of six monoresistant strains. Eight loci, present as minority variants (five non-synonymous, three synonymous) in the genome of the susceptible parent strain, became fixed in the genomes of multiple daughter strains. None of these mutations are known to be involved with drug resistance. Our results confirm previously observed genomic stability for M. tuberculosis, although the parent strain had accumulated allelic variants at multiple locations in an antibiotic-free in vitro environment. It is therefore likely to assume that these so-called hitchhiking mutations were co-selected and fixed in multiple daughter strains during antibiotic selection. The presence of multiple allelic variations, accumulated under non-selective conditions, which become fixed during subsequent selective steps, deserves attention. The wider availability of 'deep' sequencing methods could help to detect multiple bacterial (sub) populations within patients with high resolution and would therefore be useful in assisting in the detailed investigation of transmission chains.	tuberculosis; MDR-TB; evolution; whole genome sequencing; mutation; drug resistance	POPULATION-STRUCTURE; SEQUENCING DATA; EVOLUTION; COMPLEX; FITNESS; GENE; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; TRANSMISSION; ANNOTATION; EXPRESSION
10.2174_1570162X13666150407143147	Performance of Genotype MTBDRplus in the Detection of Resistance to Rifampicin and Isoniazid Among Clinical Mycobacteria Isolates in Ilorin, Nigeria	Background: Performance of Genotype MTBDRplus assay against Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) proportion method of Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST) in detection of resistance among clinical mycobacteria isolates to rifampicin (RMP) and isoniazid (INH) was evaluated in Ilorin, Nigeria. Methods: This retrospective study characterized one hundred mycobacteria isolates from pulmonary TB patients, stored on LJ medium and subcultured unto fresh LJ slants before being genotyped using MTBDRplus assay. DST was performed on the isolates against RMP, INH, Ethambutol and Streptomycin. Results: Genotype MTBDRplus identified 97% and 3% of the 100 isolates as Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex (MTBC) and Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) respectively. Fourteen of the isolates, (14%) were resistant to RMP while 86% were sensitive by the genotypic method. Three of these 14 RMP-resistant isolates were NTMs while 11 were MTBC. Twelve (12%) of the 100 isolates were resistant to INH. Three INH-resistant isolates were NTMs, and 9 were MTBC. Phenotypically and genotypically, the 3 NTMs were resistant to RMP and INH and ten of the 97 MTBC strains were RMP-resistant. One RMP-phenotypically-sensitive strain was genotypically resistant to RMP. Six of the MTBC isolates were resistant to both RMP and INH by both methods. Most mutations occurred in the S-531L and S315T1 codons of rpoB and KatG genes of RMP and INH, respectively. Conclusion: The high specificity and positive predictive values recorded by MTBDRplus in our study make it suitable for use in the programmatic management of drug-resistant TB in resource-limited settings.

10.4314_ahs.v15i2.9	Risk factors for multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients in Amhara National Regional State	Background: Multidrug resistant tuberculosis(MDR-TB) is becoming a major threat to tuberculosis control programs in Ethiopia. Objectives: To determine risk factors of MDR-TB patients in Amhara National Regional State, Ethiopia. Methods: Case-control study was conducted from May 2013 to January 2014. Resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid were done molecularly using line probe controls, respectively. Data was collected using structured questionnaire with face to face interview. Patients' clinical record review was also done. Multivariate analysis was computed to determine the risk factors of MDR-TB. Results: A total of 153 MDR-TB and equal number of non MDR-TB patients' participated in the study. Patients who had TB treatment failure (AOR=13.5, CI=2.69-70), cavitations on chest x-ray (AOR=1.9, CI=1.1-3.38) and contact with MDR-TB patients (AOR=1.4, CI=0.19-0.39) were more likely to be MDR-TB patients. Low monthly income (AOR=1.1, CI=0.34-0.47), alcohol consumption (AOR=1.5, CI=0.2-0.98) and young age (AOR=2.9, CI=1.07-7.68) were the other risk factors of MDR-TB. Conclusions: TB treatment failure, cavitation on chest X-ray, contact with MDR-TB patients and low socioeconomic status were important risk factors for development of MDR-TB. Therefore, strict adherence to directly observed therapy, appropriate management of TB patients and advice on the value of nutrients are helpful to control the spreading of MDR-TB.

pub-0697	Comparative proteomic analysis of sequential isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis turning from drug sensitive to multidrug resistant	Background & objectives: Tuberculosis is a major health problem in India, and the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has further complicated the situation. Though several studies characterizing drug sensitive and drug resistant strains are available in literature, almost all studies are done on unrelated strains. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the proteomic data of four sequential isolates of Mtb from a single patient who developed MDR-TB during the course of anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT). Methods: In this study, using two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, we compared and analyzed the cell lysate proteins of Mtb sequential clinical isolates from a patient undergoing anti-TB treatment. The mRNA expression levels of selected identified proteins were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results: The genotypes of all four isolates remained homologous, indicating no re-infection. The initial isolate (before treatment) was sensitive to all first-line drugs, but the consecutive isolates were found to be resistant to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF) and developed mutations in the katG, inhA and rpoB. the intensities of 27 protein spots were found to be consistently overexpressed in INH and RIF resistant isolates. The most prominent and overexpressed proteins found during the development of drug resistance were GarA (Rv1827), wag31 (Rv2145c), Rv1437 and Rv2970c. Interpretation & conclusions: This preliminary proteomic study provides an insight about the proteins that are upregulated during drug resistance development. These upregulated proteins, identified here, could prove useful as immunodiagnostic and possibly drug resistant markers in future. However, more studies are required to confirm these findings.	2D gel electrophoresis; tuberculosis; MDR-TB; MALDI-TOF; proteomics	PROTEIN EXPRESSION; GLYCOGEN; STRAINS; KINASES; PCR
pub-0698	Evaluation of Second-Line Antituberculosis Drug Susceptibilities of Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex Isolates by E-Test Method	Multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) constitutes a restricting factor for the effective treatment of TB worldwide. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of patients are the most effective strategy in the control of MDR-TB. Therefore, knowledge of drug resistance patterns of the MDR-TB clinical isolates are necessary in planning of an appropriate treatment regimen for the patient. The aims of this study were to detect the susceptibilities of MDR-TB isolates to second-line anti-TB drugs by E-test method, and to compare their results with Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) proportion method. A total of 122 MDR (resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin) Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) strains isolated from samples of patients with pulmonary TB were included in the study. The isolates were identified by conventional methods and first-line anti-TB drug susceptibility testing was performed by the proportion method using LJ medium. The susceptibilities of the isolates to second-line anti-TB drugs [kanamycin (KN), ofloxacin (OFL), ethionamid (ETN), linezolid (LIN)] were tested by proportion method on LJ medium and E-test method on Middlebrook 7H11 medium. For this purpose, E-test strips (bioMerieux, Fransa) of KN (0.016-256 mg/ml), OFL (0.02-32 mg/ml), ETN (0.016-256 mg/ml), and LIN (0.016-256 mg/ml) were used. The susceptibility tests were evaluated in 5., 7., and 10. days after application of the E-test strips, and proportion method on LA medium was evaluated 28 days later. Second line-anti-TB drug susceptibility results were obtained in 5 to 10 days by E-test. Of the MDR MTC strains 98% (119/122) were susceptible to KN, OFL and LIN, while 2% (3/122) of the strains were resistant to KN and ETN. The correlation between E-test and LJ proportion method was estimated as 96% for KN and ETN, 98% for OFL, and 100% for LIN. When compared with LJ proportion method, the specificity of E-test in the detection of susceptibility to KN, OFL, ETN and LIN were 60%, 38%, 60%, and 100%, respectively, while the sensitivity was 100% for all drugs. Our results indicated that E-test method exhibited high sensitivity and specificity (100%) for LIN, so it may be used alone in susceptibility testing for this drug, however since the specificity is low (38%) for OFL it should be used together with the proportion method. In conclusion, E-test method might contribute for initiation of an early and effective anti-TB drug treatment and control of infection by rapid diagnosis in MDR-TB cases.

10.1039_c5ob00054h	Synthesis of new generation triazolyl- and isoxazolyl-containing 6-nitro-2,3-dihydroimidazooxazoles as anti-TB agents: in vitro, structure-activity relationship, pharmacokinetics and in vivo evaluation	The nitroimidazole scaffold has attracted great interest in the last decade, which ultimately led to the discovery of the successful drug Delamanid for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Herein, we report medicinal chemistry on a 6-nitro-2,3-dihydroimidazooxazole (NHIO) scaffold with SAR on the novel series of triazolyl-and isoxazolyl-based NHIO compounds. In the present study, 41 novel triazolyl- and isoxazolyl-based NHIO compounds were synthesized and evaluated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) H(37)Rv. The active compounds with MIC of 0.57-0.13 mu M were further screened against dormant, as well as against resistant strains of MTB. Based on the overall in vitro profile, five compounds were studied for in vivo oral pharmacokinetics, wherein two compounds: 1g and 2e showed a good PK profile. In in vivo efficacy studies in the intra-nasal model of acute infection, 1g showed 1.8 and 1 log CFU reduction with respect to the untreated and early control, respectively. The lead compound 1g also showed an additive to synergistic effect in combination studies with first line-TB drugs and no CYP inhibition. From the present studies, the compound 1g represents another alternative lead candidate in this class and needs further detailed investigation.

10.1093_qjmed_hcu139	Isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis in Birmingham, United Kingdom, 1999-2010	Background: There have been few studies on risk factors and treatment outcomes of isoniazid (H)-resistant tuberculosis (TB), and optimal treatment regimens are debated. Aim: To identify risk factors for H-resistant TB, describe treatment regimens and compare these to national guidelines and describe short-term outcomes of H-resistant TB in Birmingham, UK. Design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Cases of H-resistant tuberculosis in Birmingham between January 1999 and December 2010 (n = 89) were compared with drug-susceptible cases (n = 2497). Treatment regimens and outcomes at 12 months from diagnosis were evaluated by case note review. Results: No independent predictors for H-resistant TB were found. For 76/89 (85%) patients with full treatment details available, median treatment duration was 11 months (interquartile range 9-12 months). Only 27/72 (38%) patients with H-monoresistance were treated in line with national guidelines. A further 14/72 (19%) were treated according to other recognized guidelines. Overall treatment success was 75/89 (84%). Treatment failure occurred in 6/89 (7%) patients, all developed multi-drug resistance. Poor adherence was documented in these patients and use of a non-standard regimen in one patient was not thought to have contributed to treatment failure. Conclusions: No discriminating risk factors for early detection of H-resistant TB were found. Treatment regimens in clinical practice were highly varied. H-resistance can drive MDR-TB when there is evidence or suspicion of poor adherence. A low threshold for enhanced case management with directly observed therapy is warranted in this group.

10.3402_gha.v8.25964	Drug-resistant tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients in a national referral hospital, Phnom Penh, Cambodia	Background and objective: There are no recent data on the prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR TB) in Cambodia. We aim to describe TB drug resistance amongst adults with pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection in a national referral hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Design: Between 22 November 2007 and 30 November 2009, clinical specimens from HIV-infected patients suspected of having TB underwent routine microscopy, Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture, and drug susceptibility testing. Laboratory and clinical data were collected for patients with positive M. tuberculosis cultures. Results: M. tuberculosis was cultured from 236 HIV-infected patients. Resistance to any first-line TB drug occurred in 34.7% of patients; 8.1% had multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). The proportion of MDR TB amongst new patients and previously treated patients was 3.7 and 28.9%, respectively (p <0.001). The diagnosis of MDR TB was made after death in 15.8% of patients; in total 26.3% of patients with MDR TB died. The diagnosis of TB was established by culture of extra-pulmonary specimens in 23.6% of cases. Conclusions: There is significant resistance to first-line TB drugs amongst new and previously treated TB-HIV co-infected patients in Phnom Penh. These data suggest that the prevalence of DR TB in Cambodia may be higher than previously recognised, particularly amongst HIV-infected patients. Additional prevalence studies are needed. This study also illustrates the feasibility and utility of analysis of non-respiratory specimens in the diagnosis of TB, even in low-resource settings, and suggests that extra-pulmonary specimens should be included in TB diagnostic algorithms.	tuberculosis; drug resistant; HIV; Cambodia	RISK-FACTORS; PREVENTION; PREVALENCE; ADULTS; CARE
10.1007_s40265_014_0331_4	Delamanid: A Review of Its Use in Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Delamanid (Deltyba (R)), a nitroimidazo-oxazole derivative, is a new anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug which exhibits potent in vitro and in vivo antitubercular activity against drug-susceptible and -resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is approved in several countries, including Japan and those of the EU, for use as part of an appropriate combination regimen in adults with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed due to resistance or tolerability. In a robust phase II trial in adult patients with MDR-TB, oral delamanid 100 mg twice daily for 2 months plus an optimized background regimen improved sputum culture conversion rates to a significantly greater extent than placebo. In a 6-month extension study, long-term (<= currency sign8 months) treatment with delamanid was associated with a higher incidence of favourable outcomes (i.e. cured or completed all treatment) than short-term (<= currency sign2 months) treatment, with an accompanying reduction inunfavourable outcomes as defined by the WHO (i.e. pre-specified proportion of TB-positive sputum cultures, death or treatment discontinuation for >= 2 months without medical approval). Delamanid was not associated with clinically relevant drug-drug interactions, including with antiretroviral drugs and those commonly used in treating TB. Delamanid was generally well tolerated in patients with MDR-TB, with gastrointestinal adverse events and insomnia reported most commonly. Although the incidence of QT interval prolongation was higher with delamanid-based therapy, it was not associated with clinical symptoms such as syncope and arrhythmia. In conclusion, delamanid is a useful addition to the treatment options currently available for patients with MDR-TB.

10.1007_s10096_014_2202_z	A close-up on the epidemiology and transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Poland	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) poses a serious challenge to the global control of the disease. The purpose of this study was to characterize MDR-TB patients from Poland and to determine the extent of MDR-TB disease attributable to recent transmission. The study included all 46 patients diagnosed with MDR-TB in Poland in 2004 and followed up for 6 years (until 2011). For each patient, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, treatment outcomes, and bacteriological data were collected by the review of medical and laboratory records. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from all patients were characterized using spoligotyping, mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing, IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, and sequencing analysis of drug resistance-associated loci (katG, mabA-inhA, rpo beta, rpsL, and embB). The majority of patients were male (86.9 %), 40-64 years of age (60.8 %), with a history of TB treatment (84.8 %), and producing smear-positive sputa (86.9 %). Twenty-two (47.8 %) patients suffered from concomitant diseases and 28 (60.8 %) were alcohol abusers. Treatment outcome assessment revealed that 8 (17.4 %) patients were cured or completed therapy, while 15 (32.6 %) died of TB, 11 (23.9 %) defaulted, 8 (17.4 %) failed, and 1 (2.2 %) was transferred and lost to follow-up. Upon genotyping, 10 (21.7 %) isolates were allocated in four clusters. These were further subdivided by mutational profiling. Overall, in 6 (13 %) patients, MDR-TB was a result of recent transmission. For 4 (8.7 %) of these patients, a direct epidemiological link was established. The study shows that the transmission of MDR-TB occurs at a low rate in Poland. Of urgent need is the implementation of a policy of enforced treatment of MDR-TB patients in Poland.

10.1016_j.ijantimicag.2014.09.012	In vitro synergistic activity of clofazimine and other antituberculous drugs against multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates	Clofazimine (CLO) is a promising candidate drug for use in the management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients. In this study, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method was used to investigate drug susceptibility to CLO as well as potential synergies between CLO and other antituberculous drugs, including ethambutol (EMB), levofloxacin (LEV), moxifloxacin (MOX), amikacin (AMK) and capreomycin (CAP), among MDR-TB isolates from China. A total of 195 MDR-TB isolates were collected from the national drug resistance survey conducted in China. Of the 195 MDR-TB isolates, 54(27.7%) were classified as CLO-resistant, whilst 141 (72.3%) were CLO-susceptible with MICs of <1 mu g/mL. In addition, the prevalence of CLO-resistant isolates among the extensively drug-resistant(XDR)-TBgroup was 61.5% (8113), which was significantly higher than that of the MDR-TB group (23.0%) (P=0.006). When fractional inhibitory concentration indexes (FICIs) were calculated for 24 isolates, synergy was found in 11 isolates (45.8%) against the CLO/EMB combination, 6(25.0%) against the CLO/LEV combination, 8(33.3%) against the CLO/MOX combination, 4(16.7%) against the CLO/AMK combination and 5(20.8%) against the CLO/CAP combination. In addition, <15% of MDR-TB isolates showed antagonistic effects against these five combinations. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that the combination of CLO and EMB shows better synergism than the other combinations containing CLO. The CLO/MOX combination is more likely to show synergy against MDR-TB isolates than the CLO/LEV combination. Taken together, we suggest that CLO, in combination with EMB or MOX, may be a promising drug regimen for the treatment of MDR-TB. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.

10.1128_JCM.02283_14	Diagnostic Value of GeneChip for Detection of Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Patients with Differing Treatment Histories	The increasing burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) poses an escalating threat to national TB control programs. To assist appropriate treatment for TB patients, accurate and rapid detection of drug resistance is critical. The GeneChip test is a novel molecular tool for the diagnosis of TB drug resistance. Performance-related data on GeneChip are limited, and evaluation in new and previously treated TB cases has never been performed. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of GeneChip in detecting resistance to rifampin (RMP) and isoniazid (INH) and in detecting multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in comparison with standard drug susceptibility testing (DST) and compared the results in a group of previously treated and newly detected TB patients in an urban area in southeastern China. One thousand one hundred seventy-three (83.8%) new cases and 227 (16.2%) previously treated cases were collected between January 2011 and September 2013. The GeneChip showed a specificity of 97.8% and a sensitivity of 94.8% for detection of RMP resistance and 97.3% and 70.9%, respectively, for INH resistance in new cases. For previously treated cases, the overall sensitivity, specificity, and agreement rate are 94.6%, 91.3%, and 92.1%, respectively, for detection of RMP resistance and 69.7%, 95.4%, and 86.8%, respectively, for INH resistance. The sensitivity and specificity of MDR-TB were 81.8% and 99.0% in new cases and 77.8% and 93.4% in previously treated cases, respectively. The GeneChip system provides a simple, rapid, reliable, and accurate clinical assay for the detection of TB drug resistance, and it is a potentially important diagnostic tool in a high-prevalence area.

10.1128_JCM.01946_14	Evaluating the Auto-MODS Assay, a Novel Tool for Tuberculosis Diagnosis for Use in Resource-Limited Settings	There is an urgent need for simple, rapid, and affordable diagnostic tests for tuberculosis (TB) to combat the great burden of the disease in developing countries. The microscopic observation drug susceptibility assay (MODS) is a promising tool to fill this need, but it is not widely used due to concerns regarding its biosafety and efficiency. This study evaluated the automated MODS (Auto-MODS), which operates on principles similar to those of MODS but with several key modifications, making it an appealing alternative to MODS in resource-limited settings. In the operational setting of Chiang Rai, Thailand, we compared the performance of Auto-MODS with the gold standard liquid culture method in Thailand, mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT) 960 plus the SD Bioline TB Ag MPT64 test, in terms of accuracy and efficiency in differentiating TB and non-TB samples as well as distinguishing TB and multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB samples. Sputum samples from clinically diagnosed TB and non-TB subjects across 17 hospitals in Chiang Rai were consecutively collected from May 2011 to September 2012. A total of 360 samples were available for evaluation, of which 221 (61.4%) were positive and 139 (38.6%) were negative for mycobacterial cultures according to MGIT 960. Of the 221 true-positive samples, Auto-MODS identified 212 as positive and 9 as negative (sensitivity, 95.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 92.4% to 98.1%). Of the 139 true-negative samples, Auto-MODS identified 135 as negative and 4 as positive (specificity, 97.1%; 95% CI, 92.8% to 99.2%). The median time to culture positivity was 10 days, with an interquartile range of 8 to 13 days for Auto-MODS. Auto-MODS is an effective and cost-sensitive alternative diagnostic tool for TB diagnosis in resource-limited settings.		MICROSCOPIC-OBSERVATION; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS
pub-0707	Risk factors of mortality in patients with multi-drug resistant TB	Background: Multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) occurs when the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, becomes resistant to isonazid and rifampin, the two most effective drugs commonly used to treat TB. Despite high rates of MDR-TB in Ethiopia, little data exist on the prevalence of or risk factors for drug-resistant tuberculosis. Objective: The aim of the current study was to identify risk factors that are associated with MDR-TB in patients from the All Africa Leprosy, Tuberculosis and Rehabilitation Training Center (ALERT), Addis Ababa, and Gondar University Teaching and Referral Hospital, Gondar, Ethiopia. Methods: The study included 342 MDR-TB patients (142 from ALERT and 200 from Gondar) who had been under treatment from August 2011 to August 2014 and for whom data for the variables of interest were complete. Descriptive statistics, univariate and multivariate survival analyses were applied. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival longevity as well as survival levels by covariates. The proportional hazards regression model was employed to identify covariates that have effect on the survival of MDR-TB patients. Results: Out of the total 342 subjects, 37(10.8%) died before the end of the follow-up period (August 2011 to September 2014); 11 and 12 deaths occurred in the first and second three-months of MDR-TB treatment followup, respectively. The median survival for MDR-TB patients was 16 months. Covariates associated with increased risk of mortality were: having clinical complications, resistance to Isoniazid (INH), Rifampicin (RIF) and at least one of other drugs (Ethambutol (E), Streptomysin (STM), Kanamycin (KAN), Amikacin (AMK) & Capreomycin (CPM)), smoking, body weight and age. Conclusion: The mortality rate of patients was high at the earlier stages of treatment. The three laboratory and clinical factors (complication, resistance to drugs, smoking) were found to have significant association with increased risk of mortality.		
10.1183_09031936.00101814	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis around the world: what progress has been made?	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) (resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin) will influence the future of global TB control. 88% of estimated MDR-TB cases occur in middle- or high-income countries, and 60% occur in Brazil, China, India, the Russian Federation and South Africa. The World Health Organization collects country data annually to monitor the response to MDR-TB. Notification, treatment enrolment and outcome data were summarised for 30 countries, accounting for >90% of the estimated MDR-TB cases among notified TB cases worldwide. In 2012, a median of 14% (interquartile range 6-50%) of estimated MDR-TB cases were notified in the 30 countries studied. In 15 of the 30 countries, the number of patients treated for MDR-TB in 2012 (71 681) was >50% higher than in 2011. Median treatment success was 53% (interquartile range 40-70%) in the 25 countries reporting data for 30 021 MDR-TB cases who started treatment in 2010. Although progress has been noted in the expansion of MDR-TB care, urgent efforts are required in order to provide wider access to diagnosis and treatment in most countries with the highest burden of MDR-TB.

10.1183_09031936.00035114	Efficacy, safety and tolerability of linezolid for the treatment of XDR-TB: a study in China	Linezolid may be effective in treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. We conducted a prospective, multicentre, randomised study to further evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of linezolid in patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in China. 65 patients who had culture-positive sputum for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis were randomly assigned to a linezolid therapy group or a control group. Patients in the two groups adopted a 2-year individually based chemotherapy regimen. The linezolid therapy group was given linezolid at a start dose of 1200 mg per day for a period of 4-6 weeks and this was then followed by a dose of 300-600 mg per day. The proportion of sputum culture conversions in the linezolid therapy group was 78.8% by 24 months, significantly higher than that in the control group (37.6%, p<0.001). The treatment success rate in linezolid therapy group was 69.7%, significantly higher than that in the control group (34.4%, p=0.004). 27 (81.8%) patients had clinically significant adverse events in the linezolid group, of whom 25 (93%) patients had events that were possibly or probably related to linezolid. Most adverse events resolved after reducing the dosage of linezolid or temporarily discontinuing linezolid. Linezolid containing chemotherapy for treatment of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis may significantly promote cavity closure, increase sputum culture-conversion rate and improve treatment success rate.

10.1186_s12879_014_0703_0	The Mycobacterium tuberculosis Uganda II family and resistance to first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs in Uganda	Background: The global increase in the burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) underscores an urgent need for data on factors involved in generation and spread of TB drug resistance. We performed molecular analyses on a representative sample of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates. Basing on findings of the molecular epidemiological study in Kampala, we hypothesized that the predominant MTB strain lineage in Uganda is negatively associated with anti-TB drug resistance and we set out to test this hypothesis. Methods: We extracted DNA from mycobacterial isolates collected from smear-positive TB patients in the national TB drug resistance survey and carried out IS6110-PCR. To identify MTB lineages/sub lineages RT-PCR SNP was performed using specific primers and hybridization probes and the 'melting curve' analysis was done to distinguish the Uganda II family from other MTB families. The primary outcome was the distribution of the Uganda II family and its associations with anti-TB drug resistance and HIV infection. Results: Out of the 1537 patients enrolled, MTB isolates for 1001 patients were available for SNP analysis for identification of Uganda II family, of which 973 (97%) had conclusive RT-PCR results. Of these 422 (43.4%) were of the Uganda II family, mostly distributed in the south west zone (55.0%; OR = 4.6 for comparison with other zones; 95% CI 2.83-7.57; p < 0.001) but occurred in each of the other seven geographic zones at varying levels. Compared to the Uganda II family, other genotypes as a group were more likely to be resistant to any anti-TB drug (ORadj = 2.9; 95% CI 1.63-5.06; p = 0.001) or MDR (ORadj 4.9; 95% CI, 1.15-20.60; p = 0.032), even after adjusting for geographic zone, patient category, sex, residence and HIV status. It was commonest in the 25-34 year age group 159/330 (48.2%). No association was observed between Uganda II family and HIV infection. Conclusion: The Uganda II family is a major cause of morbidity due to TB in all NTLP zones in Uganda. It is less likely to be resistant to anti-TB drugs than other MTB strain lineages.		
10.1371_journal.pone.0112789	Characterization of the Genetic Diversity of Extensively-Drug Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Clinical Isolates from Pulmonary Tuberculosis Patients in Peru	Background: Peru holds the fourth highest burden of tuberculosis in the Americas. Despite an apparently well-functioning DOTS control program, the prevalence of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) continues to increase. To worsen this situation, cases of extensively drug resistance tuberculosis (XDR-TB) have been detected. Little information exists about the genetic diversity of drug-susceptible vs. MDR-TB and XDR-TB. Methods: Cryopreserved samples of XDR strains from 2007 to 2009 (second semester), were identified and collected. Starting from 227 frozen samples, a total of 142 XDR-TB strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC; 1 isolate per patient) were retained for this study. Each strain DNA was analyzed by spoligotyping and the 15-loci Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Unit (MIRU-15). Results: Among the 142 isolates analyzed, only 2 samples (1.41%) could not be matched to any lineage. The most prevalent sublineage was Haarlem (43.66%), followed by T (27.46%), LAM (16.2%), Beijing (9.15%), and X clade (1.41%). Spoligotype analysis identified clustering for 128/142 (90.1%) isolates vs. 49/142 (34.5%) with MIRUs. Of the samples, 90.85% belonged to retreated patients. The drug resistant profile demonstrated that 62.67% showed resistance to injectable drugs capreomycin (CAP) and kanamycin (KAN) vs. 15.5% to CAP alone and 21.8% to KAN alone. The SIT219/T1 and SIT50/H3 were the most prevalent patterns in our study. The spoligoforest analysis showed that SIT53/T1 was at the origin of many of the T lineage strains as well as a big proportion of Haarlem lineage strains (SIT50/H3, followed by SIT47/H1, SIT49/H3, and SIT2375/H1), as opposed to the SIT1/Beijing strains that did not appear to evolve into minor Beijing sublineages among the XDR-TB strains. Conclusion: In contrast with other Latin-American countries where LAM sublineage is the most predominant, we found the Haarlem to be the most common followed by T sublineage among the XDR-TB strains.

10.1186_s12866_014_0307_2	Diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and drug resistance in different provinces of Papua New Guinea	Background: Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a high tuberculosis (TB) burden country of the WHO Western Pacific Region, but so far research on drug resistance (DR) and genotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) was only conducted in few provinces in the country. The aim of the present study was to obtain baseline data on the level of drug resistance and the genotypic diversity of circulating M. tuberculosis in additional provinces and to investigate the differences between three selected sites across PNG. Results: Genotyping of 147 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates collected in Goroka, Eastern Highlands Province, in Alotau, Milne Bay Province and in Madang, Madang Province revealed three main lineages of M. tuberculosis: Lineage 4 (European-American lineage), Lineage 2 (East-Asian lineage) and Lineage 1 (Indo-Oceanic lineage). All three lineages were detected in all three sites, but the individual lineage compositions varied significantly between sites. In Madang Lineage 4 was the most prevalent lineage (76.6%), whereas in Goroka and Alotau Lineage 2 was dominating (60.5% and 84.4%, respectively) (p < 0.001). Overall, phenotypic drug susceptibility testing showed 10.8% resistance to at least one of the first-line drugs tested. Of all resistant strains (23/212) 30.4% were Streptomycin mono-resistant, 17.4% were Isoniazid mono-resistant and 13% were Rifampicin mono-resistant. Multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB was found in 2.8% of all tested cases (6/212). The highest amount of MDR TB was found in Alotau in Milne Bay Province (4.6%). Conclusion: A large number of drug resistant TB infections are present in the country and MDR TB has already been detected in all three surveyed regions of PNG, highlighting the importance of monitoring drug resistance and making it a high priority for the National Control Program. Due to the high prevalence of Lineage 2 in Milne Bay Province and given the frequent association of this lineage with drug resistance, monitoring of the latter should especially be scaled up in that province.

10.4414_smw.2014.14053	Treatment outcomes of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Switzerland	OBJECTIVE: To assess outcomes 24 months after treatment start for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). METHODS: Cohort study of all culture-positive MDR-TB cases notified in Switzerland from 01/2003 to 07/2010. RESULTS: Fifty-one cases were observed, with a median age of 26 years (range 2-56). Twenty-seven were male, five of Swiss origin, 46 of foreign origin (Asia 18, Africa 13, former Soviet Union 8), including 21 asylum seekers and refugees. Twelve had received a previous treatment for TB and 24 had not (15 unknown). Forty-four cases were pulmonary of which 25 were known to be sputum smear positive. All but two strains showed additional resistances: 29 to ethambutol, 27 to pyrazinamide, 6 to a fluoroquinolone, 5 to amikacin. None was resistant to both of the latter two classes. Molecular analyses showed three pairs of identical strains. Fluoroquinolones were used in 48 patients and second-line injectable drugs in 37. The median duration of MDR treatment was 18 months (range 1-26). The outcome after 24 months was successful in 39 (76%) and unsatisfactory in 12 (24%) patients: two deaths from TB; two treatments terminated owing to side effects of drugs and one owing to pregnancy; four defaults from treatment at months 0, 4, 8, and 21; two transfers abroad with unknown outcome; one outcome unknown. There was no significant association of unfavourable outcomes with age, sex, origin, previous treatment, treatment delay, resistance pattern, and classes of drugs used. CONCLUSIONS: MDR-TB in Switzerland occurs mostly in persons of foreign origin. Results of decentralised treatments were satisfactory.	tuberculosis; multidrug resistance; MDR; antituberculosis drug resistance; treatment outcomes; treatment results; epidemiology; Switzerland	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; METAANALYSIS; DELAMANID; RISK
10.1016_j.ijid.2014.05.020	Genetic diversity of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in a resource-limited region of China	Objectives: To gain an insight into the genetic diversity of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in Chongqing Municipality, an MDR tuberculosis (MDR-TB) epidemic region of China. Methods: In this study, a total of 208 M. tuberculosis isolates from smear-positive TB patients in Chongqing were genotyped by spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat typing (MIRU-VNTR). In addition, statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the distributions of drug susceptibility patterns and demographic data among different genotypes. Results: Our results showed that 156 MDR M. tuberculosis strains (75.0%) belonged to the Beijing genotype, while the other 52 strains (25.0%) were non-Beijing genotype. The proportion of Beijing genotype in the re-treated patient group was significantly higher than that in the new patient group (p = 0.013), while drug resistance and demographic characteristics showed no statistically significant associations with Beijing genotype (p > 0.05). In addition, the 208 strains were clustered into 193 genotypes using a 10-locus VNTR set; the cumulative clustering rate was 12.98% and the HGDI was 0.9991. Conclusions: Beijing genotype was the predominant genotype among the isolates from MDR-TB cases in Chongqing. The re-treated MDR-TB cases were more likely to be attributed to Beijing genotype infection. The 10-locus VNTR set demonstrated a good discrimination power for genotyping MDR M. tuberculosis isolates circulating in Chongqing Municipality. (C) 2014 The Authors.

10.1111_biom.12198	A Bayesian Nonparametric Model for Spatially Distributed Multivariate Binary Data with Application to a Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Study	There has been an increasing interest in the analysis of spatially distributed multivariate binary data motivated by a wide range of research problems. Two types of correlations are usually involved: the correlation between the multiple outcomes at one location and the spatial correlation between the locations for one particular outcome. The commonly used regression models only consider one type of correlations while ignoring or modeling inappropriately the other one. To address this limitation, we adopt a Bayesian nonparametric approach to jointly modeling multivariate spatial binary data by integrating both types of correlations. A multivariate probit model is employed to link the binary outcomes to Gaussian latent variables; and Gaussian processes are applied to specify the spatially correlated random effects. We develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the posterior computation. We illustrate the proposed model on simulation studies and a multidrug-resistant tuberculosis case study.

pub-0716	PCR-SSCCP analysis in detecting point mutations targeting rpoB, katG and inhA genes for determining multi-drug resistance in Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains	The usefulness of polymerase chain reaction-single stranded confirmation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) for determination of rifampicin and isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. bovis cultures from human and animal origin was investigated. Mycobacteria (81) in the study included, viz. 12 MDR-TB samples, 35 sputum samples, 3 lung and lymphnode tissues from bovines and 11 M. tuberculosis and 18 M. bovis culture, M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. bovis BCG strain). All the mycobacterial cultures were characterized on growth characteristics, biochemical test pattern, MTB complex specific IS6110 PCR and species specific 12.7 kb multiplex PCR. PCR-SSCP was used to determine resistance against rifiampin by targeting rpoB gene (305 bp) and isoniazid by targeting katG (237 bp) and inhA (261 bp). Rifampicin resistance was detected by PCR-SSCP in 1 out of 12 MDR-TB samples (8.3%), while isoniazid resistance was detected in 66.7% of MDR-TB samples using PCR-SSCP of katG and 75% of MDR-TB samples using inhA SSCP analysis.

10.1016_j.tube.2014.08.001	Cationic amphipathic D-enantiomeric antimicrobial peptides with in vitro and ex vivo activity against drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of bacterial death worldwide. Due to the emergence of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), and the persistence of latent infections, a safe and effective TB therapy is highly sought after. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have therapeutic potential against infectious diseases and have the ability to target microbial pathogens within eukaryotic cells. In the present study, we investigated the activity of a family of six AMPs containing all-D amino acids (D-LAK peptides) against MDR and XDR clinical strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) both in vitro and, using THP-1 cells as a macrophage model, cultured ex vivo. All the DLAK peptides successfully inhibited the growth of Mtb in vitro and were similarly effective against MDR and XDR strains. D-LAK peptides effectively broke down the heavy clumping of mycobacteria in broth culture, consistent with a 'detergent-like effect' that could reduce the hydrophobic interactions between the highly lipidic cell walls of the mycobacteria, preventing bacteria cell aggregation. Furthermore, though not able to eradicate the intracellular mycobacteria, D-LAK peptides substantially inhibited the intracellular growth of drug-resistant Mtb clinical isolates at concentrations that were well tolerated by THP-1 cells. Finally, combining D-LAK peptide with isoniazid could enhance the anti-TB efficacy. D-LAK peptide, particularly D-LAK120-A, was effective as an adjunct agent at non-toxic concentration to potentiate the efficacy of isoniazid against drug-resistant Mtb in vitro, possibly by facilitating the access of isoniazid into the mycobacteria by increasing the surface permeability of the pathogen.

10.1093_cid_ciu631	Significant Clinical Impact of a Rapid Molecular Diagnostic Test (Genotype MTBDRplus Assay) to Detect Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	"Background. There are limited data on the clinical impact of rapid diagnostic tests to detect multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). We sought to determine whether the use of a molecular diagnostic test to detect MDR-TB improves clinical outcomes. Methods. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to analyze the impact of the Genotype MTBDRplus assay on clinical outcomes among patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary MDR-TB. Patients received treatment at the National Center for Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases in Tbilisi, Georgia. Time to MDR-TB treatment initiation, culture conversion, and infection control measures were compared to a time period prior to the implementation of the molecular test. Results. Of 152 MDR-TB patients, 72 (47%) were from prior to and 80 (53%) following implementation of the MTBDRplus assay (""post-implementation group""). Patients in the post-implementation group initiated a second-line treatment regimen more rapidly than those in the pre-implementation group (18.2 vs 83.9 days, P < .01). Among patients admitted to a ""drug-susceptible"" tuberculosis ward, those from the post-implementation group spent significantly fewer days on the drug-susceptible ward compared to patients in the pre-implementation group (10.0 vs 58.3 days, P < .01). Among patients with 24 weeks follow-up (n = 119), those in the post-implementation group had a higher rate of culture conversion at 24 weeks (86% vs 63%, P < .01) and a more rapid rate of time to culture conversion (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 4.15, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5-6.9). Conclusions. The implementation of a rapid molecular diagnostic test led to significant clinical improvements including reduced time to initiation of MDR-TB treatment, culture conversion, and improved infection control practices."	tuberculosis; drug-resistance; MTBDRplus; clinical outcomes	INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; SOUTH-AFRICA; TRANSMISSION; METAANALYSIS; TIME
10.1016_j.ijantimicag.2014.06.021	Mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit typing and mutational profile for multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis surveillance in Portugal: a 3-year period overview	, Multidrug tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) cases constitute a serious health problem in Portugal, of which the majority of isolates belong to the Lisboa family and the Q1 cluster, highly related to the Lisboa family. Here we sought to investigate the molecular basis of resistant TB as well as to determine the prevalence of specific drug resistance mutations and their association with MDR-TB and/or XDR-TB. In total, 74 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates collected in Lisbon Health Region were genotyped by 24-loci mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR), and the mutational profile associated with first- and second-line drug resistance was studied. Seven new mutations were found, whilst the remaining 28 mutations had been previously associated with drug resistance. None of the mutations was specifically associated with MDR-TB. The mutational patterns observed among isolates belonging to Lisboa3 and Q1 clusters were also observed in isolates with unique MIRU-VNTR patterns but closely related to these strains. Such data suggest that the genotyping technique employed discriminates isolates with the same mutational profile. To establish the most adequate genotyping technique, the discriminatory power of three different MIRU-VNTR sets was analysed. The 15-loci MIRU-VNTR set showed adequate discriminatory power, comparable with the 24-loci set, allowing clustering of 60% and 86% of the MDR-TB and XDR-TB isolates, respectively, the majority of which belonged to the Lisboa3 and Q1 clusters. From an epidemiological standpoint, this study suggests combined mutational and genotyping analysis as a valuable tool for drug resistance surveillance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.

10.1089_mdr.2013.0171	Ofloxacin Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Is Associated with Efflux Pump Activity Independent of Resistance Pattern and Genotype	Drug-resistance to ofloxacin (OFX) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is due to missense mutations in gyrA and other factors, such as alterations in the activity of drug efflux pumps. In this study, we identified 8 extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), 40 multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB), 38 polydrug resistant TB (PDR-TB), and 16 single OFX-resistant TB from 102 clinical isolates. We tested the effect of three efflux inhibitors, reserpine, verapamil, and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), on changes in the OFX minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using Resazurin microtitre assay. These three inhibitors changed the MICs from 2- to 32-fold, with CCCP having the strongest effect. A total of 55%, 74%, and 83% of the tested isolates had changes in MIC of more than two-fold by reserpine, verapamil, and CCCP, respectively. The inhibitors led to similar fold-changes of OFX MICs in the XDR, MDR, PDR, and single OFX-resistant isolates. For each inhibitor, a higher resistance to OFX was associated with the greater efflux pump activity. There were no significant differences in the effect of efflux pump inhibitors upon Beijing and non-Beijing M. tuberculosis genotypes. Taken together, these results indicate that the efflux pump activity was greater in the isolates higher resistant to OFX and had similar effects on isolates with different drug resistant pattern, and had similar effects on Beijing and non-Beijing genotypes.

10.5588_ijtld.14.0277	'I'm fed up': experiences of prior anti-tuberculosis treatment in patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis and HIV	OBJECTIVES: To understand the impact of past experiences of anti-tuberculosis treatment among patients co-infected with the human immunodeficiency virus and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) on perceptions and attitudes towards treatment. METHODS: Qualitative study using in-depth interviews with 12 HIV-MDR-TB co-infected patients in Mumbai, India. RESUTS: Patients reported unnecessarily long pathways to care and fatigue with diagnostic and treatment procedures. In particular, they expressed concerns over the lack of efficacy of their current treatment regimen based on their experiences with anti-tuberculosis treatment regimens in the past. CONCLUSION: Patients reported negative experiences with previous HIV and anti-tuberculosis treatment. Access to early diagnosis and rapid initiation of integrated care for HIV-MDR-TB co-infected patients, with a strong, patient-centered support system, could help to combat the low morale and lack of faith in treatment described in this group of patients.	human immunodeficiency virus; TB-HIV; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; treatment adherence; qualitative study; India; operational research	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; STANDARDIZED REGIMENS; SOUTH-AFRICA; METAANALYSIS; PREVALENCE; MANAGEMENT; THERAPY; DEFAULT
10.1371_journal.pone.0111702	Development and Evaluation of a Pilot Nurse Case Management Model to Address Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and HIV in South Africa	Setting: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) unit in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Objective: To develop and evaluate a nurse case management model and intervention using the tenets of the Chronic Care Model to manage treatment for MDR-TB patients with a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection. Design: A quasi-experimental pilot programme utilizing a nurse case manager to manage care for 40 hospitalized MDR-TB patients, 70% HIV co-infected, during the intensive phase of MDR-TB treatment. Patients were followed for six months to compare proximal outcomes identified in the model between the pre- and post-intervention period. Results: The greatest percent differences between baseline and six-month MDR-TB proximal outcomes were seen in the following three areas: baseline symptom evaluation on treatment initiation (95% improvement), baseline and monthly laboratory evaluations completed per guidelines (75% improvement), and adverse drug reactions acted upon by medical and/or nursing intervention (75% improvement). Conclusion: Improvements were identified in guideline-based treatment and monitoring of adverse drug reactions following implementation of the nurse case management intervention. Further study is required to determine if the intervention introduced in this model will ultimately result in improvements in final MDR-TB treatment outcomes.

10.1186_1471_2164_15_991	Unraveling Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomic diversity and evolution in Lisbon, Portugal, a highly drug resistant setting	Background: Multidrug- (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) presents a challenge to disease control and elimination goals. In Lisbon, Portugal, specific and successful XDR-TB strains have been found in circulation for almost two decades. Results: In the present study we have genotyped and sequenced the genomes of 56 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates recovered mostly from Lisbon. The genotyping data revealed three major clusters associated with MDR-TB, two of which are associated with XDR-TB. Whilst the genomic data contributed to elucidate the phylogenetic positioning of circulating MDR-TB strains, showing a high predominance of a single SNP cluster group 5. Furthermore, a genome-wide phylogeny analysis from these strains, together with 19 publicly available genomes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates, revealed two major clades responsible for M/XDR-TB in the region: Lisboa3 and Q1 (LAM). The data presented by this study yielded insights on microevolution and identification of novel compensatory mutations associated with rifampicin resistance in rpoB and rpoC. The screening for other structural variations revealed putative clade-defining variants. One deletion in PPE41, found among Lisboa3 isolates, is proposed to contribute to immune evasion and as a selective advantage. Insertion sequence (IS) mapping has also demonstrated the role of IS6110 as a major driver in mycobacterial evolution by affecting gene integrity and regulation. Conclusions: Globally, this study contributes with novel genome-wide phylogenetic data and has led to the identification of new genomic variants that support the notion of a growing genomic diversity facing both setting and host adaptation.

10.3760_cma.j.issn.0366_6999.20141004	Evaluation of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for diagnosis of tuberculosis and rifampin resistance in county-level laboratories in Hunan province, China	Background The Xpert MTB/RIF showed high sensitivity and specificity in previous studies carried out in different epidemiological and geographical settings and patient populations in high-burden tuberculosis (TB) countries. However, there were little data obtained by validation or demonstration study of the assay in China. In this study, the performance of Xpert MTB/RIF was investigated in two county-level laboratories in Hunan Province, China. Methods Consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and suspicion for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were enrolled. For each patient suspected to have PTB, three sputum specimens (one spot sputum, one night sputum, and one morning sputum) were collected and each sputum was tested with smear microscopy, Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ culture, and Xpert MTB/RIF test. For comparison across subgroups and testing methods, 95% confidence intervals were calculated. All analyses were done with SPSS 16.0, and P <0.05 was regarded as significant. Results For case detection, the sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF was 100% for smear- and culture-positive TB and 88.6% for smear-negative and culture-positive TB; the overall sensitivity was 94.5% for all culture-positive patients. The specificity was 99.8%. The sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF assay was 22.0% in clinical TB patients and the specificity reached 100.0% in the group of patients who are infected with nontuberculous mycobacteria. For the detection of rifampin resistance, the sensitivity of MTB/RIF RIF-resistance detection was 92.9%, and the specificity was 98.7%. Of the 26 Xpert MTB/RIF-positive and RIF-resistant patients confirmed by LJ proportion tests, 20 (76.9%) patients were infected by MDR-TB. Conclusions The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a highly sensitive and specific method for diagnosis of TB and RIF resistance, which will enable it to have the potential to be used in county-level laboratories and lead to the reduction of the infectious pool and improvements in TB control in China. Further evaluations in county-level laboratories for implementing the assay are still required.	pulmonary tuberculosis; Xpert MTB/RIF; diagnosis; rifampin resistance	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; RAPID DETECTION; SUSCEPTIBILITY; IMPLEMENTATION; TIME
10.1016_j.rmed.2014.09.021	Cost of multi drug resistance tuberculosis in Germany	Objectives: 4220 new cases of tuberculosis (TB) were reported in Germany in 2012; of those, 65 cases were multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) or extensively multidrug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) cases. However, there is only limited information on the economic consequences of drug resistance patterns on the treatment costs of MDR-and XDR-TB patients. Methods: On the basis of drug susceptibility of the single MDR-TB/XDR-TB strains the direct medical costs of suitable therapies were calculated according to the current guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) and those of the German Central Committee against Tuberculosis. These costs were combined with hospital and outpatients monitoring costs and followed the most recent German invoicing system and health statistics. Total drug and monitoring costs and were determined by Monte-Carlo simulation comprising all different options. Results: According to this, the mean drug costs were (sic)51,113.22 (range (sic)19,586.14 to (sic)94,767.90). The weighted costs for hospitalization were (sic)26,000.76 per patient compared to only (sic)2,192.13 for primary outpatients; the total treatment costs of MDR-TB amounted to (sic)64,429.23. These are joined by the costs due to loss of productivity, varying between (sic)17,721.60 and (sic)44,304. From a societal perspective, the total cost per MDR-TB/XDR-TB case reach an amount between (sic)82,150 and (sic)108,733 per case, respectively. Conclusion: Cost analyses based on strain resistance patterns allow more reliable estimates of the real costs of treating MDR-TB/XDR-TB than do methods that ignore this factor. Advantageously, they demonstrate the economic impact of drug-resistant TB in low-incidence countries. Costs of productivity loss is of new importance because of the length of MDR-XDR therapy, but its true share of total costs has still to be determined. (C) 2014 The Authors.

10.1002_phar.1482	Bedaquiline: A Novel Antitubercular Agent for the Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Bedaquiline is a diarylquinoline antitubercular drug with a novel mechanism of action against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Bedaquiline works by inhibiting bacterial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase and represents the first novel class of antituberculosis agents in more than 40 years. Bedaquiline is indicated for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) in combination with at least three other antitubercular drugs when no other effective regimen is available. The recommended bedaquiline dosage is 400 mg orally once/day for 2 weeks followed by 200 mg orally 3 times/week for 22 weeks. Bedaquiline should be administered with food, which increases the bioavailability 2-fold. Bedaquiline is metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 and is impacted by both inducers and inhibitors of this isoenzyme. Concentration-dependent bactericidal activity was observed in laboratory and murine studies. Accelerated approval was granted in the United States and European Union based on the results of two phase IIb clinical studies that used sputum culture clearance as a surrogate end point for clinical efficacy. These studies showed greater sputum culture clearance up to week 24 for the bedaquiline group compared with placebo. Common adverse events in clinical trials included nausea, arthralgia, and headache. Serious adverse events included elevated serum transaminase levels and rate-corrected QT-interval prolongation. Unexplained higher mortality was seen in patients receiving bedaquiline versus those receiving placebo. Bedaquiline is a novel agent with a unique mechanism of action and has the potential to meet a great need in patients with MDR TB who have no other treatment options. Due to safety concerns and limited clinical information, phase III trials are needed to fully determine its place in therapy.	bedaquiline; TMC207; R207910; diarylquinoline; ATP synthase; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; MDR TB; tuberculosis	EARLY BACTERICIDAL ACTIVITY; ATP SYNTHASE INHIBITOR; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; DIARYLQUINOLINE TMC207; PHARMACOKINETICS; MODEL; TOLERABILITY; EFAVIRENZ; R207910
10.1128_AAC.03246_14	Impact of Lopinavir-Ritonavir or Nevirapine on Bedaquiline Exposures and Potential Implications for Patients with Tuberculosis-HIV Coinfection	Concomitant treatment of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV is recommended and improves outcomes. Bedaquiline is a novel drug for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB; combined use with antiretroviral drugs, nevirapine, or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) is anticipated, but no clinical data from coinfected patients are available. Plasma concentrations of bedaquiline and its M2 metabolite after single doses were obtained from interaction studies with nevirapine or LPV/r in healthy volunteers. The antiretrovirals' effects on bedaquiline and M2 pharmacokinetics were assessed by nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Potential dose adjustments were evaluated with simulations. No significant effects of nevirapine on bedaquiline pharmacokinetics were identified. LPV/r decreased bedaquiline and M2 clearances to 35% (relative standard error [RSE], 9.2%) and 58% (RSE, 8.4%), respectively, of those without comedication. As almost 3-fold (bedaquiline) and 2-fold (M2) increases in exposures during chronic treatment with LPV/r are expected, dose adjustments are suggested for evaluation. Efficacious, safe bedaquiline dosing for MDR-TB patients receiving antiretrovirals is important. Modeling results suggest that bedaquiline can be coadministered with nevirapine without dose adjustments. The predicted elevation of bedaquiline and M2 levels during LPV/r coadministration may be a safety concern, and careful monitoring is recommended. Further data are being collected in coinfected patients to determine whether dose adjustments are needed.

10.1007_s10096_014_2144_5	Molecular and phenotypic characterization of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates resistant to kanamycin, amikacin, and capreomycin in China	Although second-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) injectable drugs have been widely used to improve treatment outcomes of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), little is known about the prevalence and mechanism of second-line injectable drug resistance among MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in China. Here, we found that 12.7 % (20/158) of isolates showed resistance to at least one second-line injectable drug among 158 MDR isolates. At the same time, there were 16 (10.1 %) strains resistant to kanamycin (KAN), 9 (5.7 %) to amikacin (AMK), and 12 (7.6 %) to capreomycin (CAP). In addition, our data revealed no significant difference in the drug resistance patterns for Beijing versus non-Beijing genotype strains (p > 0.05). The most frequently observed mutation was A-to-G substitution at position 1401 of the rrs gene, conferring high-level resistance to KAN and AMK, but had varying minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for CAP. The mutations in the eis promoter and tlyA gene were responsible for low-level resistance to CAP. 83.3 % of A1401G substitutions in the rrs gene was observed in Beijing genotype strains, while the difference was not significant (p = 0.157). Our data demonstrated that the hot-spot regions localized in the rrs gene serve as excellent markers for AMK, but is not a sensitive marker for KAN and CAP. In addition, the cross-resistance patterns and MICs differed among different genetic mutation types, which challenge the practice in China of generalizing resistance to AMK and CAP based on the resistance to KAN alone. Our findings suggested that the individualized drug susceptibility to three major second-line injectable drugs is essential in order to generate more effective treatment regimens for MDR patients.

10.1097_QAI.0000000000000309	Diagnostic Delays and Clinical Decision Making With Centralized Xpert MTB/RIF Testing in Durban, South Africa	Setting:We conducted a retrospective study among HIV-infected adult suspects (18 years) with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), who underwent Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) testing at McCord Hospital and its adjoining HIV clinic in Durban, South Africa.Objective:To determine if Xpert testing performed at a centralized laboratory accelerated time to TB diagnosis.Design:We obtained data on sputum smear microscopy [acid-fast bacilli (AFB)], Xpert, and the rationale for treatment initiation from medical records. The primary outcome was total diagnostic time, defined as time from sputum collection to clinicians' receipt of results. A linear mixed-effect model compared the duration of steps in the diagnostic pathway across testing modalities.Results:Among 403 participants, the median total diagnostic time for AFB and Xpert was 3.3 and 6.4 days, respectively (P < 0.001). When compared with AFB, the median delay for Xpert laboratory processing was 1.4 days (P < 0.001) and result transfer to clinic was 1.7 days (P < 0.001). Among 86 Xpert-positive participants who initiated treatment, 49 (57%) started treatment based on clinical suspicion or AFB-positive results, whereas only 32 (37%) started treatment based on Xpert-positive results.Conclusions:In our setting, Xpert results took twice as long as AFB results to reach clinicians. Replacing AFB with centralized Xpert may delay TB diagnoses in some settings.	tuberculosis; HIV; AIDS; Xpert MTB; RIF assay; diagnostic testing; South Africa	UNDERMINES POTENTIAL IMPACT; LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES; OF-CARE DIAGNOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; RIFAMPIN RESISTANCE; MDR-TB; IMPLEMENTATION; SETTINGS; ACCURACY
10.1007_s10238_013_0258_1	Alterations in the peripheral blood B cell subpopulations of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients	The function of B cells in the immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is still regarded as secondary, although major findings in mouse models of tuberculosis (TB) support their participation as regulators and antibody producers. However, studies in cohorts of TB or multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients have failed to clearly identify changes in the circulating B cell pool. Therefore, in the present study we aimed at identifying alterations in the different B cell subpopulations in peripheral blood samples of HIV-negative pulmonary MDR-TB patients when compared to healthy donors. The data show, for the first time, that MDR-TB patients, similarly to what has been observed in other chronic inflammatory diseases, have a much lower frequency of peripheral blood unswitched IgD(+) CD27(+) memory B cells. Equally novel are the findings that in MDR-TB patients there is a reduction in the circulating plasma cell pool and that in MDR-TB there is an increased frequency of circulating type 1 transitional IgD(+) CD38(++), CD69(+) and TLR9(+) B cells. These results document disease-related shifts in peripheral blood B cell subsets in MDR-TB and suggest that such changes should be taken into account when designing new strategies to boost the cellular and humoral immune response against Mtb.

10.5588_ijtld.14.0116	Identifying multidrug resistance in previously treated tuberculosis patients: a mixed-methods study in Cambodia	SETTING: Previously treated tuberculosis (TB) patients are a priority for drug susceptibility testing (DST) to identify cases with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). A Cambodia study found that one third of smear-positive previously treated patients had DST results. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the gaps in the detection of MDR-TB in previously treated TB patients in Cambodia, and describe health workers' perspectives on barriers, facilitators and potential interventions. DESIGN: Analysis of Cambodia's 2004-2012 case notifications and semi-structured interviews with stake-holders. RESULTS: The proportion of previously treated notifications varied significantly across provinces in 2010 2012. If there had been no attrition along the path to detecting MDR-TB among smear-positive notified cases in 2012, an estimated 75 additional MDR-TB cases could have been identified, which would double the number actually detected. Most were lost due to misclassification of previously treated patients as 'new'. Barriers include patients' reluctance to disclose and staff difficulty in eliciting treatment history, partly attributed to the availability of streptomycin (SM) only in hospitals. Facilitators include collection of sputum for DST even if previously treated patients are not receiving SM, streamlining sputum transportation and prompt reporting of results. CONCLUSION: Improved monitoring, supportive staff supervision and training, patient education, and correct classification of previously treated cases are essential for improving the detection of MDR-TB.

10.5588_ijtld.14.0011	Geographic predictors of primary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cases in an endemic area of Lima, Peru	SETTING: Peru reports among the highest multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) rates in the Americas, with a growing proportion in previously untreated tuberculosis (TB) cases. The identification of clusters of primary MDR-TB compared with drug-susceptible TB (DS-TB) could help prioritize interventions. OBJECTIVE: To examine the clustering of primary MDR-TB case residences and their proximity to highrisk locations in San Juan de Lurigancho District, Lima, Peru. DESIGN: Enrolled primary MDR-TB and primary DS-TB cases were interviewed and their primary residence was recorded using handheld Global Positioning System devices. Kuldorff's spatial scan statistic was used for cluster detection (SaTScan (TM), v. 9.1.1). Identified clusters were visualized in Quantum Geographic Information Systems software (v1.8.0). The following cluster centers were tested: a health centre with the highest TB and MDR-TB rates (Clinic X), a hospital and two prisons. Using regression analyses, we examined predictors of primary MDR-TB cases. RESULTS: A statistically significant cluster of primary MDR-TB cases was identified within a 2.29 km radius around Clinic X. Proximity to Clinic X remained a significant predictor of primary MDR-TB in adjusted regression analyses. CONCLUSION: We identified a hotspot of primary MDR-TB cases around Clinic X in a TB-endemic area. Causes of this clustering require investigation; targeted interventions for this high-risk area should be considered.	spatial; clusters; urban; high risk; hotspot	HTLV-1 INFECTION; TRANSMISSION; COMMUNITY; MONTREAL; BURDEN
10.5588_ijtld.14.0106	Detection and management of drug-resistant tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients in lower-income countries	SETTING: Drug resistance threatens tuberculosis (TB) control, particularly among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected persons. OBJECTIVE: To describe practices in the prevention and management of drug-resistant TB under antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs in lower-income countries. DESIGN: We used online questionnaires to collect program-level data on 47 ART programs in Southern Africa (n=14), East Africa (n=8), West Africa (n=7), Central Africa (n=5), Latin America (n=7) and the Asia-Pacific (n=6 programs) in 2012. Patient-level data were collected on 1002 adult TB patients seen at 40 of the participating ART programs. RESULTS: Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) was available in 36 (77%) ART programs, but was only used for 22% of all TB patients. Molecular DST was available in 33 (70%) programs and was used in 23% of all TB patients. Twenty ART programs (43%) provided directly observed therapy (DOT) during the entire course of treatment, 16 (34%) during the intensive phase only, and 11(23%) did not follow DOT. Fourteen (30%) ART programs reported no access to second-line anti-tuberculosis regimens; 18 (38%) reported TB drug shortages. CONCLUSIONS: Capacity to diagnose and treat drug-resistant TB was limited across ART programs in lower-income countries. DOT was not always implemented and drug supplies were regularly interrupted, which may contribute to the global emergence of drug resistance.

10.1371_journal.pone.0110461	Alarming Levels of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in HIV-Infected Patients in Metropolitan Mumbai, India	Background: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is a looming threat to tuberculosis control in India. However, no countrywide prevalence data are available. The burden of DR-TB in HIV-co-infected patients is likewise unknown. Undiagnosed and untreated DR-TB among HIV-infected patients is a major cause of mortality and morbidity. We aimed to assess the prevalence of DR-TB (defined as resistance to any anti-TB drug) in patients attending public antiretroviral treatment (ART) centers in greater metropolitan Mumbai, India. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among adults and children ART-center attendees. Smear microscopy, culture and drug-susceptibility-testing (DST) against all first and second-line TB-drugs using phenotypic liquid culture (MGIT) were conducted on all presumptive tuberculosis patients. Analyses were performed to determine DR-TB prevalence and resistance patterns separately for new and previously treated, culture-positive TB-cases. Results: Between March 2013 and January 2014, ART-center attendees were screened during 14135 visits, of whom 1724 had presumptive TB. Of 1724 attendees, 72 (4%) were smear-positive and 202 (12%) had a positive culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Overall DR-TB was diagnosed in 68 (34%, 95% CI: 27%-40%) TB-patients. The proportions of DR-TB were 25% (29/114) and 44% (39/88) among new and previously treated cases respectively. The patterns of DR-TB were: 21% mono-resistant, 12% poly-resistant, 38% multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB), 21% pre-extensively-drug-resistant (MDR-TB plus resistance to either a fluoroquinolone or second-line injectable), 6% extensively drug-resistant (XDR-TB) and 2% extremely drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB plus resistance to any group-IV/V drug). Only previous history of TB was significantly associated with the diagnosis of DR-TB in multivariate models. Conclusion: The burden of DR-TB among HIV-infected patients attending public ART-centers in Mumbai was alarmingly high, likely representing ongoing transmission in the community and health facilities. These data highlight the need to promptly diagnose drug-resistance among all HIV-infected patients by systematically offering access to first and second-line DST to all patients with 'presumptive TB' rather than 'presumptive DR-TB' and tailor the treatment regimen based on the resistance patterns.

10.1186_1471_2334_14_542	Successful MDR-TB treatment regimens including Amikacin are associated with high rates of hearing loss	Background: Aminoglycosides are a critical component of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment but data on their efficacy and adverse effects in Botswana is scarce. We determined the effect of amikacin on treatment outcomes and development of hearing loss in MDR-TB patients. Methods: Patients started on MDR-TB treatment between 2006 and 2012 were included. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the effect of amikacin on treatment outcomes and development of hearing loss. Results: 437 MDR-TB patients were included, 288 (66%) of whom were HIV co-infected. 270 (62%) developed hearing loss, of whom 147 (54%) had audiometry. Of the 313 (72%) patients who completed treatment, 228 (73%) had a good outcome (cure or treatment completion). Good outcome was associated with longer amikacin treatment (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.13, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.21) and higher dosage (aOR 1.90, 95% CI 1.12 - 2.99). Longer amikacin duration (aOR 1.98, 95% CI 1.86 - 2.12) and higher dosage per weight per month (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04 - 1.28) were associated with development of hearing loss. Amikacin treatment duration modified the effect of the dosage on the risk of hearing loss, increasing this risk as the duration increased. Conclusions: Amikacin was effective for MDR-TB treatment, but was associated with a high incidence of hearing loss especially in our study population. Total treatment duration and average monthly amikacin dose were associated with improved outcomes; however these were also associated with development of hearing loss.

10.1016_j.jtbi.2014.05.023	Construction of a mathematical model for tuberculosis transmission in highly endemic regions of the Asia-pacific	We present a mathematical model to simulate tuberculosis (TB) transmission in highly endemic regions of the Asia-Pacific, where epidemiology does not appear to be primarily driven by HIV-coinfection. The ten-compartment deterministic model captures many of the observed phenomena important to disease dynamics, including partial and temporary vaccine efficacy, declining risk of active disease following infection, the possibility of reinfection both during the infection latent period and after treatment, multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and de novo resistance during treatment. We found that the model could not be calibrated to the estimated incidence rate without allowing for reinfection during latency, and that even in the presence of a moderate fitness cost and a lower value of R-0, MDR-TB becomes the dominant strain at equilibrium. Of the modifiable programmatic parameters, the rate of detection and treatment commencement was the most important determinant of disease rates with each respective strain, while vaccination rates were less important. Improved treatment of drug-susceptible TB did not result in decreased rates of MDR-TB through prevention of de novo resistance, but rather resulted in a modest increase in MDR-TB through strain replacement. This was due to the considerably greater relative contribution of community transmission to MDR-TB incidence, by comparison to de novo amplification of resistance in previously susceptible strains.

pub-0737	Detection of multi-drug resistance & characterization of mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from North-eastern states of India using GenoType MTBDRplus assay	Background & objectives: information on drug resistance tuberculosis is sparse from North-East (N-E) States of India. We undertook this study to detect multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) among MDR-TB suspects, and common mutations among MDR-TB cases using GenoType MTBDRplus. Methods: All MDR suspect patients deposited sputum samples to peripheral designated microscopy centres (DMC) in North-East States. The district TB officers (DTOs) facilitated the transport of samples collected during January 2012 to August 2012 to our laboratory. The line probe assay to detect common mutations in the rpoB gene for rifampicin (RIF) and katG and inhA genes for isoniazid (INH), respectively was performed on 339 samples or cultures. Results: A total of 553 sputum samples from MDR suspects were received of which, 181 (32.7%) isolates were found to be multi-drug resistant. Missing WT8 along with mutation in codon S531L was commonest pattern for rifampicin resistant isolates (65.1%) and missing WT8 along with mutations in codon S315T1 of katG gene was commonest pattern for isoniazid resistant isolates (86.2%). Average turn-around time for dispatch of LPA result to these states from cultures and samples was 23.4 and 5.2 days, respectively. Interpretations & conclusions: The MDR-TB among MDR-TB suspects in North-Eastern States of India was found to be 32.7 per cent. The common mutations obtained for RIF and INH in the region were mostly similar to those reported earlier.

10.1111_1469_0691.12696	Rapid diagnosis of pyrazinamide-resistant multidrug-resistant tuberculosis using a molecular-based diagnostic algorithm	There is an urgent need for rapid and accurate diagnosis of pyrazinamide-resistant multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). No diagnostic algorithm has been validated in this population. We hypothesized that pncA sequencing added to rpoB mutation analysis can accurately identify patients with pyrazinamide-resistant MDR-TB. We identified from the Dutch national database (2007-11) patients with a positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture containing a mutation in the rpoB gene. In these cases, we prospectively sequenced the pncA gene. Results from the rpoB and pncA mutation analysis (pncA added to rpoB) were compared with phenotypic susceptibility testing results to rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide (reference standard) using the Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube 960 system. We included 83 clinical M.tuberculosis isolates containing rpoB mutations in the primary analysis. Rifampicin resistance was seen in 72 isolates (87%), isoniazid resistance in 73 isolates (88%) and MDR-TB in 65 isolates (78%). Phenotypic reference testing identified pyrazinamide-resistant MDR-TB in 31 isolates (48%). Sensitivity of pncA sequencing added to rpoB mutation analysis for detecting pyrazinamide-resistant MDR-TB was 96.8%, the specificity was 94.2%, the positive predictive value was 90.9%, the negative predictive value was 98.0%, the positive likelihood was 16.8 and the negative likelihood was 0.03. In conclusion, pyrazinamide-resistant MDR-TB can be accurately detected using pncA sequencing added to rpoB mutation analysis. We propose to include pncA sequencing in every isolate with an rpoB mutation, allowing for stratification of MDR-TB treatment according to pyrazinamide susceptibility.

10.1128_AAC.02784_14	Linezolid Manifests a Rapid and Dramatic Therapeutic Effect for Patients with Life-Threatening Tuberculous Meningitis	We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with MRC grade II/III tuberculous meningitis (TBM) who accepted a background antitubercular regimen (BR) with or without linezolid (LZD). At the 4th week, the LZD-BR group achieved a faster and higher percentage of Glasgow coma scale recovery and temperature recovery, a higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/blood glucose ratio, and lower CSF white blood cell counts than did the BR group. Short-term linezolid supplementation may be a more effective treatment for life-threatening TBM.

10.1016_j.meegid.2014.06.017	Multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex genetic diversity and clues on recent transmission in Punjab, Pakistan	"Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB), i.e. bacilli resistant to rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH), is a major Public Health concern in Pakistan according to WHO estimates (3.5% and 32% of new and retreated cases, respectively). Previous Pakistanis reports identified a correlation between being MDR and belonging to Beijing or EAI lineages in one study, and belonging to ""H4""-Ural Euro-American sublineage in another study. In addition, MDR-TB transmission was suspected in Karachi. We tested MDR characteristics on a Punjab sample of 278 clinical isolates (without selection for Multi-Drug Resistance) including new and retreated cases collected from 2008 to 2012. All samples were characterized by a new, microbead-based method named ""TB-SPRINT"" (molecular diagnostic including spoligotype identification, and genetic resistance determinants to first-line anti-TB drugs RIF and INH). Isolates from 2011 to 2012 (n = 100) were further analyzed using 24-loci MIRU-VNTR. We detected 8.7% MDR isolates (CI95% = [5.0; 12.5]), mainly among CAS lineage that predominates in this central-East region of Pakistan. Out of 20 MDR-TB cases, 12 different TB-SPRINT profiles were identified, limiting the suspicion of MDR-TB transmission. 24 MIRU-VNTR confirmed the unrelatedness of isolates with different TB-SPRINT profiles and discriminated 3 isolates with identical TB-SPRINT profiles. In conclusion, our study did not confirm any of the correlations between Multi-Drug Resistance and lineage or sublineage in Punjab, Pakistan. MDR-TB isolates were diverse indicating that transmission is not pervasive. TB-SPRINT proved useful as a first step for detecting MDR-TB likely transmission events, before more extensive genotyping such as 15 or 24 MIRU-VNTR and thorough epidemiological investigation.

10.4103_0255_0857.142245	Rapid screening of rpoB and katG mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates by high-resolution melting curve analysis	Background: Early detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is essential to prevent its transmission in the community and initiate effective anti-TB treatment regimen. Materials and Methods: High-resolution melting curve (HRM) analysis was evaluated for rapid detection of resistance conferring mutations in rpoB and katG genes. We screened 95 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates including 20 rifampin resistant (RIF-R), 21 isoniazid resistant (INH-R) and 54 fully susceptible (S) isolates determined by proportion method of drug susceptibility testing. Nineteen M. tuberculosis isolates with known drug susceptibility genotypes were used as references for the assay validation. The nucleotide sequences of the target regions rpoB and katG genes were determined to investigate the frequency and type of mutations and to confirm HRM results. Results: HRM analysis of a 129-bp fragment of rpoB allowed correct identification of 19 of the 20 phenotypically RIF-R and all RIF-S isolates. All INH-S isolates generated wild-type HRM curves and 18 out of 21 INH-R isolates harboured any mutation in 109-bp fragment of katG exhibited mutant type HRM curves. However, 1 RIF-R and 3 INH-R isolates were falsely identified as susceptible which were confirmed for having no mutation in their target regions by sequencing. The main mutations involved in RIF and INH resistance were found at codons rpoB531 (60% of RIF-R isolates) and katG315 (85.7% of INH-R isolates), respectively. Conclusion: HRM was found to be a reliable, rapid and low cost method to characterise drug susceptibility of clinical TB isolates in resource-limited settings.

10.1302_0301_620X.96B10.34048	GeneXpert polymerase chain reaction for spinal tuberculosis	The lack of an accurate, rapid diagnostic test for mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is a major handicap in the management of spinal TB. GeneXpert, a new, rapid molecular diagnostic test is recommended as the first line investigation for suspected pulmonary TB in areas with a high prevalence of HIV or drug resistance, yet it has not been validated for the diagnosis of musculoskeletal TB. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of GeneXpert in diagnosing spinal TB. A prospective clinical study of 69 consecutive adults with suspected spinal TB was conducted at a tertiary hospital in an area with the highest incidence and prevalence of TB in the world. GeneXpert was used on tissue samples of the enrolled patients and its diagnostic accuracy compared with a reference standard of tissue in liquid culture. A total of 71 spine samples from 69 patients (two re-biopsies) were included in the study. The GeneXpert test showed a sensitivity of 95.6% and specificity of 96.2% for spinal TB. The results of the GeneXpert test were available within 48 hours compared with a median of 35 days (IQR 15 to 43) for cultures. All cases of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR TB) were diagnosed accurately with the GeneXpert test. The MDR TB rate was 5.8%.		DIAGNOSIS
10.4269_ajtmh.14_0161	Treatment Outcomes for Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Post-Earthquake Port-au-Prince, Haiti	We report outcomes and 12-month survival for the first cohort of patients to undergo multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment after the earthquake in Haiti. From March 3, 2010 to March 28, 2013, 110 patients initiated treatment of laboratory-confirmed MDR-TB at the Groupe Haftien d'Etude du Sarcome de Kaposi et des Infections Opportunistes (GHESKIO) Center in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Twenty-seven patients (25%) were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive. As of October 31, 2013, 95 (86%) patients were either cured or alive on treatment, 4 (4%) patients defaulted, and 11 (10%) patients died. Culture conversion occurred by 30 days in 14 (13%) patients, 60 days in 49 (45%) patients, and 90 days in 81 (74%) patients. The probabilities of survival to 12 months were 96% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 89-99) and 85% (95% CI = 64-94) for HIV-negative and -positive patients, respectively. Despite adverse conditions, outcomes for patients with MDR-TB are highly encouraging. Major efforts are underway to scale up community directly observed therapy and expand care to other regions of Haiti.		THERAPY; MANAGEMENT
10.5588_ijtld.13.0075	High cure rate with standardised short-course multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment in Niger: no relapses	SETTING: Niger National Tuberculosis Programme. Regions supported by the Damien Foundation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a short-course standardised treatment regimen for patients with proven multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) previously untreated with second-line drugs. METHODS: Prospective study including all patients enrolled from 2008 to 2010. The 12-month standardised regimen comprised high doses of gatifloxacin, clofazimine, ethambutol and pyrazinamide throughout, supplemented by kanamycin, prothionamide and medium-high doses of isoniazid during the intensive phase of a minimum of 4 months. Patients were monitored using sputum smear and culture at start of treatment and every 2 months. Cured patients were followed up 6-monthly for 24 months. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients with MDR-TB were included and analysed. One of 58 patients tested for human immunodeficiency virus (1.7%) infection was positive. Twenty-five patients (39.7%) were severely affected (body mass index <= 16 kg/m(2)). Cure was achieved in 58 patients (89.2%, 95%CI 81.7-96.7), 6 died and 1 defaulted. All 49 patients assessed at the 24-month follow-up after cure remained smear- and culture-negative. The main adverse events were vomiting (26.2%) and hearing impairment (20%), but no treatment had to be stopped. CONCLUSION: Standardised 12-month treatment for MDR-TB was highly effective and well tolerated in patients not previously exposed to second-line drugs in Niger.

10.5588_ijtld.14.0192	Drug-resistant tuberculosis in Israel: risk factors and treatment outcomes	SETTING: All culture-positive tuberculosis (TB) isolates in Israel. OBJECTIVES: To outline the magnitude of drug-resistant TB in Israel, describe treatment outcomes and identify risk factors. DESIGN: Retrospective study of laboratory data of all strains of adult TB patients tested for resistance to first- and second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs between 1999 and 2010. RESULTS: Of 4652 reported TB cases, 3552 (76.3%) underwent culture (annual range 73-81%); 445 (12.5%) were resistant to one or more first-line drugs, while 207 (5.8%) had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Risk factors for MDR-TB included being male, age 30-59 years, migrants (mainly from the former Soviet Union [FSU]) who had stayed in Israel >2 years, and having pulmonary TB, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and sputum smear positivity. Of all MDR-TB patients, 71.0% achieved treatment success, while 19.8% died. Twelve Israeli citizens had extensively drug-resistant TB (5.8% of MDR-TB cases). All had emigrated from the FSU and had pulmonary TB; 1 was HIV-infected. Seven (58.4%) achieved treatment success and 5 (41.6%) died. CONCLUSIONS: Drug-resistant TB in Israel is influenced by migration, especially from the FSU, where the patients were probably infected. Rapid sputum sampling performed in the early stages of the disease, patient isolation and drug susceptibility testing should be the standard of care to avoid further transmission and improve TB control.	drug resistance; immigration; laboratory; mycobacteriology; tuberculosis	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; UPDATED ANALYSIS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; SURVEILLANCE; IMMIGRATION
10.1371_journal.pone.0108591	I Can Also Serve as an Inspiration'': A Qualitative Study of the TB&Me Blogging Experience and Its Role in MDR-TB Treatment	"Background: In 2011, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) established a blogging project, ""TB&Me,'' to enable patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) to share their experiences. By September 2012, 13 MDR-TB patients had blogged, either directly or with assistance, from the UK, Australia, Philippines, Swaziland, Central African Republic, Uganda, South Africa, India, and Armenia. Due to the lack of research on the potential for social media to support MDR-TB treatment and the innovative nature of the blog, we decided to conduct a qualitative study to examine patient and staff experiences. Our aim was to identify potential risks and benefits associated with blogging to enable us to determine whether social media had a role to play in supporting patients with MDR-TB. Methods and Findings: Participants were identified and selected purposively. TB&Me bloggers, project staff, MSF headquarters staff involved with TB and WHO European Region TB policy advisors were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview. Twenty interviews were conducted (five with bloggers). Data analysis drew upon principles of grounded theory, with constant comparison of data, cases and categories, and attention to deviant cases. We found that the TB&Me blog was associated with identified health benefits, with no reported instances of harm. There were three main findings: blogging was reported as useful for adherence to DR-TB treatment and supportive of the treatment-taking process by all bloggers and project staff; blogging provided support to patients (peer support, shared experience and reduction in isolation); and the blog was perceived as giving patients strength and voice. Conclusion: The TB&Me blog was seen to be associated with positive identified health and emotional benefits. Component 5 of the Stop TB Global Plan highlights the importance of empowering TB patients and communities. Blogging could be a useful tool to help achieve that ambition."

10.1186_1745_6215_15_353	Evaluation of a standardized treatment regimen of anti-tuberculosis drugs for patients with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (STREAM): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial	Background: In contrast to drug-sensitive tuberculosis, the guidelines for the treatment of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) have a very poor evidence base; current recommendations, based on expert opinion, are that patients should be treated for a minimum of 20 months. A series of cohort studies conducted in Bangladesh identified a nine-month regimen with very promising results. There is a need to evaluate this regimen in comparison with the currently recommended regimen in a randomized controlled trial in a variety of settings, including patients with HIV-coinfection. Methods/Design: STREAM is a multi-centre randomized trial of non-inferiority design comparing a nine-month regimen to the treatment currently recommended by the World Health Organization in patients with MDR pulmonary TB with no evidence on line probe assay of fluoroquinolone or kanamycin resistance. The nine-month regimen includes clofazimine and high-dose moxifloxacin and can be extended to 11 months in the event of delay in smear conversion. The primary outcome is based on the bacteriological status of the patients at 27 months post-randomization. Based on the assumption that the nine-month regimen will be slightly more effective than the control regimen and, given a 10% margin of non-inferiority, a total of 400 patients are required to be enrolled. Health economics data are being collected on all patients in selected sites. Discussion: The results from the study in Bangladesh and cohorts in progress elsewhere are encouraging, but for this regimen to be recommended more widely than in a research setting, robust evidence is needed from a randomized clinical trial. Results from the STREAM trial together with data from ongoing cohorts should provide the evidence necessary to revise current recommendations for the treatment for MDR-TB.

10.1186_1471_2334_14_481	Rifampicin resistance mutations in the 81 bp RRDR of rpoB gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates using Xpert (R) MTB/RIF in Kampala, Uganda: a retrospective study	Background: Introduction of Xpert r MTB/RIF assay has revolutionalised the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) by simultaneously detecting the bacteria and resistance to rifampicin (rif), a surrogate marker for multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) as well as one of the principal first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. In general, rpoB mutations can be found in 96.1% of rif-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains worldwide and these mutations usually are located in a region at the 507-533rd amino acid residuals (81 bp) in the MTB rpoB gene, which is referred to as Rifampicin-resistance-determining region (RRDR). In this study, we determined the frequency of MDR-TB in Kampala using Xpert r MTB/RIF in comparison with the agar proportion method using Middlebrook 7H11and further determined the frequency of probes for different rpoB gene mutations using Xpert r MTB/RIF assay in the 81 bp RRDR. Methods: A total of 1501 specimens received at Mycobacteriology laboratory, Makerere University for Xpert testing between May 2011 and May 2014 were analysed by Xpert r MTB/RIF assay. Specimens that were positive for both MTB and rifampicin resistance were further subjected to a complete first line anti-mycobacterial drug susceptibility testing using Middlebrook 7H11 agar proportion method (APM). Results: Xpert r MTB/RIF assay detected 313 MTB positive specimens and out of which 12 specimens had both MTB and rifampicin-resistance conferred by four different rpoB gene mutations in the 81 bp-RRDR of MTB, further one (1/12), specimen was found to be rifampicin mono-resistant on APM while the 11 were found to be MDR-TB. Probes associated with the observed rif-resistance were as follows: E (7/12), B (3/12), A (1/12), D (1/12) and no rif-resistance was associated with probe C. No specimen yielded rif-resistance associated with more than one probe failure (mutation combinations). Probe D was associated with rifampicin mono-resistant. Conclusions: MDR-TB was at 3.5% in the studied population. Mutations associated with Probe E (58%) also known as codons 531and 533 are the commonest rpoB gene mutation identified by Xpert r MTB/RIF assay in this setting and mutations identified by probe E of the assay, turned out to be MDR-TB strains by agar proportion method antimicrobial susceptibility testing. No mutation was detected in the codon 522.

10.1093_trstmh_tru080	Long term outcome of multidrug-resistant TB patients in Fukujuji Hospital in Japan	Objective: To present the long-term outcome of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) patients. Methods: An observational study of 291 MDR TB cases that were diagnosed from 1990 to 2011 at the Fukujuji Hospital in Japan. Results: The frequency of relapse after cure was 3/168 (1.8%) during a mean follow-up of 4.4 years. Among 16 failure cases, eight patients were negative in later years. One case among the nine lost-to-follow-up patients with culture conversion returned 1.5 years later with positive culture. Conclusions: Chronic-positive patients remain positive for years and require observation. Lost to follow-up cases may relapse.	Japan; Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; Tuberculosis	TUBERCULOSIS
10.1016_j.tube.2014.05.002	Diagnostic performance of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for tuberculous lymphadenitis on fine needle aspirates from Ethiopia	The Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) test is a novel automated molecular diagnostic recently endorsed by the World Health Organization for rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). Nevertheless, performance related data from high TB prevalence regions to investigate clinically suspected TB lymphadenitis are limited. To evaluate the performance of Xpert test for direct detection of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and rifampicin (RIF) resistance in lymph node aspirates, a cross-sectional study was conducted at four main hospitals in northern Ethiopia. Culture served as a reference standard for growth of MTBC and phenotypic and MTBDRplus drug susceptibility testing for detecting RIF resistance. Two-hundred-thirty-one fine needle aspirate (FNAs) specimens were processed simultaneously for smear, culture, and Xpert test. When compared to culture, the Xpert test correctly identified 29 out of 32 culture positive cases, 5 out of 11 contaminated cases, and 56 out of 188 culture negative cases. The overall sensitivity of the test was 93.5% [95% CI, 78.3-98.9%] and specificity 69.2% [95% CI, 66.4-70.0%]. The Xpert test identified the rpoB mutations associated with RIF resistance concordant with GenoType MTBDRplus and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing. In conclusion, the Xpert assay was found to perform well in detecting MTBC and RIF resistance in TB lymphadenitis patients. Furthermore, the test is simple and suitable to use in remote and rural areas for the diagnosis of TB lymphadenitis directly from FNAs in Ethiopia where TB/MDR-TB is rampant. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

pub-0751	PCR-SSCP analysis in detecting point mutations targeting rpoB, katG and inhA genes for determining multi-drug resistance in Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains	The usefulness of polymerase chain reaction-single stranded confirmation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) for determination of rifampicin and isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. bovis cultures from human and animal origin was investigated. Mycobacteria (81) in the study included, were 12 MDR-TB samples, 35 sputum samples, 3 lung and lymph node tissues from bovines and 11 M. tuberculosis and 18 M. bovis culture, M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. bovis BCG strain. All the mycobacterial cultures were characterized on growth characteristics, biochemical test pattern, MTB complex specific IS6110 PCR and species specific 12.7 kb multiplex PCR. PCR-SSCP was used to determine resistance against rifiampin by targeting rpoB gene (305bp) and isoniazid by targeting katG (237bp) and inhA (261 bp). Rifampicin resistance was detected by PCR-SSCP in 1 out of 12 MDR-TB samples (8.3%), while isoniazid resistance was detected in 66.7% of MDR-TB samples using PCR-SSCP of katG and 75% of MDR-TB samples using inhA SSCP analysis.

10.3109_10717544.2013.851302	Microparticles of rifampicin: comparison of pulmonary route with oral route for drug uptake by alveolar macrophages, phagocytosis activity and toxicity study in albino rats	Context: Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease with increasing incidence of drug resistance. Oral treatment for TB and multidrug resistance (MDR)-TB can have serious side effects. The causative agent of TB, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, resides in alveolar macrophages (AM). Pulmonary administration of anti-TB drugs can help in delivery of high concentration to AM. The ability of AM to phagocytose can also be utilized to generate mycobactericidal nitric oxide (NO) to improve efficacy of anti-TB drugs. Objective: To compare the uptake of rifampicin (RIF) by AM post oral and pulmonary administration of RIF microparticles (RM) and to compare hepatotoxicity and phagocytosis activity. Materials and Methods: RM were produced by spray drying process. RM were administered to rats through oral as well as intratracheal route. The uptake of RIF by AM and liver was measured. NO was measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. SGOT and SGPT levels were measured in serum. Results: Significantly higher (p < 0.05) concentration of RIF was found in AM post intratracheal administration. NO production was also significantly higher but less than toxic level. SGOT and SGPT levels as well as uptake of RIF by liver were indicative of no hepatotoxicity post intratracheal administration. Discussion: Phagocytosis of RM post intratracheal administration leads to significantly higher drug level in AM as well as production of significantly higher levels of NO. Conclusion: The administration of RM as dry powder inhalation (DPI) formulation may reduce treatment time of TB and chances of drug resistance TB.

10.5588_ijtld.13.0834	Rapid impact of effective treatment on transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	BACKGROUND: Effective treatment for drug-susceptible tuberculosis (TB) rapidly renders patients noninfectious, long before conversion of sputum acid-fast smear or culture to negative. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients on treatment are currently assumed to remain infectious for months. While the resources required for prolonged hospitalization are a barrier to the scale-up of MDR-TB treatment, the safety of community treatment is clear. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the impact of treatment on infectiousness among MDR-TB patients. METHODS: A series of five human-to-guinea pig TB transmission studies was conducted to test various interventions for infection control. Guinea pigs in adjacent chambers were exposed to exhaust air from a hospital ward occupied by mostly sputum smear- and culture-positive MDR-TB patients. The guinea pigs then underwent tuberculin skin testing for infection. Only the control groups of guinea pigs from each study (no interventions used) provide the data for this analysis. The number of guinea pigs infected in each study is reported and correlated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug susceptibility relative to treatment. RESULTS: Despite exposure to presumably infectious MDR-TB patients, infection percentages among guinea pigs ranged from 1% to 77% in the five experiments conducted. In one experiment in which guinea pigs were exposed to 27 MDR-TB patients newly started on effective treatment for 3 months, there was minimal transmission. In four other experiments with greater transmission, guinea pigs had been exposed to patients with unsuspected extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis who were not on effective treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In this model, effective treatment appears to render MDR-TB patients rapidly noninfectious. Further prospective studies on this subject are needed.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; impact of treatment; transmission; extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; TUBERCLE-BACILLI; SOUTH-AFRICA; CHEMOTHERAPY; INFECTION; VARIABILITY; SETTINGS; WARD
10.5588_ijtld.13.0749	Increase in anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in Botswana: results from the fourth National Drug Resistance Survey	SETTING: Although approximately 0.5 million cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) occur globally each year, surveillance data are limited. Botswana is one of the few high TB burden countries to have carried out multiple anti-tuberculosis drug resistance surveys (in 1995-1996, 1999 and 2002). OBJECTIVE: In 2007-2008, we conducted the fourth national survey of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in Botswana to assess anti-tuberculosis drug resistance, including trends over time. In the previous survey, 0.8% (95%CI 0.4-1.5) of new patients and 10.4% (95%CI 5.6-17.3) of previously treated patients had MDR-TB. DESIGN: During the survey period, eligible specimens from all new sputum-smear positive TB patients and from all TB patients with history of previous anti-tuberculosis treatment underwent mycobacterial culture and anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing (DST). RESULTS: Of 924 new TB patients and 137 with previous anti-tuberculosis treatment with DST results, respectively 23 (2.5%, 95% CI 1.6-3.7) and 9 (6.6%, 95%CI 3.3-11.7) had MDR-TB. The proportion of new TB patients with MDR-TB has tripled in Botswana since the previous survey. CONCLUSION: Combatting drug-resistant TB will require the scale-up of MDR-TB diagnosis and treatment to prevent the transmission of MDR-TB and strengthening of general TB control to prevent the emergence of resistance.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; surveillance	TUBERCULOSIS PATIENTS; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; SPUTUM SMEARS; HIV; EPIDEMIOLOGY; RISK
10.5588_ijtld.13.0857	Evaluation of the GenoType (R) MTBDRplus line probe assay on sputum-positive samples in routine settings in China	BACKGROUND: Rapid molecular methods have been recommended for early detection of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of the GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay in routine settings in China. METHODS: Sputum-positive samples were collected consecutively from 1 April to 31 December 2010. MTBDRplus results were compared to those of conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST). The McNemar chi(2) test and kappa coefficient were used to assess performance. RESULTS: Of 427 smear-positive sputum samples collected, conventional DST and MTBDTplus confirmed drug resistance in 326. The sensitivities and specificities for MTBDRplus in detecting isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP) resistance were respectively 76.47%, 95.44%, 85.94% and 93.13%. The McNemar chi(2) test indicated no significant difference between the two methods (P = 0.106 for INH and P = 0.083 for RMP). The kappa values for INH, RMP and multidrug resistance were respectively 0.75, 0.75 and 0.70. CONCLUSIONS: Although the MTBDRplus assay was moderately concordant with conventional DST in detecting INH and RMP resistance, as a prospective rapid molecular method for MDR-TB detection, potential resistant mutations need to be incorporated to improve the accuracy of detection.

10.1111_tmi.12347	Prescription patterns and treatment outcomes of MDR-TB patients treated within and outside the National Tuberculosis Programme in Pham Ngoc Thach hospital, Viet Nam	OBJECTIVE To describe and analyse the prescription patterns and treatment outcomes of MDR-TB patients managed within Green Light Committee (GLC) and outside (non-GLC) the National TB programme in Viet Nam. METHODS Retrospective cohort study with two elements: (i) in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with clinical doctors, hospital pharmacists, and the non-GLC patients with MDR-TB; (ii) review of treatment cards and patients' charts of all GLC and non-GLC patients with MDR-TB put on treatment during 2010. RESULTS Of 282 patients with MDR-TB, comprising 79 (28%) GLC patients MDR-TB and 203 (72%) non-GLC patients with MDR-TB, were enrolled in the study. Treatment delay was significantly higher in the GLC group (12.8 days) than the non-GLC group (2.3 days), (P = 0.004). The success rate was significantly better in GLC patients (84.8%) than in non-GLC patients (53.7%) (P < 0.001). The default rate was significantly higher in non-GLC patients than in GLC patients (25.6% vs. 6.3%), (P < 0.001). The risk of unsuccessful outcome was higher in non-GLC patients (Hazard ratio = 4.6, 95% CI: 1.8-11.8). CONCLUSIONS The treatment outcomes of patients with MDR-TB in the GLC group were significantly better than in the non-GLC group. Reasons for the high default rate in non-GLC patients with MDR-TB must be further investigated.	multidrug-resistant TB; Green Light Committee; private sector; treatment outcome	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS
10.5588_ijtld.14.0094	Management of paediatric tuberculosis in leading UK centres: unveiling consensus and discrepancies	SETTING: Large specialist paediatric TB clinics in the UK. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical practice and compare with national and international guidelines. DESIGN: A survey based on an electronic questionnaire on the management of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) and tuberculosis (TB) disease was conducted in 13 specialist paediatric TB clinics. The consensus and discrepancies were evaluated by descriptive analysis. RESULTS: Practice was reportedly different when choosing age limits for preventive treatment for TB contacts with initially negative tuberculin skin tests (TSTs), interpretation of TST results and use of interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) in the context of LTBI. In relation to management of children with TB disease, practices varied for duration of treatment of osteoarticular TB, monitoring for ethambutol ocular toxicity and use of pyridoxine. There was limited experience with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), and over half of the clinics monitored MDR-TB contacts without giving preventive treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The survey showed heterogeneity in several aspects of clinical care for children with TB. Available paediatric TB guidelines differ substantially, explaining the wide variations in management of childhood TB. Prospective paediatric studies are urgently required to inform and standardise clinical practice, especially in the context of evolving drug resistance.	children; clinical practice; guidelines	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; YOUNG-CHILDREN; INDUCED SPUTUM; DIAGNOSIS
10.5588_ijtld.14.0231	Malnutrition associated with unfavorable outcome and death among South African MDR-TB and HIV co-infected children	SETTING: Pediatric multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is complicated by difficult diagnosis, complex treatment, and high mortality. In South Africa, these challenges are amplified by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection; however, evidence on treatment outcomes among co-infected children is limited. OBJECTIVE: Using conventional and new pediatric definitions, to describe treatment outcomes and identify risk factors for unfavorable outcome and mortality in children aged <15 years with MDR-TB or extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study in a regional TB referral hospital. RESULTS: From January 2009 to June 2010, 84 children (median age 8 years, IQR 4-12) with MDR-TB (n = 78) or XDR-TB (n = 6) initiated treatment. Sixty-four (77%) were HTV-positive and 62 (97%) received antiretroviral therapy. Sixty-six (79%) achieved favorable treatment outcomes. Overall mortality was 11% (n = 9) at 18 months after initiation of treatment. Malnutrition (aOR 27.4, 95%CI 2.7-278.7) and severe radiographic findings (aOR 4.68, 95%CI 1.01-21.9) were associated with unfavorable outcome. New pediatric outcome definitions increased the proportion classified as cured. CONCLUSION: It is possible to successfully treat pediatric MDR-TB-HIV even in resource-poor settings. Malnutrition is a marker for severe TB-HIV disease, and is a potential target for future interventions in these patients.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; HIV/AIDS; pediatric	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; ACTIVE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; CHILDHOOD TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; CLINICAL-FEATURES; METAANALYSIS; SURVIVAL; BURDEN
10.1016_j.jsps.2013.12.005	Synthesis and evaluation of a pyrazinoic acid prodrug in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused mainly by infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis affecting more than ten million people around the world. Despite TB can be treated, the rise of MDR-TB and XDR-TB cases put the disease in a worrying status. As pyrazinamide-resistant strains exhibit low or none pyrazinamidase activity, it is proposed that the active form of pyrazinamide (PZA) is pyrazinoic acid (POA), although this acid has poor penetration in mycobacteria. In this work, we present a convenient one-pot synthesis of 2-chloroethyl pyrazinoate, and its activity in M. tuberculosis H(37)Rv (ATCC27294) in MIC assay using the MABA technique. The obtained MIC of the compound was 3.96 g/mL, and discussion about the activity profile of some previously evaluated pyrazinoates is also performed. (C) 2013 King Saud University.

10.1371_journal.pone.0105214	Development of Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis in Bangladesh: A Case-Control Study on Risk Factors	"Objective: To determine the risk factors for developing multidrug resistant tuberculosis in Bangladesh. Methods: This case-control study was set in central, district and sub-district level hospitals of rural and urban Bangladesh. Included were 250 multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients as cases and 750 drug susceptible tuberculosis patients as controls. We recruited cases from all three government hospitals treating MDR-TB in Bangladesh during the study period. Controls were selected randomly from those local treatment units that had referred the cases. Information was collected through face-to-face interviews and record reviews. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression were used to analyse the data. Results: Previous treatment history was shown to be the major contributing factor to MDR-TB in univariate analysis. After adjusting for other factors in multivariable analysis, age group ""18-25'' (OR 1.77, CI 1.07-2.93) and ""26-45'' (OR 1.72, CI 1.12-2.66), some level of education (OR 1.94, CI 1.32-2.85), service and business as occupation (OR 2.88, CI 1.29-6.44; OR 3.71, CI 1.59-8.66, respectively), smoking history (OR 1.58, CI 0.99-2.5), and type 2 diabetes (OR 2.56 CI 1.51-4.34) were associated with MDR-TB. Previous treatment was not included in the multivariable analysis as it was correlated with multiple predictors. Conclusion: Previous tuberculosis treatment was found to be the major risk factor for MDR-TB. This study also identified age 18 to 45 years, some education up to secondary level, service and business as occupation, past smoking status, and type 2 diabetes as comorbid illness as risk factors. National Tuberculosis programme should address these risk factors in MDR-TB control strategy. The integration of MDR-TB control activities with diabetes and tobacco control programmes is needed in Bangladesh."		DRUG-RESISTANCE; PREVALENCE; PAKISTAN
10.1186_1471_2334_14_442	Effects of introducing Xpert MTB/RIF test on multi-drug resistant tuberculosis diagnosis in KwaZulu-Natal South Africa	Background: An algorithm instituted following Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) introduction in South Africa advocates for treating all Xpert rifampicin resistant patients as MDR-TB cases while awaiting confirmation by phenotypic or genotypic drug susceptibility testing. This study evaluates how the Xpert has influenced the diagnosis and management of drug resistant TB in the highest burdened district of KwaZulu-Natal Province. Methods: Data was retrospectively collected from all patients with rifampicin resistance on Xpert performed between March 2011 and April 2012. Xpert results were compared with those of phenotypic and/genotypic drug susceptibility testing. Patients' records were used to determine the time to treatment initiation. Results: Out of 637 patients tested by Xpert, 50% had confirmatory results, of which a third were sent on the same day as Xpert test. The rate of rifampicin discordance and monoresistance was 8.8% and 13.4% respectively and there was no difference between phenotypic and genotypic confirmation. Among those who had been initiated on treatment, 28%, 40%, 21% and 8% of patients commenced within 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months and 3 months of Xpert testing respectively, while the remaining 3% were observed without treatment. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the importance of complying with the algorithm in confirming all Xpert rif resistant cases so as to ensure proper management of these patients. Despite the rapidity of the Xpert results, only about 70% of patients had been initiated treatment at one month. Therefore there is a definite need to improve the health systems in order to improve on these delays.

10.1038_emi.2014.61	Aspartate decarboxylase (PanD) as a new target of pyrazinamide in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a frontline anti-tuberculosis drug that plays a crucial role in the treatment of both drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). PZA is a prodrug that is converted to its active form, pyrazinoic acid (POA), by a nicotinamidase/pyrazinamidase encoded by the pncA gene, the mutation of which is the major cause of PZA resistance. Although RpsA (ribosomal protein S1, involved in trans-translation) has recently been shown to be a target of POA/PZA, whole-genome sequencing has identified mutations in the panD gene encoding aspartate decarboxylase in PZA-resistant strains lacking pncA and rpsA mutations. To gain more insight into a possible new target of PZA, we isolated 30 POA-resistant mutants lacking mutations in pncA and rpsA from M. tuberculosis in vitro, and whole-genome sequencing of 3 mutants identified various mutations in the panD gene. Additionally, sequencing analysis revealed that the remaining 27 POA-resistant mutants all harbored panD mutations affecting the C-terminus of the PanD protein, with PanD M117I being the most frequent mutation (24/30, 80%). Conditional overexpression of panD from M. tuberculosis, M. smegmatis or E. coli, or of M. tuberculosis mutant PanD M117I, all conferred resistance to POA and PZA in M. tuberculosis. beta-alanine and pantothenate, which are downstream products of PanD, were found to antagonize the antituberculosis activity of POA. In addition, the activity of the M. tuberculosis PanD enzyme was inhibited by POA at therapeutically relevant concentrations in a concentration-dependent manner but was not inhibited by the prodrug PZA or the control compound nicotinamide. These findings suggest that PanD represents a new target of PZA/POA. These results have implications for a better understanding of this peculiar persister drug and for the design of new drugs targeting M. tuberculosis persisters for improved treatment.

10.7196_SAMJ.8645	The HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa: Convergence with tuberculosis, socioecological vulnerability, and climate change patterns	Recent assessment reports suggest that climate change patterns are threatening social and ecological vulnerability and resilience, with the strong potential of negatively affecting human health. Persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) have weakened physiological responses and are immunologically vulnerable to pathogens and stressors in their environment, putting them at a health disadvantage in climate-based rising temperatures, water scarcity, air pollution, potential water-and vector-borne disease outbreaks, and habitat redistributions. These climatic aberrations may lead to increased surface drying and decreased availability of arable land, threatening food/nutrition security and sanitary water practices. Coupled with HIV/AIDS, climate change threatens ecological biodiversity via a larger-scale socioeconomic recourse to natural resources. Corresponding human and environmental activity shape conditions conducive to exacerbating high rates of HIV/AIDS. In South Africa, this epidemic is forming a 'syndemic' with tuberculosis (TB), which has come to include multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extremely drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) strains. Because of high convergence rates, one epidemic cannot be addressed without understanding the other. Concurrent climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies are becoming increasingly important to curb changes that negatively affect the biospheres on which civilisation is ultimately dependent - from an agricultural, a developmental, and especially a health standpoint. Mitigation strategies such as reducing carbon emissions are essential, but may be only partially effective in slowing the rate of surface warming. However, global climate assessments assert that these are not sufficient to halt climate change patterns. The roles of regionally specific climate research, socioecologically sustainable industrialisation paths for developing countries, and adoption of health system strengthening strategies are therefore vital.

10.1089_mdr.2013.0145	Factors Contributing to the High Prevalence of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Among Previously Treated Patients: A Case-Control Study from China	Setting: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has emerged as a serious global public health problem. In China, the risk factors for MDR-TB have not been systematically evaluated. Objective: To identify risk factors associated with MDR-TB among previously treated patients in China. Design: A case-control study was carried out. Cases were selected from previously treated MDR-TB patients who were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin, and controls were selected from previously treated TB patients who were sensitive to isoniazid and rifampin (non-MDR-TB). Information was collected from the registration database and a structured questionnaire. Results: A total of 61 cases and 50 controls were recruited. A multivariate analysis showed that the family annual per-capita income <= 7,000 Yuan (odds ratio [OR] = 3.238; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.270-8.252), no history of fixed dose combinations (FDCs) in anti-TB treatment (OR = 4.027; 95% CI: 1.457-11.129), and adverse reactions in the course of TB treatment (OR = 3.568; 95% CI: 1.402-9.085) were independent predictors of MDR-TB. Moreover, among the TB patients who had adverse reactions, quitting the treatment was shown as a risk factor for MDR-TB (p = 0.009). Conclusion: In the control of MDR-TB among previously treated patients, lower socioeconomic groups, the expanding use of FDCs, and improving adherence to treatment by implementing Directly Observed Therapy Short Course-Plus (DOTS-Plus), strictly should become a priority that requires strong commitment and collaboration among health organizations.

10.1186_1471_2334_14_426	Assessing the impact of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in children: an exploratory qualitative study	Background: While the prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) is high among children in the Western Cape of South Africa, the psychosocial implications of treatment for children with MDR-TB remain poorly understood. We sought to explore how MDR-TB and its treatment impact children on an individual, familial, and social level. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 children and caregivers purposively sampled from a prospective clinical cohort of children. The sample was stratified by age at the start of treatment (children >10 years, and 5-10 years). Caregiver proxy interviews were conducted with younger children, supplemented with child interviews; older children were interviewed directly, supplemented with caregiver proxy interviews. Data were analysed using grounded theory. Results: Findings revealed pill volume and adverse effects produced significant physical, psychological and academic disturbances in children. Adverse effects related to the medication were important obstacles to treatment adherence. While there appear to be no long-lasting effects in younger children, a few older children showed evidence of persisting internalised stigma. Caregivers suffered important treatment-related financial and psychological costs. Community support, notably through the continued involvement of children in strong social networks, promoted resilience among children and their families. Conclusions: We found that the current treatment regimen for childhood MDR-TB has significant psychological, academic, and financial impacts on children and their families. There is a need for psychosocial support of children and caregivers to mitigate the negative effects of community stigma, and to manage the stressors associated with chronic illness.

10.1007_s15010_014_0632_2	Linezolid in the treatment of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis	To investigate the linezolid (LZD) treatment outcome and correlation between in vitro susceptibility to LZD and clinical outcome. We retrospectively reviewed records of tuberculosis (TB) patients who received treatment with linezolid between March 2012 and February 2013. A total of 43 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB patients identified by drug susceptibility testing were enrolled in this study, including 15 (34.9 %) received LZD as part of individualized treatment regimens. Among the 43 XDR TB patients, 15 patients (34.9 %) obtained favorable clinical outcome, including 9 (60.0 %) from LZD group and 6 (21.4 %) from control group without LZD. Statistical analysis revealed that the percentage of favorable outcomes of LZD group was significantly higher than that of control group (P = 0.011). Furthermore, we analyzed the LZD minimum inhibitory concentrations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates from patients in LZD group and identified 4 (26.7 %) resistant to LZD. All of the patients with LZD resistance harbored adverse clinical outcome, while most of the patients infected with LZD sensitive MTB harbored favorable clinical outcome (81.8 %, 9/11). Statistical analysis revealed that the percentage of favorable outcome among the patients with LZD resistance was statistically lower than that among the LZD susceptible group (P = 0.011). This study demonstrates that linezolid has efficacy against XDR pulmonary TB patients, even in shorter duration of administration. The XDR TB patients infected with LZD-resistant isolates were more likely to obtain the adverse clinical outcome under the treatment of regimen containing LZD.

10.5588_ijtld.13.0028	Treatment for LTBI in contacts of MDR-TB patients, Federated States of Micronesia, 2009-2012	SETTING: Few studies have shown the operational feasibility, safety, tolerability, or outcomes of multidrug-resistant latent tuberculous infection (MDR LTBI) treatment. After two simultaneous multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) outbreaks in Chuuk, Federated States of Micronesia, infected contacts were offered a 12-month fluoroquinolone (FQ) based MDR LTBI treatment regimen. DESIGN: Between January 2009 and February 2012, 119 contacts of MDR-TB patients were followed using a prospective observational study design. After MDR-TB disease was excluded, 12 months of daily FQ-based preventive treatment of MDR LTBI was provided by directly observed therapy. RESULTS: Among the 119 infected contacts, 15 refused, while 104 began treatment for MDR LTBI. Of the 104 who initiated treatment, 93 (89%) completed treatment, while 4 contacts discontinued due to adverse effects. None of the 104 contacts who undertook MDR LTBI treatment of any duration developed MDR-TB disease; however, 3 of 15 contacts who refused and 15 unidentified contacts developed MDR-TB disease. CONCLUSION: Providing treatment for MDR LTBI can be accomplished in a resource-limited setting, and contributed to preventing MDR-TB disease. The Chuuk TB program implemented treatment of MDR LTBI with an 89% completion rate. The MDR LTBI regimens were safe and well tolerated, and no TB cases occurred among persons treated for MDR LTBI.	multidrug-resistant TB; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; TB prevention	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; METAANALYSIS; OUTBREAK; CHILDREN; THERAPY
10.5588_ijtld.13.0197	Second-line drug susceptibilities of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis strains isolated in Thailand: an update	The increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and the emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) globally hamper the successful treatment and effective control of TB. Information on second-line drug susceptibility, which is of utmost importance for patient care, is still limited. This study demonstrates the susceptibilities of 1447 strains of MDR-TB, including 58 XDR-TB strains, isolated from Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, ethionamide (ETH), para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) and linezolid. Results revealed that 93-94% of the MDR-TB strains were susceptible to aminoglycosides, 85-98% to fluoroquinolones, 78% to ETH, 85% to PAS and 99% to linezolid.	tuberculosis; resistance; anti-tuberculosis drug	
10.1128_JCM.00398_14	Pseudo-Outbreak of Pre-Extensively Drug-Resistant (Pre-XDR) Tuberculosis in Kinshasa: Collateral Damage Caused by False Detection of Fluoroquinolone Resistance by GenoType MTBDRsl	Fluoroquinolones are the core drugs for the management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Molecular drug susceptibility testing methods provide considerable advantages for scaling up programmatic management and surveillance of drug-resistant TB. We describe here the misidentification of fluoroquinolone resistance by the GenoType MTBDRsl (MTBDRsl) (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) line probe assay (LPA) encountered during a feasibility and validation study for the introduction of this rapid drug susceptibility test in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. The double gyrA mutation 80Ala and 90Gly represented 57% of all fluoroquinolone mutations identified from MDR-TB patient sputum samples, as confirmed by DNA sequencing. This double mutation was previously found to be associated with susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, yet it leads to absent hybridization of a wild-type band in the MTBDRsl and is thus falsely scored as resistance. Our findings suggest that MTBDRsl results must be interpreted with caution when the interpretation is based solely on the absence of a wild-type band without confirmation by visualization of a mutant band. Performance of the MTBDRsl LPA might be improved by replacing the gyrA wild-type probes by additional probes specific for well-documented gyrA mutations that confer clinically relevant resistance.

10.3934_rnbe.2014.11.971	THEORETICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE RELATIVE INCIDENCES OF SENSITIVE AND RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS EPIDEMIC IN PRESENCE OF DRUG TREATMENT	Despite the availability of effective treatment, tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global cause of mortality. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of TB that is resistant to at least two drugs used for the treatment of TB, and originally is developed when a case of drug-susceptible TB is improperly or incompletely treated. This work is concerned with a mathematical model to evaluate the effect of MDR-TB on TB epidemic and its control. The model assessing the transmission dynamics of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB includes slow TB (cases that result from endogenous reactivation of susceptible and resistant latent infections). We identify the steady states of the model to analyse their stability. We establish threshold conditions for possible scenarios: elimination of sensitive and resistant strains and coexistence of both. We find that the effective reproductive number is composed of two critical values, relative reproductive number for drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains. Our results imply that the potential for the spreading of the drug-resistant strain should be evaluated within the context of several others factors. We have also found that even the considerably less fit drug-resistant strains can lead to a high MDR-TB incidence, because the treatment is less effective against them.

10.1371_journal.pone.0103328	A Comparison of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment Commencement Times in MDRTBPlus Line Probe Assay and Xpert (R) MTB/RIF-Based Algorithms in a Routine Operational Setting in Cape Town	Background: Xpert MTB/RIF was introduced as a screening test for all presumptive tuberculosis cases in primary health services in Cape Town, South Africa. Study Aim: To compare multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment commencement times in MDRTBPlus Line Probe Assay and Xpert MTB/RIF-based algorithms in a routine operational setting. Methods: The study was undertaken in 10 of 29 high tuberculosis burden primary health facilities, selected through stratified random sampling. An observational study was undertaken as facilities transitioned to the Xpert MTB/RIF-based algorithm. MDR-TB diagnostic data were collected from electronic laboratory records and treatment data from clinical records and registers. Kaplan Meier time-to-event analysis was used to compare treatment commencement time, laboratory turnaround time and action delay between algorithms. A facility-level paired analysis was done: the median time-to-event was estimated per facility in each algorithm and mean differences between algorithms compared using a paired t-test. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the effect of patient-level variables on treatment commencement time. The difference between algorithms was compared using the hazard ratio. Results: The median treatment commencement time in the Xpert MTB/RIF-based algorithm was 17 days (95% CI 13 to 22 days), with a median laboratory turnaround time (to result available in the laboratory) of <1 day (95% CI<1 to 1 day). There was a decrease of 25 days (95% CI 17 to 32 days, p<0.001) in median MDR-TB treatment commencement time in the Xpert MTB/RIF-based algorithm. We found no significant effect on treatment commencement times for the patient-level variables assessed. Conclusion: MDR-TB treatment commencement time was significantly reduced in the Xpert MTB/RIF-based algorithm. Changes in the health system may have contributed. However, an unacceptable level of delay remains. Health system and patient factors contributing to delay need to be evaluated and addressed to optimise test benefits.

10.1371_journal.pone.0102989	Impact of Introducing the Line Probe Assay on Time to Treatment Initiation of MDR-TB in Delhi, India	Setting: National Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases (erstwhile Lala Ram Sarup Institute) in Delhi, India. Objectives: To evaluate before and after the introduction of the line Probe Assay (LPA) a) the overall time to MDR-TB diagnosis and treatment initiation; b) the step-by-step time lapse at each stage of patient management; and c) the lost to follow-up rates. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was done using data on MDR-TB patients diagnosed during 2009-2012 under Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme at the institute. Results: Following the introduction of the LPA in 2011, the overall median time from identification of patients suspected for MDR-TB to the initiation of treatment was reduced from 157 days (IQR 127-200) to 38 days (IQR 30-79). This reduction was attributed mainly to a lower diagnosis time at the laboratory. Lost to follow-up rates were also significantly reduced after introduction of the LPA (12% versus 39% pre-PLA). Conclusion: Introduction of the LPA was associated with a major reduction in the delay between identification of patients suspected for MDR-TB and initiation of treatment, attributed mainly to a reduction in diagnostic time in the laboratory.

10.1371_journal.pone.0102178	A Subset of Circulating Blood Mycobacteria-Specific CD4 T Cells Can Predict the Time to Mycobacterium tuberculosis Sputum Culture Conversion	We investigated 18 HIV-negative patients with MDR-TB for M. tuberculosis (Mtb)- and PPD-specific CD4 T cell responses and followed them over 6 months of drug therapy. Twelve of these patients were sputum culture (SC) positive and six patients were SC negative upon enrollment. Our aim was to identify a subset of mycobacteria- specific CD4 T cells that would predict time to culture conversion. The total frequency of mycobacteria-specific CD4 T cells at baseline could not distinguish patients showing positive or negative SC. However, a greater proportion of late-differentiated (LD) Mtb- and PPD-specific memory CD4 T cells was found in SC positive patients than in those who were SC negative (p = 0.004 and p = 0.0012, respectively). Similarly, a higher co-expression of HLA-DR(+)Ki67(+) on Mtb- and PPD-specific CD4 T cells could also discriminate between sputum SC positive versus SC negative ( p = 0.004 and p = 0.001, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that baseline levels of Ki67(+)HLA-DR+ Mtb- and PPD-specific CD4 T cells were predictive of the time to sputum culture conversion, with area-under-the-curve of 0.8 ( p = 0.027). Upon treatment, there was a significant decline of these Ki67(+)HLA-DR+ T cell populations in the first 2 months, with a progressive increase in mycobacteria-specific polyfunctional IFN gamma(+)IL2(+)TNF alpha(+) CD4 T cells over 6 months. Thus, a subset of activated and proliferating mycobacterial-specific CD4 T cells (Ki67(+)HLA-DR+) may provide a valuable marker in peripheral blood that predicts time to sputum culture conversion in TB patients at the start of treatment.

10.1371_journal.pone.0100082	Treatment Outcomes in Tuberculosis Patients with Diabetes: A Polytomous Analysis Using Brazilian Surveillance System	Background: The impact of non-communicable diseases on tuberculosis incidence has received significant attention. It has been suggested that the risk of tuberculosis is higher among subjects with diabetes and these subjects also has poor TB treatment outcomes. This study was aimed at assessing the socio-demographic and clinical factors that may influence different outcome of TB in patients with DM (TB-DM) identified in the Brazilian national database from 2001 to 2011. Methods: TB-DM cases reported in the Brazilian information system were identified and compared. Covariates associated with the outcomes of interest (cure, default, deaths, and development of TB MDR) were included in a hierarchical regression model. Results: TB-DM cases increased from 380/100,000/year in 2001 to 6,150/100,000/year in 2011. Some of the main associations found are pointed. The odds of default was higher among those in the age group 20-39 years (OR = 2.07, 95% CI 1.32-3.24); alcoholics (OR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.86-2.54), and HIV/AIDS (OR = 2.16, 95% CI 1.70-2.74); positive monitoring smear (OR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.55-2.43); prior default (OR = 5.41, 95% CI 4.47-6.54), and unknown type of treatment (OR = 3.33, 95% CI 1.54-7.22). The odds of death was greater for subjects >= 60 years old (OR = 2.74, 95% CI 1.74-4.29); institutionalized in shelter (OR = 2.69, 95% CI 1.07-6.77); alcoholics (OR = 2.70, 95% CI 2.27-3.22); HIV/AIDS (OR = 2.87, 95% CI 2.13-3.86); pulmonary+extrapulmonary TB (OR = 2.49, 95% CI 1.79-3.46); with unknown type of treatment (OR = 14.12, 95% CI 7.04-28.32). Development of MDR TB was more related to relapse (OR = 9.60, 95% CI 6.07-15.14); previous default (OR = 17.13, 95% CI 9.58-30.63); and transfer of treatment center (OR = 7.87, 95% CI 4.74-13.07). Conclusions: Older subjects and those with comorbidities and with a previous treatment of TB had poorest outcomes. TB control program in Brazil will need to expand efforts to focus on treatment of TB-DM patients to improve their cure rates in order to achieve the goals of tuberculosis elimination.

10.1186_1471_2334_14_360	Predictors of pulmonary tuberculosis treatment outcomes in South Korea: a prospective cohort study, 2005-2012	Background: Tuberculosis remains an important health concern in many countries. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of unfavorable outcomes at the end of treatment (EOT) and at the end of study (EOS; 40 months after EOT) in South Korea. Methods: New or previously treated tuberculosis patients were recruited into a prospective observational cohort study at two hospitals in South Korea. To identify predictors of unfavorable outcomes at EOT and EOS, logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: The proportion of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) was 8.2% in new cases and 57.9% in previously treated cases. Of new cases, 68.6% were cured, as were 40.7% of previously treated cases. At EOT, diabetes, >= 3 previous TB episodes, >= 1 significant regimen change, and MDR-TB were significantly associated with treatment failure or death. At EOS, age >= 35, body-mass index (BMI) < 18.5, diabetes, and MDR-TB were significantly associated with treatment failure, death, or relapse. Among cases that were cured at EOT, age >= 50 and a BMI < 18.5 were associated with subsequent death or relapse during follow-up to EOS. Treatment interruption was associated with service sector employees or laborers, bilateral lesions on chest X-ray, and previous treatment failure or treatment interruption history. Conclusions: Risk factors for poor treatment outcomes at EOT and EOS include both patient factors (diabetes status, age, BMI) and disease factors (history of multiple previous treatment episodes, MDR-TB). In this longitudinal, observational cohort study, diabetes mellitus and MDR-TB were risk factors for poor treatment outcomes and relapse. Measures to help ensure that the first tuberculosis treatment episode is also the last one may improve treatment outcomes.

10.4103_0377_4929.138738	Genotype MTBDR plus assay for molecular detection of rifampicin and isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Aim: This study was performed for the rapid identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and its resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid, directly from the sputum samples of pulmonary tuberculosis patients. Materials and Methods: A commercially available genotype MTBDR plus assay was used for the identification and detection of mutations in Mycobacterial isolates. A total of 100 sputum samples of pulmonary tuberculosis patients were analyzed by using the genotype MTBDR plus assay. The MTBDR plus assay is designed to detect the mutations in the hotspot region of rpoB gene, katG and regulatory region of inhA gene. Results: The genotype MTBDR plus assay detected 22% multidrug resistant (MDR), 2% rifampicin (RMP) monoresistant and 1% isoniazid (INH) monoresistant isolates. In 22 MDR isolates, the codons most frequently involved in RMP-associated mutations were codon 531 (54.55%), 516 (31.82%) and 526 (13.63%), and 90.90% of MDR isolates showed KatG S315T mutations and 9.1% showed inhA C-15T mutations associated with INH resistance. Conclusion: The new genotype MTBDR plus assay represents a rapid, reliable tool for the detection of MDR-TB, wherein results are obtained in 5 h allowing early and appropriate treatment, which is essential to cut the transmission path and reduce the spread of MDR-TB. The genotype MTBDR plus assay can readily be included in a routine laboratory work for the early diagnosis and control of MDR-TB.

10.4103_0255_0857.136561	Association of MDR-TB isolates with clinical characteristics of patients from Northern region of India	Purpose: We sought to determine the characteristics and relative frequency of transmission of MDR-TB in North India and their association with the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of TB-patients. Materials and Methods: To achieve the objectives PCR-SSCP, MAS-PCR and direct DNA sequencing were used against 101 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. Results: Multidrug-resistant-TB isolates were found to be significantly higher (P = 0.000) in previously treated patients in comparison to newly diagnosed patients. Further, significant differences (P = 0.003) were observed between different age groups (Mean +/- SD, 28.6 +/- 11.77) of the TB patients and multidrug resistance. Most frequent mutations were observed at codons 531 and 315 of rpoB and katG genes, respectively, in MDR-TB isolates. Conclusion: Routine surveillance of resistance to anti-TB drugs will improve timely recognition of MDR-TB cases and help prevent further transmission in Northern India.

10.1007_s40273_014_0159_5	Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Interventions for Tuberculosis Control: DALYs Versus QALYs	The emergence of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the European region and the high costs (nearly a,not sign536 million) generated by the nearly 72,000 notified TB cases in the EU are the factors driving the need for development and implementation of new tools against TB. In this context, cost-effectiveness analyses applying quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) or disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) as outcome measures for economic evaluation of improved approaches to TB control are increasingly important. While the methodology applied to derive the effectiveness data is commonly reported, less information is given regarding the derivation of utility weights in the calculation of QALYs for TB treatment. To date, despite the particular complexities of the disease, TB health effects have not been fully measured and there is no agreement on how disutility of TB disease should be accounted for. Consequently, disutility values in published studies vary considerably, and often appear to lack empirical evidence. As the need for a solid heath-economics rationale for investment in new tools against TB grows, adequate and comprehensive methods for assessing the impairments caused by different types of TB must be developed. Focusing on the assessment of DALYs as a measure of outcome in economic evaluation, we have built an exemplary model calculation applying the original TB data for Germany as reported to the Robert Koch Institute. Our work demonstrates that the use of standard equations provided in the scientific literature probably results in an underestimation of lost DALYs compared with probabilistic techniques. Providing distributions around epidemiological averages, coupled with Monte Carlo simulation to address uncertainty, may result in more realistic values. In line with a previous recommendation by the World Health Organization, it appears worthwhile to consider this more intricate approach to providing healthcare resource allocation decisions, particularly for TB.

pub-0779	Drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from tuberculosis lymphadenitis patients in Ethiopia	Background & objectives: The emergence of drug resistance tuberculosis (TB) is a significant challenge for TB control and prevention programmes, and the major problem is multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The present study was carried out to determine the frequency of drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates among newly and retreated TB lymphadenitis patients and risk factors for acquiring this infection. Methods: Two hundred twenty five M. tuberculosis isolates from TB lymphadenitis patients who were diagnosed as new and retreated tuberculosis cases between April 2012 and May 2012 were included in this study. Isolates were tested for susceptibility to isoniazed (INH), rifampicin (RMP), streptomycin (SM), ethambutol (EMB) and pyrazinamide (PZA) using the BacT/AlerT 3D system protocol. Results: Among 225 isolates, 15 (6.7%) were resistant to at least one first line anti-TB drug. Three (1.3%) were MDR-TB. Resistance to INH, RMP, SM, and EMB was found in 8 (3.6%), 4 (1.8%), 10 (4.4%), and 4 (1.8%) isolates, respectively. Of the 212 new TB lymphadenitis cases three (1.4%) were MDR-TB. A rifampicin resistant M. tuberculosis isolate was diagnosed from smear and culture negative newly treated cases. All isolates were susceptible to PZA. Matted cervical lymph nodes were the prominent sites involved. Newly treated TB lymphadenitis patients had a greater risk for presenting resistance to anti-TB drugs (p=0.046). Interpretation & conclusions: our study showed that TB lymphadenitis patients harboured drug resistant TB and MDR-TB, although at a low rate. Resistance was not associated with age, sex, patients' education and contact history. Further research is required to determine transmission dynamics of drug resistant strains.

10.1371_journal.pmed.1001674	The Importance of Implementation Strategy in Scaling Up Xpert MTB/RIF for Diagnosis of Tuberculosis in the Indian Health-Care System: A Transmission Model	Background: India has announced a goal of universal access to quality tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and treatment. A number of novel diagnostics could help meet this important goal. The rollout of one such diagnostic, Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) is being considered, but if Xpert is used mainly for people with HIV or high risk of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in the public sector, population-level impact may be limited. Methods and Findings: We developed a model of TB transmission, care-seeking behavior, and diagnostic/treatment practices in India and explored the impact of six different rollout strategies. Providing Xpert to 40% of public-sector patients with HIV or prior TB treatment (similar to current national strategy) reduced TB incidence by 0.2% (95% uncertainty range [UR]: -1.4%, 1.7%) and MDR-TB incidence by 2.4% (95% UR: -5.2%, 9.1%) relative to existing practice but required 2,500 additional MDR-TB treatments and 60 four-module GeneXpert systems at maximum capacity. Further including 20% of unselected symptomatic individuals in the public sector required 700 systems and reduced incidence by 2.1% (95% UR: 0.5%, 3.9%); a similar approach involving qualified private providers (providers who have received at least some training in allopathic or non-allopathic medicine) reduced incidence by 6.0% (95% UR: 3.9%, 7.9%) with similar resource outlay, but only if high treatment success was assured. Engaging 20% of all private-sector providers (qualified and informal [providers with no formal medical training]) had the greatest impact (14.1% reduction, 95% UR: 10.6%, 16.9%), but required >2,200 systems and reliable treatment referral. Improving referrals from informal providers for smear-based diagnosis in the public sector (without Xpert rollout) had substantially greater impact (6.3% reduction) than Xpert scale-up within the public sector. These findings are subject to substantial uncertainty regarding private-sector treatment patterns, patient care-seeking behavior, symptoms, and infectiousness over time; these uncertainties should be addressed by future research. Conclusions: The impact of new diagnostics for TB control in India depends on implementation within the complex, fragmented health-care system. Transformative strategies will require private/informal-sector engagement, adequate referral systems, improved treatment quality, and substantial resources.

10.1093_cid_ciu209	Improving Outcomes for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis: Aggressive Regimens Prevent Treatment Failure and Death	Background. Evidence is sparse regarding the optimal construction of regimens to treat multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis disease due to strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to at least both isoniazid and rifampin. Given the low potency of many second-line antituberculous drugs, we hypothesized that an aggressive regimen of at least 5 likely effective drugs during the intensive phase, including a fluoroquinolone and a parenteral agent, would be associated with a reduced risk of death or treatment failure. Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients initiating MDR tuberculosis treatment between 2000 and 2004 in Tomsk, Russian Federation. We used a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model to assess whether monthly exposure to an aggressive regimen was associated with the risk of death or treatment failure. Results. Six hundred fourteen individuals with confirmed MDR tuberculosis were eligible for analysis. On multivariable analysis that adjusted for extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis-MDR tuberculosis isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones and parenteral agents-we found that monthly exposure to an aggressive regimen was significantly associated with a lower risk of death or treatment failure (hazard ratio, 0.52 [95% confidence interval, .29-.94]; P =.030). Conclusions. Receipt of an aggressive treatment regimen was a robust predictor of decreased risk of death or failure during MDR tuberculosis treatment. These findings further support the use of this regimen definition as the benchmark for the standard of care of MDR tuberculosis patients and should be used as the basis for evaluating novel therapies.

10.1016_j.genhosppsych.2014.03.009	Cycloserine-induced psychosis in a young female with drug-resistant tuberculosis	Objective: To report a case of cycloserine-induced acute psychosis in a young female while on second line antitubercular treatment (ATT) for tubercular meningitis. Method: Case report. Results: A20-year-old female, known case of tubercular meningitis on ATT since 8 months, presented with a 10-days history of headache, vomiting, and photophobia. A provisional diagnosis of drug-resistant tuberculosis was made, and second-line ATT including cycloserine (750mg/day) and levofloxacin (750 mg/day) was added. Three days after the start of cycloserine and levofloxacin, the patient developed psychosis with delusions and hallucinations. Since the patient was on several drugs with potential to cause psychotic reaction, we considered a provisional diagnosis of drug-induced acute psychosis. Two days following cycloserine withdrawal, the patient improved significantly, and on the third day, she was absolutely normal with disappearance of psychotic symptoms. Conclusion: Our case highlights the importance of awareness regarding psychiatric adverse events of antitubercular agents and the reversible nature of the adverse events on drug withdrawal. We also suggest that caution should be exercised while administering cycloserine in MDR-TB patients because of a higher risk of psychiatric adverse events. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

10.5588_ijtld.13.0069	Trends in childhood drug-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa: a window into the wider epidemic?	Childhood tuberculosis (TB) is a marker of TB transmission within a community. We present the fourth consecutive survey of children with culture-confirmed TB at a hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, from 2009 to 2011. In comparison to the previous survey, the rate of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) has stabilised and the human immunodeficiency virus infection rate has declined. We also report on the first systematic surveillance of resistance to second-line drugs. Two concerns following from this are the high rate (22%) of ofloxacin resistance in MDR-TB isolates, and the discordance between isolates with an inhA promoter region mutation, usually implying ethionamide (ETH) resistance, and phenotypic ETH results in these isolates showing ETH susceptibility.

10.5588_ijtld.13.0591	Mortality of tuberculosis patients during treatment in Israel, 2000-2010	SETTING: Tuberculosis (TB) epidemiology in Israel is similar to that reported from other industrialised countries where most patients are foreign-born. OBJECTIVES: To assess TB case fatality rate (CFR) and mortality trends during treatment and to identify risk factors associated with mortality. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of all TB patients in Israel diagnosed between 2000 and 2010. Cause of death was classified by TB-specific and non-TB-specific causes. RESULTS: During the study period, 451 TB patients died during treatment, representing a CFR of 9.9%. Of these, 72.5% died due to TB-related causes, giving a TB-related CFR of 7.2%. Both the overall and TB-related CFR decreased over the study period. Risk factors for death included male sex, older age, human immunodeficiency virus coinfection, culture positivity and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Patients aged >= 65 years comprised 70% of the TB-related deaths, and more than half of these (54.9%) were born in the former Soviet Union, Europe (excluding the former Soviet Union) or the USA. CONCLUSION: Both the overall and TB-related CFR decreased over the study period. Physicians who treat older male TB patients with MDR-TB or HIV should increase the index of suspicion to include the possibility of a higher risk of mortality.	case fatality rate; death; Israel; mortality; tuberculosis	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; RISK-FACTORS; DEATH; INFECTION; IMMIGRATION; EUROPE; TRENDS
10.1371_journal.pmed.1001675	Defining Catastrophic Costs and Comparing Their Importance for Adverse Tuberculosis Outcome with Multi-Drug Resistance: A Prospective Cohort Study, Peru	"Background: Even when tuberculosis (TB) treatment is free, hidden costs incurred by patients and their households (TB-affected households) may worsen poverty and health. Extreme TB-associated costs have been termed ""catastrophic'' but are poorly defined. We studied TB-affected households' hidden costs and their association with adverse TB outcome to create a clinically relevant definition of catastrophic costs. Methods and Findings: From 26 October 2002 to 30 November 2009, TB patients (n = 876, 11% with multi-drug-resistant [MDR] TB) and healthy controls (n = 487) were recruited to a prospective cohort study in shantytowns in Lima, Peru. Patients were interviewed prior to and every 2-4 wk throughout treatment, recording direct (household expenses) and indirect (lost income) TB-related costs. Costs were expressed as a proportion of the household's annual income. In poorer households, costs were lower but constituted a higher proportion of the household's annual income: 27% (95% CI = 20%-43%) in the least-poor houses versus 48% (95% CI = 36%-50%) in the poorest. Adverse TB outcome was defined as death, treatment abandonment or treatment failure during therapy, or recurrence within 2 y. 23% (166/725) of patients with a defined treatment outcome had an adverse outcome. Total costs >= 20% of household annual income was defined as catastrophic because this threshold was most strongly associated with adverse TB outcome. Catastrophic costs were incurred by 345 households (39%). Having MDR TB was associated with a higher likelihood of incurring catastrophic costs (54% [95% CI = 43%-61%] versus 38% [95% CI = 34%-41%], p< 0.003). Adverse outcome was independently associated with MDR TB (odds ratio [OR] = 8.4 [95% CI = 4.7-15], p< 0.001), previous TB (OR = 2.1 [95% CI = 1.3-3.5], p = 0.005), days too unwell to work pre-treatment (OR = 1.01 [95% CI = 1.00-1.01], p = 0.02), and catastrophic costs (OR = 1.7 [95% CI = 1.1-2.6], p = 0.01). The adjusted population attributable fraction of adverse outcomes explained by catastrophic costs was 18% (95% CI = 6.9%-28%), similar to that of MDR TB (20% [95% CI = 14%-25%]). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that existing catastrophic costs thresholds (>= 10% or >= 15% of household annual income) were not associated with adverse outcome in our setting. Study limitations included not measuring certain ""dis-saving'' variables (including selling household items) and gathering only 6 mo of costs-specific follow-up data for MDR TB patients. Conclusions: Despite free TB care, having TB disease was expensive for impoverished TB patients in Peru. Incurring higher relative costs was associated with adverse TB outcome. The population attributable fraction indicated that catastrophic costs and MDR TB were associated with similar proportions of adverse outcomes. Thus TB is a socioeconomic as well as infectious problem, and TB control interventions should address both the economic and clinical aspects of this disease."

10.1016_j.ejmech.2014.05.007	Antimycobacterial activity of chiral aminoalcohols with camphane scaffold	A series of aminoalcohols were synthesized by reaction of aminolysis of camphor derived oxiranes with chosen amines. The compounds were evaluated for their in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Ten of the new structures show much higher activity than the classical anti-TB drug ethambutol. Some of the most active compounds were tested against MDR strain 43, and four of them demonstrated excellent activities with MICs 0.27-0.72 mu M. The cytotoxicity of representative exerting antimycobacterial activity compounds was assessed. Quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) model is derived to estimate the contribution of each structural fragment to the activity. The camphane-based aminoalcohols are promising lead compounds for further development of novel antimycobacterial agents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

10.1016_j.ejmech.2014.05.005	Synthesis of novel 1,2,3-triazole derivatives of isoniazid and their in vitro and in vivo antimycobacterial activity evaluation	We report herein the synthesis and antimycobacterial activity of 1,2,3-triazole derivatives of isoniazid. Most of the compounds exhibited potent activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strain with MIC99 values ranging from 0.195 to 1.56 mu M in vitro. One compound showed better in vitro activity than the reference, whereas five compounds were equally potent to the reference compound isoniazid. The cytotoxicity of these compounds was studied against THP-1 cell line and no toxicity was observed even at 50 mu M concentration. The compound with most potent in vitro activity was evaluated for in vivo in murine model of tuberculosis and significantly reduced bacillary load in both lungs and spleen at 10 weeks post-treatment. However this clearance effect was more pronounced in the case of spleen. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations have been performed using two targets 2IDZ 1 (wild type Enoyl-acyl-carrier-protein reductase) and 4DQU 2 (mutant type Enoyl-acyl-carrier-protein reductase) to study the binding orientation and stability of the compound 47. Docking studies proved compound 47 fit well into the binding pocket of both the targets. Molecular dynamic simulations concluded that the highest active compound 47 in complex with 4DQU was more stable when compared to the 2IDZ. We believe that further optimization of these molecules may lead to potent anti-tubercular agents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

10.1186_1471_2180_14_165	Molecular characterization of amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin resistance in M/XDR-TB strains isolated in Thailand	Background: The emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) makes the treatment and control of tuberculosis difficult. Rapid detection of drug-resistant strains is important for the successful treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis; however, not all resistance mechanisms to the injectable second-line drugs such as amikacin (AK), kanamycin (KM), and capreomycin (CAP) are well understood. This study aims to validate the mechanisms associated with AK, KM, and CAP resistance in M. tuberculosis clinical strains isolated in Thailand. Results: A total of 15,124 M. tuberculosis clinical strains were isolated from 23,693 smear-positive sputum samples sent from 288 hospitals in 46 of 77 provinces of Thailand. Phenotypic analysis identified 1,294 strains as MDR-TB and second-line drugs susceptibility was performed in all MDR-TB strains and revealed 58 XDR-TB strains. Twenty-nine KM-resistant strains (26 XDR-TB and 3 MDR-TB) could be retrieved and their genes associated with AK, KM, and CAP resistance were investigated compared with 27 KM-susceptible strains. Mutation of the rrs (A1401G) was found in 21 out of 29 KM-resistant strains whereas mutations of eis either at C-14 T or at G-37 T were found in 5 strains. Three remaining KM-resistant strains did not contain any known mutations. Capreomycin resistance was determined in 28 of 29 KM-resistant strains. Analysis of tlyA revealed that the A33G mutation was found in all CAP-resistant strains and also in susceptible strains. In contrast, the recently identified tlyA mutation T539G and the novel Ins49GC were found in two and one CAP-resistant strains, respectively. In addition, our finding demonstrated the insertion of cytosine at position 581 of the tap, a putative drug efflux encoding gene, in both KM-resistant and KM-susceptible strains. Conclusions: Our finding demonstrated that the majority of KM resistance mechanism in Thai M. tuberculosis clinical strains was rrs mutation at A1401G. Mutations of the eis promoter region either at C-14 T or G-37 T was found in 5 of 29 strains whereas three strains did not contain any known mutations. For CAP resistance, 3 of 28 CAP-resistant strains contained either T539G or Ins49GC mutations at tlyA that might be associated with the resistant phenotype.

10.1371_journal.pone.0099810	Molecular Approaches for Detection of the Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Bangladesh	The principal obstacles in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) are delayed and inaccurate diagnosis which often leads to the onset of the drug resistant TB cases. To avail the appropriate treatment of the patients and to hinder the transmission of drug-resistant TB, accurate and rapid detection of resistant isolates is critical. Present study was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of molecular techniques inclusive of line probe assay (LPA) and GeneXpert MTB/RIF methods for the detection of multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB. Sputum samples from 300 different categories of treated and new TB cases were tested for the detection of possible mutation in the resistance specific genes (rpoB, inhA and katG) through Genotype MTBDRplus assay or LPA and GeneXpert MTB/RIF tests. Culture based conventional drug susceptibility test (DST) was also carried out to measure the efficacy of the molecular methods employed. Among 300 samples, 191 (63.7%) and 193 (64.3%) cases were found to be resistant against rifampicin in LPA and GeneXpert methods, respectively; while 189 (63%) cases of rifampicin resistance were detected by conventional DST methods. On the other hand, 196 (65.3%) and 191 (63.7%) isolates showed isoniazid resistance as detected by LPA and conventional drug susceptibility test (DST), respectively. Among the drug resistant isolates (collectively 198 in LPA and 193 in conventional DST), 189 (95.6%) and 187 (96.9%) were considered to be MDR as examined by LPA and conventional DST, respectively. Category-II and -IV patients encountered higher frequency of drug resistance compared to those from category-I and new cases. Considering the higher sensitivity, specificity and accuracy along with the required time to results significantly shorter, our study supports the adoption of LPA and GeneXpert assay as efficient tools in detecting drug resistant TB in Bangladesh.

10.7554_eLife.02565	A User-Friendly, Open-Source Tool to Project Impact and Cost of Diagnostic Tests for Tuberculosis	Background: Most existing models of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis (TB), do not allow end-users to customize results to local conditions. Methods: We created a dynamic transmission model to project TB incidence, TB mortality, multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB prevalence, and incremental costs over five years after scale-up of nine alternative diagnostic strategies including combinations of sputum smear microscopy, Xpert MTB/RIF, microcolony-based culture, and same-day diagnosis. We developed a corresponding web-based interface that allows users to specify local costs and epidemiology. Full model code -including the ability to change any input parameter -is also included. Results: The impact of improved diagnostic testing was greater for mortality and MDR-TB prevalence than TB incidence, and was maximized in high-incidence, low-HIV settings. More costly interventions generally had greater impact. In settings with little capacity for up-front investment, same-day microscopy had greatest impact on TB incidence and became cost-saving within five years if feasible to deliver at $ 10/test. In settings where more initial investment was possible, population-level scale-up of either Xpert MTB/RIF or microcolony-based culture offered substantially greater benefits, often averting ten times more TB cases than narrowly-targeted diagnostic strategies at minimal incremental long-term cost. Where containing MDR-TB is the overriding concern, Xpert for smear-positives has reasonable impact on MDR-TB incidence, but at substantial price and little impact on overall TB incidence and mortality. Conclusions: This novel, user-friendly modeling framework improves decision-makers' ability to evaluate the impact of TB diagnostic strategies, accounting for local conditions.

pub-0792	A study of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotypic diversity & drug resistance mutations in Varanasi, north India	Background & objectives: One-fifth of the world's new tuberculosis (TB) cases and two-thirds of cases in the South East Asian region occur in India. Molecular typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates has greatly facilitated to understand the transmission of TB. This study was aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology of M. tuberculosis genotypes in Varanasi, north India, and their association with clinical presentation among patients with pulmonary TB. Methods: M. tuberculosis isolates from 104 TB patients attending a tertiary referral hospital of north India were screened for susceptibility to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB) and streptomycin (STR) by proportion method and multiplex-allele-specific-polymerase chain reaction (MAS-PCR). These were genotyped by spoligotyping. The spoligotype patterns were compared with those in the international SITVIT2 spoligotyping database. Results: Eighty three of 104 isolates were distributed in 38 SITs, of which SIT3366 was newly created within the present study. The mass of ongoing transmission with MDR-TB isolates in Varanasi, northern India, was linked to Beijing genotype followed by the CAS1_Delhi lineage. HIV-seropositive patients had a significantly higher proportion of clustered isolates than HIV-seronegative patients and compared with the wild type(wt) isolates, the isolates with katG315Thr mutation were considerably more likely to be clustered. Interpretation & conclusions: This study gives an insight into the M. tuberculosis genetic biodiversity in Varanasi, north India, the predominant spoligotypes and their impact on disease transmission. In this region of north India, TB is caused by a wide diversity of spoligotypes with predominance of four genotype lineages: Beijing, CAS, EAI and T. The Beijing genotype was the most frequent single spoligotype and strongly associated with multi drug resistant (MDR)-TB isolates. These findings may have important implications for control and prevention of TB in north India.

10.1093_bmb_ldu011	Novel diagnostics and therapeutics for drug-resistant tuberculosis	Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. This is at least partly due to late diagnosis and ineffective treatment of drug-resistant status. Selective search of the literature on DR-TB supplemented by recent guidelines from the World Health Organization. Better and more rapid diagnosis of DR-TB by new techniques such as Xpert Mtb/RIF are likely to make a substantial impact on the disease. New therapeutics for DR-TB are entering, or about to enter the market for the first time in decades. It is not clear whether new treatments should be restricted for DR-TB or also used for drug-susceptible tuberculosis. With several new agents on the horizon, there is the real possibility of an entirely new regimen for tuberculosis. An inexpensive 'near-patient' diagnostic test is still needed. Optimizing new drug combination regimens in a timely manner is urgently required.

10.1128_JCM.00417_14	Concordance between Molecular and Phenotypic Testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex Isolates for Resistance to Rifampin and Isoniazid in the United States	Multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) are defined by resistance to at least rifampin (RMP) and isoniazid (INH). Rapid and accurate detection of multidrug resistance is essential for effective treatment and interruption of disease transmission of tuberculosis (TB). Overdiagnosis of MDR TB may result in treatment with second-line drugs that are more costly, less effective, and more poorly tolerated than first-line drugs. CDC offers rapid confirmation of MDR TB by the molecular detection of drug resistance (MDDR) for mutations associated with resistance to RMP and INH along with analysis for resistance to other first-line and second-line drugs. Simultaneously, CDC does growth-based phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) by the indirect agar proportion method for a panel of first-line and second-line antituberculosis drugs. We reviewed discordance between molecular and phenotypic DST for INH and RMP for 285 isolates submitted as MTBC to CDC from September 2009 to February 2011. We compared CDC's results with those from the submitting public health laboratories (PHL). Concordances between molecular and phenotypic testing at CDC were 97.4% for RMP and 92.5% for INH resistance. Concordances between CDC's molecular testing and PHL DST results were 93.9% for RMP and 90.0% for INH. Overall concordance between CDC molecular and PHL DST results was 91.7% for RMP and INH collectively. Discordance was primarily attributable to the absence of known INH resistance mutations in isolates found to be INH resistant by DST and detection of mutations associated with low-level RMP resistance in isolates that were RMP susceptible by phenotypic DST. Both molecular and phenotypic test results should be considered for the diagnosis of MDR TB.		STRAINS
10.1016_j.ijid.2014.01.001	Weight variation over time and its relevance among multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients	Objectives: We aimed to assess the variation in patient body weight over time according to the treatment outcome among multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. The data of patients commencing MDR-TB therapy were analyzed. Data were collected from different public TB treatment facilities located in peri-urban areas to the south of Lima, Peru. The outcome was patient body weight (kilograms) from treatment commencement, measured monthly. A random effects model was fitted using robust standard errors to calculate 95% confidence intervals. Results: Of a total of 1242 TB cases, 243 (19.6%) were MDR-TB. Only 201 cases were included in the analysis; 127 (63.2%) were males and the mean patient age was 33.6 (standard deviation 16.2) years. Weight changes over time among the patients who were cured differed from changes in those who died during therapy (p < 0.001). Weight curve divergence was important at the end of the third, fourth, and fifth treatment months: on average, the weight difference was 2.18 kg (p < 0.001), 3.27 kg (p = 0.007), and 3.58 kg (p = 0.03), respectively, when cured patients were compared to those who died. Conclusions: Our results show that weight variation during treatment can be a useful surrogate for the treatment outcome, specifically death during therapy. MDR-TB patients with weight loss should be followed more closely, as they are at greater risk of death. (C) 2014 The Authors.

10.5588_ijtld.13.0776	Cost-effectiveness of rapid susceptibility testing against second-line drugs for tuberculosis	BACKGROUND: Drug susceptibility testing (DST) against second-line tuberculosis drugs (SLDs) is essential for improving outcomes among multidrug-resistant (MDR-) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) cases. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of rapid DST for SLDs. DESIGN: We constructed a decision analysis model of Xpert (R) MTB/RIF-based TB diagnosis in East and South-East Asia to compare culture-based DST vs. a hypothetical rapid SLD DST system for specimens resistant to rifampin. Our primary outcomes were the effectiveness and incremental cost-effectiveness of a rapid SLD DST assay relative to culture-based DST. RESULTS: For rapid SLD DST to be more effective than culture-based DST, treating individuals with pre-XDR/XDR-TB with a standardized MDR-TB regimen while awaiting culture-based DST must incur at least 30% excess XDR-TB mortality (100%=treatment with first-line drugs); rapid SLD DST should attain an aggregate sensitivity and specificity for all pre-XDR/XDR mutations of 88% and 96%, respectively. The unit cost of the rapid SLD DST assay must approach that of culture to achieve common thresholds for cost-effectiveness in low-income countries. CONCLUSION: Rapid SLD DST has the potential to be cost-effective, but must meet stringent criteria for accuracy and costs, and requires that standardized second-line treatment for pre-XDR/XDR-TB incur substantial excess mortality before the return of culture results.	tuberculosis; economic models; drug resistance; diagnostic methods and procedures	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; METAANALYSIS; DIAGNOSIS; BURDEN; HEALTH
10.5588_ijtld.13.0516	Survey of tuberculosis drug resistance among Tibetan refugees in India	SETTING: Tuberculosis (TB) is a major health problem among Tibetans living in exile in India. Although drug-resistant TB is considered common in clinical practice, precise data are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of drug-resistant cases among new and previously treated Tibetan TB patients. DESIGN: In a drug resistance survey in five Tibetan settlements in India, culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) for first-line drugs were performed among all consecutive new and previously treated TB cases from April 2010 to September 2011. DST against kanamycin (KM), ethionamide, para-aminosalicylic acid and ofloxacin (OFX) was performed on multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) isolates. RESULTS: Of 307 patients enrolled in the study, 264 (193 new and 71 previously treated) were culture-positive and had DST available. All patients tested for the human immunodeficiency virus (n = 250) were negative. Among new TB cases, 14.5% had MDR-TB and 5.7% were isoniazid (lNH) monoresistant. Among previously treated cases, 31.4% had MDR-TB and 12.7% were INH-monoresistant. Of the MDR-TB isolates, 28.6% of new and 26.1% of previously treated cases were OFX-resistant, while 7.1% of new cases and 8.7% of previously treated cases were KM-resistant. Three patients had extensively drug-resistant TB. CONCLUSIONS: MDR-TB is common in new and previously treated Tibetans in India, who also show additional complex resistance patterns. Of particular concern is the high percentage of MDR-TB strains resistant to OFX, KM or both.

10.5588_ijtld.13.0342	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the United Kingdom and Lithuania	Rates of resistance to first- and second-line drugs in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases in the United Kingdom were studied during 2010-2012. The highest rates for ethambutol, pyrazinamide and aminoglycosides occurred among patients originating in Eastern Europe, of whom 47% were Lithuanian. Rates of resistance to kanamycin were significantly lower (P <0.0001) in the Lithuanian National TB Register than among Lithuanian patients resident in the United Kingdom (5% vs. 78%). In 2010, the majority of UK patients of Eastern European origin were located within the London region, whereas in 2011 the majority were located outside this region, a significant change (P = 0.01).

10.1007_s40265_014_0222_8	Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in the Treatment of Tuberculosis: An Update	Tuberculosis (TB) is the world's second leading infectious killer. Cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extremely drug-resistant (XDR-TB) have increased globally. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) remains a standard clinical technique for using plasma drug concentrations to determine dose. For TB patients, TDM provides objective information for the clinician to make informed dosing decisions. Some patients are slow to respond to treatment, and TDM can shorten the time to response and to treatment completion. Normal plasma concentration ranges for the TB drugs have been defined. For practical reasons, only one or two samples are collected post-dose. A 2-h post-dose sample approximates the peak serum drug concentration (C-max) for most TB drugs. Adding a 6-h sample allows the clinician to distinguish between delayed absorption and malabsorption. TDM requires that samples are promptly centrifuged, and that the serum is promptly harvested and frozen. Isoniazid and ethionamide, in particular, are not stable in human serum at room temperature. Rifampicin is stable for more than 6 h under these conditions. Since our 2002 review, several papers regarding TB drug pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and TDM have been published. Thus, we have better information regarding the concentrations required for effective TB therapy. In vitro and animal model data clearly show concentration responses for most TB drugs. Recent studies emphasize the importance of rifamycins and pyrazinamide as sterilizing agents. A strong argument can be made for maximizing patient exposure to these drugs, short of toxicity. Further, the very concept behind 'minimal inhibitory concentration' (MIC) implies that one should achieve concentrations above the minimum in order to maximize response. Some, but not all clinical data are consistent with the utility of this approach. The low ends of the TB drug normal ranges set reasonable 'floors' above which plasma concentrations should be maintained. Patients with diabetes and those infected with HIV have a particular risk for poor drug absorption, and for drug-drug interactions. Published guidelines typically describe interactions between two drugs, whereas the clinical situation often is considerably more complex. Under 'real-life' circumstances, TDM often is the best available tool for sorting out these multi-drug interactions, and for providing the patient safe and adequate doses. Plasma concentrations cannot explain all of the variability in patient responses to TB treatment, and cannot guarantee patient outcomes. However, combined with clinical and bacteriological data, TDM can be a decisive tool, allowing clinicians to successfully treat even the most complicated TB patients.

10.1007_s11684_014_0321_7	Ventricular tachycardia in a disseminated MDR-TB patient: a case report and brief review of literature	Although significant breakthroughs have been achieved in tuberculosis management, we still encounter numerous difficulties in diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Additionally, a new challenge, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) with unspecific clinical presentation, often results in delayed diagnosis. In this paper, we reported a case of disseminated tuberculosis with rare presentation of ventricular fibrillation, which proved resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin. A review of literature showed that ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia in tuberculosis patients with pericarditis or myocarditis has been sporadically reported in the past, but none has been conducted involving patients with MDR-TB infections.	tuberculosis; MDR-TB; ventricular tachycardia	
10.1371_journal.pone.0097837	Mycobacterium tuberculosis Multidrug Resistant Strain M Induces an Altered Activation of Cytotoxic CD8(+) T Cells	In human tuberculosis (TB), CD8(+) T cells contribute to host defense by the release of Th1 cytokines and the direct killing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-infected macrophages via granule exocytosis pathway or the engagement of receptors on target cells. Previously we demonstrated that strain M, the most prevalent multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mtb strain in Argentine, is a weak inducer of IFN-gamma and elicits a remarkably low CD8-dependent cytotoxic T cell activity (CTL). In contrast, the closely related strain 410, which caused a unique case of MDR-TB, elicits a CTL response similar to H37Rv. In this work we extend our previous study investigating some parameters that can account for this discrepancy. We evaluated the expressions of the lytic molecules perforin, granzyme B and granulysin and the chemokine CCL5 in CD8(+) T cells as well as activation markers CD69 and CD25 and IL-2 expression in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells stimulated with strains H37Rv, M and 410. Our results demonstrate that M-stimulated CD8(+) T cells from purified protein derivative positive healthy donors show low intracellular expression of perforin, granzyme B, granulysin and CCL5 together with an impaired ability to form conjugates with autologous M-pulsed macrophages. Besides, M induces low CD69 and IL-2 expression in CD4+ and CD8(+) T cells, being CD69 and IL-2 expression closely associated. Furthermore, IL-2 addition enhanced perforin and granulysin expression as well as the degranulation marker CD107 in M-stimulated CD8(+) T cells, making no differences with cells stimulated with strains H37Rv or 410. Thus, our results highlight the role of IL-2 in M-induced CTL activity that drives the proper activation of CD8(+) T cells as well as CD4(+) T cells collaboration.

10.1590_0074_0276130469	In house reverse membrane hybridisation assay versus GenoType MTBDRplus and their performance to detect mutations in the genes rpoB, katG and inhA	Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) threatens global TB control and is a major public health concern in several countries. We therefore developed a multiplex assay (LINE-TB/MDR) that is able to identify the most frequent mutations related to rifampicin (RMP) and isoniazid (INH) resistance. The assay is based on multiplex polymerase chain reaction, membrane hybridisation and colorimetric detection targeting of rpoB and katG genes, as well as the inhA promoter, which are all known to carry specific mutations associated with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). The assay was validated on a reference panel of 108 M. tuberculosis isolates that were characterised by the proportion method and by DNA sequencing of the targets. When comparing the performance of LINE-TB/MDR with DNA sequencing, the sensitivity, specificity and agreement were 100%, 100% and 100%, respectively, for RMP and 77.6%, 90.6% and 88.9%, respectively, for INH. Using drug sensibility testing as a reference standard, the performance of LINE-TB/MDR regarding sensitivity, specificity and agreement was 100%, 100% and 100% (95%), respectively, for RMP and 77%, 100% and 88.7% (82.2-95.1), respectively, for INH. LINE-TB/MDR was compared with GenoType MTBDRplus for 65 isolates, resulting in an agreement of 93.6% (86.7-97.5) for RIF and 87.4% (84.3-96.2) for INH. LINE-TB/MDR warrants further clinical validation and may be an affordable alternative for MDR-TB diagnosis.

10.1111_1469_0691.12335	Salvage therapy for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), defined as Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin, is challenging under the best of circumstances, and particularly in resource-limited settings. For patients who remain persistently sputum-culture-positive despite therapy with second-line TB drugs, treatment options are limited, especially if disease is too advanced for resective surgery. Salvage therapy refers to the design of a regimen combining new and previously used drugs in a final effort to attain sputum conversion before declaring treatment to have failed. We retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of salvage therapy in 213 Peruvian patients. Salvage regimens included a median of two new drugs (range 1-6) and nine (range 5-13) total (new plus previously used) drugs. The most frequently used new drug was moxifloxacin, followed by capreomycin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, kanamycin and clarithromycin. Culture conversion occurred in 65 (30.5%) patients. Salvage regimens that included moxifloxacin were significantly more likely to be followed by culture conversion (OR 2.2; p 0.02). Later-generation fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin should be used in salvage therapy but also in the initial treatment of MDR-TB, if the best clinical strategy is to use the most effective drugs when the patient has the best chance for cure. New TB drugs are most likely to be initially used in salvage patients, in conditions similar to those described here. Close bacteriological monitoring of these patients will be essential, as useful information about the best way to use these new drugs can be gained from analysis of salvage therapy cohorts.

10.3892_mmr.2014.2045	Analysis of mutational characteristics of the drug-resistant gene katG in multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis L-form among patients with pneumoconiosis complicated with tuberculosis	The aim of the present study was to investigate the mutational characteristics of drug-resistant genetic mutations in the katG gene to isoniazid (INH) in multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) L-form among patients with pneumoconiosis complicated with tuberculosis (TB), in order to reduce the occurrence of drug resistance in patients, and gain further insight into the mechanisms underlying drug resistance in MDR-TB L-form. A total of 114 clinically isolated strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-forms were collected. The MDR-TB L-forms were identified using a conventional antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST). The DNA genomes were extracted, the target genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction technology and the hotspot mutational regions in the katG gene were analyzed by direct sequencing. The results of AST analysis demonstrated that there were 31 strains of MDR-TB L-forms in 114 clinical isolates. The mutation rate of katG was 61.29% (19/31) in INH-resistant isolates, mainly concentrated in codon 315 (Ser315Thr, 48.39% and Ser315Asn, 9.68%) and 431 (Ala431Val, 3.23%). Base substitutions were identified, however, no multisite mutations were found. No mutations in katG were identified in 10 INH-sensitive strains that were randomly selected. INH-resistance was more severe in MDR-TB L-form isolates among patients with pneumoconiosis complicated with TB. The substitution of highly conserved amino acids encoded by the katG gene resulted in the molecular mechanisms responsible for INH resistance in MDR-TB L-form isolates. It was also verified that the katG gene was in diversiform. The katG Ser315Thr mutation is one of the main causes of resistance to INH in MDR-TB L-form isolates.	pneumoconiosis; tuberculosis; multi-drug resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis L-form; drug resistance; katG; sequence analysis	
10.5588_ijtld.13.0191	Primary drug resistance among pulmonary treatment-naive tuberculosis patients in Amazonas State, Brazil	BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is the main indicator of previous treatment in tuberculosis (TB) patients. MDR-TB among treatment-naive patients indicates infection with drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, and such cases are considered primary drug-resistant cases. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of drug resistance in pulmonary TB (PTB) treatment-nave patients and to identify the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the resistant population. METHODS: A total of 205 treatment-naive PTB patients from Manaus, Amazonas State, Brazil, were enrolled. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed on all positive mycobacterial cultures using the 1% proportion method. RESULTS: Positive M. tuberculosis cultures were obtained from only 175 patients for DST. The prevalence of primary MDR-TB was 1.7% (3/175); 14.3% (25/175) of the cultures presented resistance to at least one of the drugs. Resistance to streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol was respectively 8.6%, 6.9%, 3.4% and 2.3%. An association between TB patients with resistance to more than one drug and known previous household contact with a TB patient was observed (P= 0.008, OR 6.7, 95%CI 1.2-67.3). CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of primary MDR-TB currently is relatively low, it may become a major public health problem if tailored treatment is not provided, as resistance to more than one drug is significantly associated with household contact.	drug susceptibility testing; rifampicin; isoniazid	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; RISK-FACTORS; RETREATMENT
10.5588_ijtld.13.0602	Body mass index predictive of sputum culture conversion among MDR-TB patients in Indonesia	SETTING: Programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis at Persahabatan Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between body mass index (BMI) and sputum culture conversion during treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 212 MDR-TB patients. MDR-TB was confirmed using culture in liquid medium and line-probe assay. Patients were treated with a standardised regimen unless they were resistant to any of the drugs tested. Study outcomes were time to culture conversion (primary) and probability of conversion within 4 months (secondary). Data were analysed using Kaplan-Meier curves, discrete time-survival analysis and Poisson regression. RESULTS: Compared to patients with normal weight (BMI >= 18.5 kg/m(2)), severely underweight patients (BMI <16 kg/m(2)) had longer time to initial conversion (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.55, 95%CI 0.37-0.84) and a lower probability of sputum culture conversion within 4 months (adjusted relative risk 0.67, 95%CI 0.54-0.83). Other predictors for longer sputum culture conversion were female sex (aHR 0.55, 95%CI 0.39-0.78), resistance to injectables (aHR 0.59, 95%CI 0.42-0.83) and high baseline smear grade (aHR 0.33, 95%CI 0.18-0.60). CONCLUSION: Severe underweight was associated with longer time to initial sputum culture conversion among MDR-TB patients.	programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis; severe underweight; hospital	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; RISK-FACTORS; MORTALITY; MALNUTRITION; IMPACT; SMEAR
10.5588_ijtld.13.0268	Serum concentrations of cycloserine and outcome of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Northern Taiwan	BACKGROUND: Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has been advocated to promote the efficacy of anti-tuberculosis agents. Cycloserine (CS) is a second-line anti-tuberculosis drug whose serum concentrations in tuberculosis (TB) patients are largely unknown. OBJECTIVES: To investigate serum CS concentrations after drug ingestion in TB patients. METHODS: Multidrug-resistant 113 patients who were taking CS in a tertiary care centre in northern Taiwan between 1 April 2009 and 31 October 2009 were enrolled in the study. Serum CS concentrations were measured at 2 and 6 h after drug administration. RESULTS: Of 32 patients enrolled, 23 were males and 9 females. The mean CS dose was 8.8 +/- 1.3 mg/kg. The mean serum concentrations at 2 and 6 h were respectively 19.7 +/- 8.3 and 18.1 +/- 8.7 mu g/ml. Seven patients (22%) had serum drug concentrations that were higher at 6 h than at 2 h, 12 (38%) had peak serum concentrations within the recommended range of 20-35 mu g/ml; 18 patients (56%) had concentrations <20 mu g/ml at both 2 h and 6 h; and 2 patients (6%) had at least one measurement >35 mu g/ml. CONCLUSION: Lower than recommended serum CS concentrations and delayed absorption were common. It is essential to develop practical TDM to maintain proper serum drug concentrations.	cycloserine; MDR-TB; therapeutic drug monitoring; tuberculosis	HIV-INFECTED PERSONS; FASTING CONDITIONS; POPULATION PHARMACOKINETICS; CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; RIFAMPIN; PYRAZINAMIDE; ETHAMBUTOL; ANTACIDS; FOOD
10.3201_eid2005.131037	Treatment Practices, Outcomes, and Costs of Multidrug-Resistant and Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis, United States, 2005-2007	To describe factors associated with multidrug-resistant (MDR), including extensively-drug-resistant (XDR), tuberculosis (TB) in the United States, we abstracted inpatient, laboratory, and public health clinic records of a sample of MDR TB patients reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from California, New York City, and Texas during 2005-2007. At initial diagnosis, MDR TB was detected in 94% of 130 MDR TB patients and XDR TB in 80% of 5 XDR TB patients. Mutually exclusive resistance was 4% XDR, 17% pre-XDR, 24% total first-line resistance, 43% isoniazid/rifampin/rifabutin-plus-other resistance, and 13% isoniazid/rifampin/rifabutin-only resistance. Nearly three-quarters of patients were hospitalized, 78% completed treatment, and 9% died during treatment. Direct costs, mostly covered by the public sector, averaged $134,000 per MDR TB and $430,000 per XDR TB patient; in comparison, estimated cost per non-MDR TB patient is $17,000. Drug resistance was extensive, care was complex, treatment completion rates were high, and treatment was expensive.		NEW-YORK-CITY; METAANALYSIS; CALIFORNIA
10.1016_j.ijid.2013.12.015	Prevalence and characterization of drug-resistant tuberculosis in a local hospital of Northeast China	Objectives: To investigate the distribution and risk factors associated with drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) at a local hospital in Northeast China. Methods: A total of 205 patients with TB were enrolled in the study from March 8, 2010 to July 13, 2011. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains isolated from patients were subjected to drug susceptibility testing by proportion method. Results: Among the 205 patients with MTB, 54 (26.3%) had isolates that showed resistance to at least one drug. The overall prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was 6.8% (n = 14) (3.0% of newly diagnosed patients and 22.0% of previously treated cases). Importantly, an extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) isolate was found, which was isolated from a newly treated patient. Eleven (5.4%) were infected with a poly-resistant strain of MTB (5.5% of newly diagnosed patients and 4.9% of previously treated cases). The mono-resistance rates of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, streptomycin, ofloxacin, and kanamycin were 3.4%, 1.5%, 2.4%, 3.9%, 2.4%, and 0.5%, respectively. Certain groups, including previously treated patients and male patients, were more likely to develop drug-resistant TB. Conclusions: The results of this analysis of drug resistance in MTB reflect the situation in a local hospital and indicate that the morbidity related to TB, especially MDR-TB, is still a serious health problem. Thus, the timely detection of drug resistance is of great importance to optimize treatment and to direct infection control measures to block the transmission of MDR-TB. (C) 2014 The Authors.

10.1128_IAI.01332_13	An ethA-ethR-Deficient Mycobacterium bovis BCG Mutant Displays Increased Adherence to Mammalian Cells and Greater Persistence In Vivo, Which Correlate with Altered Mycolic Acid Composition	Tuberculosis remains a major worldwide epidemic because of its sole etiological agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Ethionamide (ETH) is one of the major antitubercular drugs used to treat infections with multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains. ETH is a prodrug that requires activation within the mycobacterial cell; its bioactivation involves the ethA-ethR locus, which encodes the monooxygenase EthA, while EthR is a transcriptional regulator that binds to the intergenic promoter region of the ethA-ethR locus. While most studies have focused on the role of EthA-EthR in ETH bioactivation, its physiological role in mycobacteria has remained elusive, although a role in bacterial cell detoxification has been proposed. Moreover, the importance of EthA-EthR in vivo has never been reported on. Here we constructed and characterized an EthA-EthR-deficient mutant of Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Our results indicate that absence of the ethA-ethR locus led to greater persistence of M. bovis BCG in the mouse model of mycobacterial infection, which correlated with greater adherence to mammalian cells. Furthermore, analysis of cell wall lipid composition by thin-layer chromatography and mass spectrometry revealed differences between the ethA-ethR KO mutant and the parental strain in the relative amounts of alpha-and keto-mycolates. Therefore, we propose here that M. bovis BCG ethA-ethR is involved in the cell wall-bound mycolate profile, which impacts mycobacterial adherence properties and in vivo persistence. This study thus provides some experimental clues to the possible physiological role of ethA-ethR and proposes that this locus is a novel factor involved in the modulation of mycobacterial virulence.

10.1136_thoraxjnl_2013_203900	High treatment success in children treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: an observational cohort study	Background Few studies have described the management of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) in children and evidence-based guidance on management is lacking. We describe the presentation, treatment and outcome in children treated for severe and non-severe MDR-TB in Cape Town, South Africa. Methods We conducted an observational cohort study of all children (<15 years) treated for MDR-TB if routinely initiated on treatment between January 2009 and December 2010. Treatment was based on local standard of care, based on international guidelines. Data were collected through family interviews and folder review. Standardised definitions were used for diagnosis, severity of disease, adverse events and outcome. Results Of 149 children started on MDR-TB treatment, the median age was 36 months (IQR 16-66), 32 (22%; of 146 tested) had HIV infection and 59 (40%) had a confirmed diagnosis. Ninety-four (66%) children were treated with an injectable drug and the median total duration of treatment was 13 months (IQR 11-18). Thirty-six (24%) children were cured, 101 (68%) probably cured, 1 (1%) was transferred out, 8 (5%) were lost to follow-up and 3 (2%) died. Children with severe disease were older (54 months (IQR 18-142) vs 31.5 months (IQR 17.5-53.5); p=0.012), more commonly had HIV infection (OR 6.25; 95% CI 2.50 to 15.6; p<0.001) and were more likely to die (p=0.008). Discussion A confirmed diagnosis of MDR-TB is not possible in all cases but this should not impede the treatment of MDR-TB in children. More than 90% of children with MDR-TB can be successfully treated. Non-severe disease could be successfully treated with reduced treatment duration.

10.1007_s00044_013_0815_x	Discovery of new antitubercular agents by combining pyrazoline and benzoxazole pharmacophores: design, synthesis and insights into the binding interactions	The present study is aimed at combining two well-known pharmacophores (pyrazoline and benzoxazole nucleus) to design and synthesize a series of new benzoxazole-based pyrazoline derivatives. In vitro antitubercular evaluation against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) strains showed that most of the target compounds displayed potent activity (MIC similar to 0.625-25 mu g/mL). Few compounds were found to be better than isoniazid against MDR-TB (MIC = 3.25 mu g/mL). In order to gain insights into the plausible binding motifs, the target compounds were docked into enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase, a molecular target of isoniazid. Many compounds were successfully docked into the active site of enoyl-ACP reductase and all the docked compounds occupied the same hydrophobic binding pocket and interacted mostly by dispersion interactions with the neighboring residues Met103, Met155, Tyr158, Met199, Ile202, Ile215, and Leu218. Contribution of the three pharmacophoric fragments (pyrazoline, benzoxazole and aryl ring) towards protein-ligand binding was evaluated at semi-empirical quantum mechanics level. The interaction energies suggested that most of the binding was governed by the benzoxazole moiety followed by pyrazoline and aryl rings.

The primary aim was to estimate the association between DM and rate of TB sputum culture conversion. A secondary objective was to estimate the association between DM and the risk of poor treatment outcomes among patients with MDR-TB. Materials and Methods: A cohort of all adult patients starting MDR-TB treatment in the country of Georgia between 20092011 was followed during second-line TB therapy. Cox proportional models were used to estimate the adjusted hazard rate of sputum culture conversion. Log-binomial regression models were used to estimate the cumulative risk of poor TB treatment outcome. Results: Among 1,366 patients with sputum culture conversion information, 966 (70.7%) had culture conversion and the median time to conversion was 68 days (interquartile range 50-120). The rate of conversion was similar among patients with MDR-TB and DM (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.71-1.28) compared to patients with MDR-TB only. The rate of culture conversion was significantly less in patients that currently smoked (aHR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.95), had low body mass index (aHR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.84), second-line resistance (aHR 0.56, 95% CI 0.43-0.73), lung cavities (aHR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.83) and with disseminated TB (aHR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.90). The cumulative risk of poor treatment outcome was also similar among TB patients with and without DM (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 1.03, 95% CI 0.93-1.14). Conclusions: In adjusted analyses, DM did not impact culture conversion rates in a clinically meaningful way but smoking did.		TREATMENT OUTCOMES; PREDICTORS; ASSOCIATION; IMPACT
10.1371_journal.pone.0094618	Multi Drug Resistant Tuberculosis in Mosango, a Rural Area in the Democratic Republic of Congo	Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a serious threat which jeopardizes the worldwide efforts to control TB. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is one of 27 countries with a high burden of MDR-TB. Data on the magnitude, trends, and the distribution of MDR-TB in DRC are scanty. Kinshasa, the capital city of DRC which accounts for 20% of all TB cases nationwide, is notifying more than 80% of all MDR suspects. We report here a cluster of MDR-TB cases that was investigated in the Mosango health district, in the Bandundu south Province, DRC in 2008. Phenotypic Drug Sensitivity Testing and DNA sequencing were performed on 18 sputum specimens collected from 4 MDR-TB suspects and 5 household contacts. Sequencing data confirmed that the 4 suspects were indeed Rifampicin resistant cases. Sequencing of the rpoB gene showed that 3 cases (patients A, B and D) had a single mutation encoding a substitution to 526Tyr, 531Trp and 526Leu respectively. Patient C had a double mutation encoding a change to 531Leu and 633Leu. Two of the investigated cases died within 4 months of a second-line treatment course. Results highlight the need to enhance adequate laboratory services within the country for both clinical as well as surveillance purposes.

10.1371_journal.pone.0094953	Reduced Virulence of an Extensively Drug-Resistant Outbreak Strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a Murine Model	Bacterial drug resistance is often associated with a fitness cost. Large outbreaks of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB have been described that predominately affect persons with HIV infection. We obtained four closely-related Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains (genotype F15/LAM4/KZN) from an outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, including drug-sensitive, MDR, and XDR clinical isolates. We compared the virulence of these strains in a murine model of aerosol M. tuberculosis infection for four phenotypes: (1) competitive in vivo growth in lung and spleen, (2) non-competitive in vivo growth in lung and spleen, (3) murine survival time, and (4) lung pathology. When mixtures of sensitive, MDR, and XDR KZN strains were aerosolized (competitive model), lung CFUs were similar at 60 days after infection, and spleen CFUs were ordered as follows: sensitive > MDR > XDR. When individual strains were aerosolized (noncompetitive model), modest differences in lung and spleen CFUs were observed with the same ordering. C57BL/6, C3H/FeJ, and SCID mice all survived longer after infection with MDR as compared to sensitive strains. SCID mice infected with an XDR strain survived longer than those infected with MDR or sensitive strains. Lung pathology was reduced after XDR TB infection compared to sensitive or MDR TB infection. In summary, increasing degrees of drug resistance were associated with decreasing murine virulence in this collection of KZN strains as measured by all four virulence phenotypes. The predominance of HIV-infected patients in MDR and XDR TB outbreaks may be explained by decreased virulence of these strains in humans.

10.1186_1471_2334_14_200	Pyrosequencing for rapid detection of Tuberculosis resistance in clinical isolates and Sputum samples from re-treatment Pulmonary Tuberculosis patients	Background: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major public health problem. Early diagnosis of MDR-TB patients is essential for minimizing the risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) transmission. The conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST) methods for detection of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis are laborious and cannot provide the rapid detection for clinical practice. Methods: The aim of this study was to develop a pyrosequencing approach for the simultaneous detection of resistance to rifampin (RIF), isoniazid (INH), ethambutol (EMB), streptomycin (SM), ofloxacin (OFL) and amikacin (AMK) in M. tuberculosis clinical isolates and sputum samples from re-treatment pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients. We identified the optimum conditions for detection mutation of rpoB, katG, rpsl, embB, gyrA and rrs gene by pyrosequencing. Then this approach was applied to detect 205 clinical isolates and 24 sputum samples of M. tuberculosis from re-treatment PTB patients. Results: The mutations of rpoB and gyrA gene were detected by pyrosequencig with the SQA mode, and the mutations of katG, rpsl, embB, gyrA and rrs gene were detected by pyrosequencing with SNP mode. Compared with the Bactec MGIT 960 mycobacterial detection system, the accuracy of pyrosequencing for the detection of RIF, INH, EMB, SM, AMK and OFL resistance in clinical isolates was 95.0%, 79.2%, 70.3%, 84.5%, 96.5% and 91.1%, respectively. In sputum samples the accuracy was 83.3%, 83.3%, 60.9%, 83.3%, 87.5% and 91.7%, respectively. Conclusions: The newly established pyrosequencing assay is a rapid and high-throughput method for the detection of resistance to RIF, INH, SM, EMB, OFL and AMK in M. tuberculosis. Pyrosequencing can be used as a practical molecular diagnostic tool for screening and predicting the resistance of re-treatment pulmonary tuberculosis patients.

10.1371_journal.pone.0090110	Reducing Communication Delays and Improving Quality of Care with a Tuberculosis Laboratory Information System in Resource Poor Environments: A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial	Background: Lost, delayed or incorrect laboratory results are associated with delays in initiating treatment. Delays in treatment for Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) can worsen patient outcomes and increase transmission. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of a laboratory information system in reducing delays and the time for MDR-TB patients to culture convert (stop transmitting). Methods: Setting: 78 primary Health Centers (HCs) in Lima, Peru. Participants lived within the catchment area of participating HCs and had at least one MDR-TB risk factor. The study design was a cluster randomized controlled trial with baseline data. The intervention was the e-Chasqui web-based laboratory information system. Main outcome measures were: times to communicate a result; to start or change a patient's treatment; and for that patient to culture convert. Results: 1671 patients were enrolled. Intervention HCs took significantly less time to receive drug susceptibility test (DST) (median 11 vs. 17 days, Hazard Ratio 0.67 [0.62-0.72]) and culture (5 vs. 8 days, 0.68 [0.65-0.72]) results. The time to treatment was not significantly different, but patients in intervention HCs took 16 days (20%) less time to culture convert (p = 0.047). Conclusions: The eChasqui system reduced the time to communicate results between laboratories and HCs and time to culture conversion. It is now used in over 259 HCs covering 4.1 million people. This is the first randomized controlled trial of a laboratory information system in a developing country for any disease and the only study worldwide to show clinical impact of such a system.

10.1186_1471_2458_14_340	Trend of microbiologically-confirmed tuberculosis in a low-incidence setting with high immigration rates	Background: The metropolitan area of Bologna, a city in Northern Italy (Emilia Romagna region), is considered a low incidence setting for TB, but has a high rate of foreign immigration (13.5% official resident immigrants relative to the whole population in 2011). The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological trend of TB, focusing on differences between Italian and foreign-born cases. Methods: We examined all bacteriologically confirmed TB cases identified in the Microbiology Unit of Bologna University Hospital from January 2008 and December 2011. We compared demographic, clinical and microbiological data for Italian vs. foreign-born TB cases. Results: Out of 255 TB cases identified during the study period, 168 (65.9%) were represented by foreign-born cases. The proportion of immigrants with TB progressively increased over the study period (from 60.8% in 2008 to 67.5% in 2011). Although foreign-born cases were significantly younger than Italian cases (mean age 32.3 +/- 14.4 years vs 61.9 +/- 21.5 years), the mean age among the latter decreased from 71.2 in 2008 to 54.6 years in 2011 (p = 0.036). Concerning TB localization, 65.9% (n = 168) had pulmonary TB (P-TB) and 34.1% (n = 87) extra-pulmonary TB (EP-TB). In this study, 35.6% of Italian-born P-TB cases were smear positive, versus 51.4% of foreign-born P-TB cases. The highest proportion of high-grade positive microscopy P-TB was among subjects between 25-34 years old (36.9%; p = 0.004). Mono-resistance to isoniazid (mono-H) was found among 9.2% and 10.1% of Italian and foreign-born cases, respectively. Among Italian cases, resistance to H and any other first line drug (poly-H) and Multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) were 4.6% and 1.2%, respectively. In foreign-born cases poly-H (12.8%) and MDR-TB (6.9%) significantly increased over the time (p = 0.003 and p = 0.007, respectively). The proportion of MDR-TB was significantly higher among immigrants from Eastern Europe (10.9%) compared to Italian-born patients (p = 0.043). All (n = 9) MTB strains resistant to four or five first line drugs and Extensively drug resistant (XDR-TB) strains were from foreign-born cases. Conclusions: TB epidemiology in a low incidence setting is strongly influenced by immigration rates. Ethnicity, mean age, and incidence of MDR-TB among foreign-born cases reflect immigration trends in Northern Italy.

10.1371_journal.pone.0094393	Intensive-Phase Treatment Outcomes among Hospitalized Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients: Results from a Nationwide Cohort in Nigeria	Background: Nigeria is faced with a high burden of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Treatment outcomes among MDR-TB patients registered across the globe have been poor, partly due to high loss-to-follow-up. To address this challenge, MDR-TB patients in Nigeria are hospitalized during the intensive-phase(IP) of treatment (first 6-8 months) and are provided with a package of care including standardized MDR-TB treatment regimen, antiretroviral therapy (ART) and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (CPT) for HIV-infected patients, nutritional and psychosocial support. In this study, we report the end-IP treatment outcomes among them. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed the patient records of all bacteriologically-confirmed MDR-TB patients admitted for treatment between July 2010 and October 2012. Results: Of 162 patients, 105(65%) were male, median age was 34 years and 28(17%) were HIV-infected; all 28 received ART and CPT. Overall, 138(85%) were alive and culture negative at the end of IP, 24(15%) died and there was no loss-to-follow-up. Mortality was related to low CD4-counts at baseline among HIV-positive patients. The median increase in body mass index among those documented to be underweight was 2.6 kg/m(2) (p<0.01) and CD4-counts improved by a median of 52 cells/microL among the HIV-infected patients (p<0.01). Conclusions: End-IP treatment outcomes were exceptional compared to previously published data from international cohorts, thus confirming the usefulness of a hospitalized model of care. However, less than five percent of all estimated 3600 MDR-TB patients in Nigeria were initiated on treatment during the study period. Given the expected scale-up of MDR-TB care, the hospitalized model is challenging to sustain and the national TB programme is contemplating to move to ambulatory care. Hence, we recommend using both ambulatory and hospitalized approaches, with the latter being reserved for selected high-risk groups.

10.1371_journal.pone.0094016	Association between Health Systems Performance and Treatment Outcomes in Patients Co-Infected with MDR-TB and HIV in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: Implications for TB Programmes	Objective: To improve the treatment of MDR-TB and HIV co-infected patients, we investigated the relationship between health system performance and patient treatment outcomes at 4 decentralised MDR-TB sites. Methods: In this mixed methods case study which included prospective comparative data, we measured health system performance using a framework of domains comprising key health service components. Using Pearson Product Moment Correlation coefficients we quantified the direction and magnitude of the association between health system performance and MDR-TB treatment outcomes. Qualitative data from participant observation and interviews analysed using systematic text condensation (STC) complemented our quantitative findings. Findings: We found significant differences in treatment outcomes across the sites with successful outcomes varying from 72% at Site 1 to 52% at Site 4 (p<0.01). Health systems performance scores also varied considerably across the sites. Our findings suggest there is a correlation between treatment outcomes and overall health system performance which is significant (r = 0.99, p<0.01), with Site 1 having the highest number of successful treatment outcomes and the highest health system performance. Although the 'integration' domain, which measured integration of MDR-TB services into existing services appeared to have the strongest association with successful treatment outcomes (r = 0.99, p<0.01), qualitative data indicated that the 'context' domain influenced the other domains. Conclusion: We suggest that there is an association between treatment outcomes and health system performance. The chance of treatment success is greater if decentralised MDR-TB services are integrated into existing services. To optimise successful treatment outcomes, regular monitoring and support are needed at a district, facility and individual level to ensure the local context is supportive of new programmes and implementation is according to guidelines.

10.5694_mja13.11342	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Western Australia, 1998-2012	Objective: To describe the epidemiology, clinical features, health care resource use, treatment and outcomes of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases diagnosed in Western Australia, compared with matched controls with drug-susceptible TB. Design, setting and patients: Retrospective case control study of all MDR-TB cases notified in WA between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2012, compared with matched controls. Cases were identified and managed through the Western Australia Tuberculosis Control Program, including specialist TB services, the Mycobacterium Reference Laboratory and affiliated secondary and tertiary outpatient and inpatient medical services in WA. Main outcome measures: Demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, treatment, outcomes and health care resource use. Results: Sixteen MDR-TB cases were notified during the study period (1.2% of all TB notifications). The median age of patients with MDR-TB was 26 years, and 15 were born outside Australia. Patients with MDR-TB were more likely to have received previous treatment (25% v 2%; P = 0.006) and had longer delays to effective therapy (median, 48 v 21 days; P = 0.002) than controls. MDR-TB patients more frequently required hospitalisation (100% v 35%; P < 0.001) and were treated for longer (mean, 597 v 229 days). Adverse effects were more commonly reported in MDR-TB patients than controls (81% v 33%; P < 0.001). Treatment success was not significantly different between patients with MDR-TB and controls (75% v 84%; P = 0.72). No treatment failures or deaths were identified in either group. Conclusion: MDR-TB remains uncommon in WA but its challenges are increasingly recognised. Despite delays in commencing effective therapy. MDR-TB is usually associated with treatment success. Adverse effects of medications are common, and treatment courses are tong and complex. Specialist TB services should continue to be involved in management and prevention of all cases of MDR-TB.

10.1371_journal.pone.0093206	Predictors of Two Months Culture Conversion in Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis: Findings from a Retrospective Cohort Study	Background: Various studies have reported culture conversion at two months as a predictor of successful treatment outcome in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Objectives: The present study was conducted with the aim to evaluate the rate and predictors of culture conversion at two months in MDR-TB patients. Methods: All confirmed pulmonary MDR-TB patients enrolled for treatment at Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar, Pakistan from 1 January to 31 December 2012 and met the inclusion criteria were reviewed retrospectively. Rate and predictors of culture conversion at two months were evaluated. Results: Eighty seven (53.4%) out of 163 patients achieved culture conversion at two months. In a multivariate analysis lung cavitation at baseline chest X-ray (P = 0.006, OR = 0.349), resistance to ofloxacin (P = 0.041, OR = 0.193) and streptomycin (P = 0.017, OR = 0.295) had statistically significant (P<0.05) negative association with culture conversion at two months. Conclusion: A reasonable proportion of patients achieved culture conversion at two months. Factors negatively associated with culture conversion at two months can be easily identified either before diagnosis or early in the course of MDR-TB treatment. This may help in better care of individual patients by identifying them early and treating them vigorously.

10.3791_51256	Demonstrating a Multi-drug Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Amplification Microarray	Simplifying microarray workflow is a necessary first step for creating MDR-TB microarray-based diagnostics that can be routinely used in lower-resource environments. An amplification microarray combines asymmetric PCR amplification, target size selection, target labeling, and microarray hybridization within a single solution and into a single microfluidic chamber. A batch processing method is demonstrated with a 9-plex asymmetric master mix and low-density gel element microarray for genotyping multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDRTB). The protocol described here can be completed in 6 hr and provide correct genotyping with at least 1,000 cell equivalents of genomic DNA. Incorporating on-chip wash steps is feasible, which will result in an entirely closed amplicon method and system. The extent of multiplexing with an amplification microarray is ultimately constrained by the number of primer pairs that can be combined into a single master mix and still achieve desired sensitivity and specificity performance metrics, rather than the number of probes that are immobilized on the array. Likewise, the total analysis time can be shortened or lengthened depending on the specific intended use, research question, and desired limits of detection. Nevertheless, the general approach significantly streamlines microarray workflow for the end user by reducing the number of manually intensive and time-consuming processing steps, and provides a simplified biochemical and microfluidic path for translating microarray-based diagnostics into routine clinical practice.

10.7705_biomedica.v34i0.1694	The usefulness of the nitrate reductase assay for detecting drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Introduction: The early detection of resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is of primary importance for both patient management and infection control. Objective: To evaluate nitrate reductase assay (NRA) performance for the testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug-resistance against first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs, such as rifampicin (RIF), isoniazid (INH), streptomycin (STR) and ethambutol (EMB). Materials and methods: Fifty isolates were tested by using both the proportion method and the nitrate reductase assay. Results: RIF, INH, STR and EMB sensitivity was found to be 92%, 91%, 63% and 80% and 100%, respectively, and a corresponding specificity of 100%, 100%, 100% and 98% by comparing NRA results to those obtained with the gold standard (i.e., the proportion method). The positive predictive values for RIF, INH, STR and EMB were 100%, 100%, 100% and 80% and the negative predictive values were 97%, 93%, 73% and 98%, respectively. The mean time for obtaining results was shorter when using the nitrate reductase assay (10 days) compared to using the proportion method (28 days). Excellent agreement was observed between both phenotypic tests: 98%, 96%, 81% and 96% for RIF, INH, STR and EMB, respectively. Conclusions: The results showed that the nitrate reductase assay is suitable for the early determination of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and is a useful tool for the quick and accurate determination of a rapid M. tuberculosis drug-sensitivity test in countries having low resources.

10.1097_INF.0000000000000111	Pediatric Drug-resistant Tuberculosis in Madrid	Background: The rates of isoniazid (INH) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) among European children vary between 10.4% and 3.5%. Spain is a low endemic country with reported rates of 4.9% of INH resistance and 1.3% of MDR in adults. However, data regarding patterns of TB resistance in children are scarce. Our aim is to determine the incidence and risk factors for pediatric-resistant TB in our setting to help developing age-targeted guidelines. Methods: A multicenter, retrospective study including 22 hospitals from Madrid region (EREMITA study group) was performed from January 2005 to June 2010. Medical records from children diagnosed with TB were reviewed for demographic characteristics, clinical presentation and outcomes. Risk factors for INH and MDR TB were identified. Results: Of 396 children diagnosed with TB, 72.4% were born to foreign parents. Microbiologic confirmation by culture (n = 200) or PCR (n = 8) was documented in 208 children (52.5%). Drug susceptibility results were available in 188 children: 9.6% (n = 18) were resistant to INH and 3.1% (n = 6) were MDR. INH resistance was more common in immigrants compared with native families (11.9% vs. 0%; P = 0.013), as was also MDR (4.5% vs. 0%; P = 0.34). Extrapulmonary TB and previous antituberculous treatment were significantly associated with INH and MDR, while immunosuppression was associated only with MDR. Conclusions: The rates of INH and MDR TB were different according to the parents' origin, with higher rates among children born to foreign parents. Local surveillance of drug-resistant TB is critical to develop appropriate guidelines for treatment.	children; tuberculosis; drug resistance; MDR; immigration	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; TRANSMISSION PATTERNS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; IMMIGRATION; SPAIN; SURVEILLANCE; IMPACT; POPULATIONS
10.1007_s15010_013_0572_2	Treatment outcomes of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients in Gauteng, South Africa	Purpose Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is associated with lengthy treatment, expensive and potentially toxic regimens, and high rates of treatment failure and death. This study describes the outcomes of 351 MDR-TB patients who started treatment between 2004 and 2007 at the provincial MDR-TB referral hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa, and investigates risk factors associated with death. Methods The study involved the assessment of factors associated with treatment outcomes using a retrospective review of patient records, drug-susceptibility data and spoligotyping of isolates. Results Treatment success (completion/cure) was recorded in 158 (48.8 %) patients, while 65 (20 %) died, 93 (28.7 %) defaulted, 8 (2.5 %) failed treatment, 11(3.1 %) were transferred out to other health facilities and 16 (4.6 %) had no recorded final outcome. The proportion of successful treatment increased significantly over time. Univariable and multivariable analysis (P = 0.05) identified the year of MDR-TB diagnosis and spoligotype-defined families as factors associated with treatment outcome. No associations were found between treatment outcome and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, previous TB and additional MDR resistance to streptomycin or ethambutol. Molecular typing of the strains revealed a diverse group of spoligotypes, with Beijing, LAM4 and H3 making up the largest groups.

10.1183_09031936.00203613	High risk and rapid appearance of multidrug resistance during tuberculosis treatment in Moldova	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a serious problem in the former Soviet Union and may appear during TB treatment. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of, timing of and factors associated with MDR-TB diagnosis during TB treatment in Moldova, which was part of the former Soviet Union. We analysed data on 3 754 confirmed non-MDR-TB cases (between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2010) in the Moldovan TB surveillance database, where patients provided sputum specimens for drug-susceptibility testing, multiple times, during treatment. We estimated the percentage of individuals with confirmed baseline non-MDR-TB that were diagnosed with MDR-TB during treatment, documented the time at which MDR-TB was diagnosed, and used a failure-time model to identify factors associated with MDR-TB diagnosis. Between 7.2% and 9.2% of initially non-MDR-TB cases were diagnosed with MDR-TB during treatment. Half of these MDR-TB diagnoses occurred with 3 months of the initial diagnosis. An increased MDR-TB risk during treatment was associated with baseline resistance to first-line TB drugs (linear increase in risk per additional drug), previous incarceration and HIV co-infection. MDR can appear rapidly during TB treatment. Policy considerations should emphasise management during early treatment by increasing ambulatory TB treatment to prevent nosocomial transmission, and ensuring universal rapid diagnostics access to prevent acquisition and transmission of drug resistance.

10.1016_j.homp.2013.12.003	Homeopathic treatment in addition to standard care in multi drug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis: a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial	Background: Multi drug resistant-tuberculosis (MDR-TB) [resistant to Isoniazid and Rifampicin] is a major global public health problem. In India the incidence is rising in spite of implementation of Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program. Standard MDR-TB drugs are second generation antibiotics taken for 24-27 months. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of add on homeopathic intervention to the standard MDR-TB regimen (SR). Methods: A randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study was conducted from 2003 to 2008. 120 diagnosed MDR-TB patients (both culture positive and negative) were enrolled and randomized to receive Standard Regimen + individualized homeopathic medicine (SR + H) or Standard Regimen + identical placebo (SR + P). The medicines have been used in infrequent doses. The outcome measures were sputum conversion, changes in chest X-ray (CXR), hemoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), weight gain, and clinical improvement. Results: There was an improvement in all the outcome measures as per intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses. ITT analyses revealed sputum culture conversion from positive to negative in 23 (38.3%) in SR + H; 23 (38.3%) patients in SR + P group; (p = 0.269) and 27 (55.1); 21(42.8%), p = 0.225 as PP analyses. The mean weight gain in SR + H group was 2.4 +/- 4.9 and in SR + P was 0.8 +/- 4.4; [p = 0.071], reduction in ESR in SR + H was -8.7 +/- 13.2; SR + P was 3.9 +/- 15.4 [p = 0.068]. The mean increase in hemoglobin was by 0.6 +/- 1.7 in SR + H & 0.3 +/- 2.3 [p = 0.440] in SR + P group at 95% confidence interval. Statistically significant improvement was seen in CXR in 37 (61.7%) in SR + H and 20 (33.3%) patients in SR + P group (p = 0.002). Subgroup analyses of culture positive patients showed statistically significant improvement in CXR (p = 0.0005), weight gain (p = 0.026), increase in hemoglobin (p = 0.017) and reduction in ESR (p = 0.025) with add on homeopathy. The cure rate was 11.4% more in SR + H group as compared to placebo group. Change in sputum culture conversion, was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Add on homeopathy in addition to standard therapy appears to improve outcome in MDR-TB. Larger scale studies using a standardized homeopathic treatment regime should be conducted.

10.5588_ijtld.13.0429	Are we justified in treating for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis based on positive follow-up smear results?	SETTING: National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, India. OBJECTIVE: To assess, among new culture-confirmed smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients, the proportion of follow-up smear-positives that were culture-negative (S+C-) by month of follow-up examination, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, pre-treatment drug susceptibility status and smear grading. DESIGN: We extracted follow-up smear (fluorescence microscopy) and culture (Lowenstein-Jensen) results of patients enrolled in clinical trials from January 2000 to August 2012 and treated with the WHO Category I regimen (2EHRZ(3)/4HR(3)). RESULTS: Of 520 patients, including 176 who were HIV-infected, respectively 199, 81, 47 and 43 were smear-positive at months 2, 4, 5 and 6; of these, respectively 138 (69%), 62 (75%), 32 (68%) and 27 (63%) were culture-negative. The S+C- phenomenon was more pronounced among '1+ positive' patients than in 2+ or 3+ positive patients and in 'pan-susceptible' patients than in those with any resistance, and did not vary by HIV status. CONCLUSION: Nearly two thirds of patients with follow-up smears positive at months 5 and 6 were culture-negative. Starting multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) treatment empirically based on smear results, even in resource-limited settings, is incorrect and can have hazardous consequences. There is an urgent need to revisit the WHO recommendation concerning empirical MDR-TB treatment.	empiric MDR-TB treatment; S plus C-phenomenon; sputum smear; sputum culture; pulmonary tuberculosis	ACID-FAST BACILLI; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; SPUTUM SMEARS; INITIAL TREATMENT; THERAPY TRIAL; RIFAMPICIN
10.5588_ijtld.13.0736	Evaluation of indirect drug susceptibility testing using the MODS assay for the detection of XDR-TB in China	SETTING: The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University and the Chest Hospital of Jiangxi Province, Jiangxi, China. OBJECTIVE: To assess the performance and feasibility of the microscopic observation drug susceptibility (MODS) assay for the simultaneous detection of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in a high-burden, resource-limited setting. METHODS: A total of 208 archived clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were used to compare MODS with the conventional proportion method for the rapid detection of resistance to rifampicin (RMP) and isoniazid (INH), as well as to the second-line drugs ofloxacin (OFX) and kanamycin (KM). RESULTS: Sensitivity was respectively 94.5%, 91%, 96.2% and 91.5% for RMP, INH, OFX and KM, and specificity was respectively 97.5%, 96%, 100% and 98.7%. Results for MODS were obtained in a median time of 7 days (range 5-17). CONCLUSION: The MODS assay offers a simple, rapid, economical and feasible method for the detection of M. tuberculosis resistance to first- and second-line drugs in resource-limited settings.

10.1128_AAC.01792_13	Molecular Characterization of Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates from China	To investigate the molecular characterization of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates from China and the association of specific mutations conferring drug resistance with strains of different genotypes, we performed spoligotyping and sequenced nine loci (katG, inhA, the oxyR-ahpC intergenic region, rpoB, tlyA, eis, rrs, gyrA, and gyrB) for 128 MDR-TB isolates. Our results showed that 108 isolates (84.4%) were Beijing family strains, 64 (59.3%) of which were identified as modern Beijing strains. Compared with the phenotypic data, the sensitivity and specificity of DNA sequencing were 89.1% and 100.0%, respectively, for isoniazid (INH) resistance, 93.8% and 100.0% for rifampin (RIF) resistance, 60.0% and 99.4% for capreomycin (CAP) resistance, 84.6% and 99.4% for kanamycin (KAN) resistance, and 90.0% and 100.0% for ofloxacin (OFX) resistance. The most prevalent mutations among the MDR-TB isolates were katG315, inhA15, rpoB531, -526, and -516, rrs1401, eis-10, and gyrA94, -90, and -91. Furthermore, there was no association between specific resistance-conferring mutations and the strain genotype. These findings will be helpful for the establishment of rapid molecular diagnostic methods to be implemented in China.

10.1128_AAC.02658_13	Novel Regimens Identified in Mice for Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in Contacts of Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Preventing the development of tuberculosis (TB) in contacts of patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) by the treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) is highly desirable. However, few safe, well tolerated, and effective drugs are available to treat MDR-LTBI and the published guidance is limited. Fortunately, six new chemical entities from four classes developed to treat TB have entered clinical trials in the past decade. We tested three of these drugs alone and in combination in an experimental paucibacillary LTBI chemotherapy model using BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ mice immunized with a recombinant strain of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (rBCG30) and then challenged with a low-dose aerosol of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The regimens tested contained bedaquiline (TMC), PA-824 (Pa), sutezolid (PNU), and/or one of two fluoroquinolones. Control mice received rifampin (RIF) or isoniazid (INH). In BALB/c mice, TMC-containing regimens and the Pa-PNU combination were the most active test regimens and were at least as effective as RIF. Pa, PNU, and levofloxacin had activity comparable to that of INH. Virtually identical results were observed in C3HeB/FeJ mice. This study confirms the potent activity of TMC observed previously in BALB/c mice and highlights Pa alone or in combination with either PNU or a fluoroquinolone as a regimen worthy of evaluation in future clinical trials of MDR-LTBI. Given their closer pathological representation of human TB lesions, C3HeB/FeJ mice may become a preferred model for the experimental chemotherapy of LTBI. Future studies should evaluate additional clinically relevant LTBI regimens in this strain including relapse as an endpoint.

10.1007_s40261_014_0172_7	Dose Regimen of Para-Aminosalicylic Acid Gastro-Resistant Formulation (PAS-GR) in Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	"Resurgence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has raised a renewed interest in para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) and other efficacious drugs. A gastro-resistant granule formulation (PAS-GR) was designed to be better tolerated than earlier forms of PAS, with fewer adverse effects from reduced production of meta-aminophenol. PAS release from PAS-GR granules is slower than with earlier formulations. Pharmacokinetic data are, however, limited and only a few studies have assisted in defining the best PAS-GR dose regimen. Interest in refining the latter continues and recent data contributed in better defining the optimal PAS-GR dose regimen in adults and children. The present paper draws on these recent studies, synthesizes pharmacokinetic results from different population groups, and draws comparisons with in vitro data and the results of earlier pharmacokinetic studies in order to discuss the most appropriate dosing regimen for PAS-GR. A comparative in vitro dissolution study was carried out with a 1 g acid PAS equivalent of various formulations of PAS and PAS-GR and in vitro-in vivo correlations. Retrospective comparisons between recent and earlier clinical studies were also gathered to clarify the dose regimen of PAS-GR in adults and children. Exposure after a 4 g twice- or three times daily dose regimen in adult MDR-TB patients confirmed that both dose regimens can be used. The twice-daily dose regimen does not, however, confer any safety margin over the potentiality of ""too"" high plasma concentrations after a three times daily dose regimen and may lead to under-dosage when a dose is missed, as compliance often decreases over time. Based on available data and practical considerations, a 4 g three times daily dose regimen of PAS-GR should be the preferred dose in hospital settings, where it remains the best regimen to cover the around-the-clock suppression of mycobacteria based on the minimal inhibitory concentration for PAS. In MDR-TB adults and in hospital settings, there is no safety advantage in administering a regimen of 4 g twice daily. As compliance is critical to the effectiveness of the treatment, a 4 g three times daily dose regimen may be more forgiving if the patient misses a dose."		GRANULES
10.1007_s00431_013_2196_z	Epidemiology of childhood tuberculosis in Switzerland between 1996 and 2011	Approximately 9 million cases of tuberculosis (TB) are reported annually and half a million occur in children < 15 years of age. Globally, TB notifications in children have been neglected for decades although childhood TB may represent a sentinel for ongoing transmission. Data included in this study were collected from the TB database of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, which includes culture-confirmed TB and/or cases treated with a parts per thousand yen3 anti-mycobacterial drugs. Data from all children < 15 years of age reported between 1996 and 2011 were analyzed. A total of 320 cases of TB (166 cultures confirmed, 5 confirmed by nucleic acid amplification, 149 other than definite cases) were reported with an overall incidence rate of 1.6 per 100,000 children (range 1.2-2.2). A total of 154 (48 %) children were younger than 5 years of age and 141 (44 %) were born in Switzerland. Children below 5 years of age were more likely to be Swiss-born compared to children aged 10 to 14 years (74 % versus 26 %). When analyzing the country of origin, only 55 children (17 %) were of Swiss origin. Of all children with foreign origin, 117 (47 %) were from a country within the WHO European Region. In 288 (90 %) of all notified cases, the site of disease was the lung. Mycobacterial culture was positive in 166 cases (51.9 %) with 1.8 % multi-drug-resistance. The overall incidence of childhood TB disease reported in Switzerland remained stable over a 16-year period with a remarkable high rate of very young patients of foreign origin. Only half of the reported cases were culture confirmed, highlighting the need for better diagnostic tests in childhood TB.

10.5588_ijtld.13.0742	Community-based treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis in Khayelitsha, South Africa	SETTING: Khayelitsha, South Africa, a pen-urban township with high burdens of tuberculosis (TB), drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. OBJECTIVE: To describe case detection and patient outcomes in a community-based DR-TB programme. DESIGN: DR-TB management was integrated into primary health care in Khayelitsha from 2007 onwards. Implementation was incremental, and included training and clinician support, counselling and home visits, tuberculous infection control, a local in-patient service, and routine monitoring. Patients received treatment rapidly through their local clinic, and were only hospitalised if clinically unwell. RESULTS: DR-TB case notification (any rifampicin resistance) increased from 28 per 100 000 population per year (2005-2007) to 55/100 000/year in 2009-2011 (72% HIV-infected). From 2008 to 2011, 754 patients received treatment (86% of those diagnosed). The median time between diagnostic sputum and treatment decreased over the years of implementation to 27 days in 2011 (P < 0.001). Treatment success was 52% in 2010, with 31% default, 13% death and 4% treatment failure. Two-year survival was 65%, with poorer survival in those with HIV (HR 2.0, 95%CI 1.4-2.8), second-line drug resistance (HR 3.3, 95%CI 2.2-4.8), and diagnosis in earlier programme years (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-2.0). CONCLUSION: Community-based DR-TB management is feasible, and contributes to improved case detection, reduced treatment delay and improved survival. Treatment outcomes remain poor, highlighting the poor efficacy, tolerability and lengthy duration of current treatment.

10.2807_1560_7917.ES2014.19.11.20736	Transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in a low-incidence setting, Switzerland, 2006 to 2012	The goal of the present study was to examine the transmission dynamics of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Switzerland. Between 2006 and 2012, a total of 49 MDR-TB cases were reported to the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, 46 of which were of foreign origin. All 49 initial strains were evaluated by molecular epidemiologic methods at the Swiss National Reference Centre for Mycobacteria. In 43 strains, unique DNA fingerprint patterns were identified. Twelve strains were grouped into six clusters. Data from contact tracing suggest likely in-country transmission in four clusters, mostly among close contacts. In the remaining two clusters, no contact tracing data were available, but the identified genotypes were known to be prevalent in the countries of origin of the patients, suggesting the possibility that the infection was acquired there. While most MDR-TB cases are imported to Switzerland, at least four of the 49 MDR-TB cases were due to transmission within the country. The imported cases, however, did not lead to secondary cases outside the circles of close contacts. The results also indicate that prevention of MDR-TB transmission among immigrants may require closer monitoring.		MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; FITNESS
10.2807_1560_7917.ES2014.19.11.20743	Geographical heterogeneity of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Georgia, January 2009 to June 2011	In 2011, Georgia, in the Caucasus, reported that 11% of new and 32% of previously treated tuberculosis (TB) cases nationally had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). To help understand the mechanisms driving these high risks of drug-resistance and plan for targeted interventions, we identified geographical variability in the MDR-TB burden in Georgia and patient-level MDR-TB risk factors. We used routinely collected surveillance data on notified TB cases to estimate the MDR-TB incidence/100,000 people and the percentage of TB cases with MDR-TB for each of 65 districts and regression modelling to identify patient-level MDR-TB risk factors. 1,795 MDR-TB cases were reported (January 2009-June 2011); the nationwide notified MDR-TB incidence was 16.2/100,000 but far higher (837/100,000) in the penitentiary system. We found substantial geographical heterogeneity between districts in the average annual MDR-TB incidence/100,000 (range: 0.0-5.0 among new and 0.0-18.9 among previously treated TB cases) and the percentage of TB cases with MDR-TB (range: 0.0%-33.3% among new and 0.0%-75.0% among previously treated TB cases). Among treatment-naive individuals, those in cities had greater MDR-TB risk than those in rural areas (increased odds: 43%; 95% confidence interval: 20%-72%). These results suggest that interventions for interrupting MDR-TB transmission are urgently needed in prisons and urban areas.		DRUG-RESISTANCE; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; PREVALENCE; SURVEILLANCE
pub-0838	Drug resistance among tuberculosis cases in the European Union and European Economic Area, 2007 to 2012	The European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) tuberculosis (TB) surveillance system collects detailed information on resistance to TB drugs. Using this information, we provide an overview of the current TB drug resistance situation and trends in the EU/EEA by performing a descriptive analysis, including analysis of treatment outcomes, of the TB cases reported between January 2007 and December 2012. The percentages of TB cases with different drug resistance patterns have been stable with about 90% of the new laboratory-confirmed cases pan-susceptible, 6% monodrug- resistant, 2% polydrug-resistant, 2% multidrug drug-resistant (MDR) TB - excluding extensively drugresistant (XDR) TB -, and 0.2% XDR-TB. In previously treated laboratory-confirmed TB cases, the percentage with MDR-TB excluding XDR-TB declined until 2010 to 16% and remained stable thereafter. During the study period, the percentages of cases with monodrug- and polydrug-resistant TB remained constant at about 8% and 2% whereas the percentage of XDR-TB cases increased slightly to 2.6%. Treatment outcome results for all cases have been stable with overall 77.9% of the pan-susceptible cases, 69.6% of the monoresistant cases, 68.2% of the polyresistant cases, 32.2% of the MDR-TB cases (excluding XDR-TB), and 19.1% of the XDR-TB cases treated successfully. The treatment success rate target for new pulmonary culture-positive MDR-TB cases of 70% has not been reached. In addition, drug resistance surveillance can be improved by more complete reporting of drug susceptibility results and treatment outcome.

10.1371_journal.pone.0090868	High Rates of Potentially Infectious Tuberculosis and Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) among Hospital Inpatients in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa Indicate Risk of Nosocomial Transmission	Background: Nosocomial transmission has been implicated as a key factor in the outbreak of extensively drug resistant (XDR) and multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) tuberculosis at Church of Scotland Hospital (CoSH), in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. The aim of this study was to quantify the burden of potentially infectious tuberculosis and the proportion of drug resistance among hospital inpatients throughout the province of KZN. Methods: Inpatients with current cough, capable of producing sputum were selected from 19 public hospitals in KZN. After informed consent, demographic and clinical data, and sputum samples were collected. Samples were processed for fluorescent microscopy, liquid culture and first and second-line anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing. Results: There were a total of 2,964 inpatients where sampling was done. About 1,585 inpatients (53%) had a current cough and sufficient microbiological and clinical data for inclusion. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated from 543 inpatients (34% of those tested and 18% of all inpatients). Eighty-four (15%) inpatients with TB were found to be MDR-TB infected and 16 (3%) had XDR-TB. There was no association between the prevalence of MDR-TB and proximity to CoSH. Among patients with microbiologically confirmed TB, MDR/XDR-TB was associated with male sex, a longer length of stay between hospital admission and date of sample collection, and current or previous TB treatment. Conclusions: One in five inpatients had potentially infectious TB. This is an underestimate since patients without current cough were not tested. MDR-TB was frequently observed and was found in nearly one in six active TB inpatients. While present at lower levels than the original outbreak report at CoSH, XDR-TB was detected in hospitals throughout KZN. The high burden of potentially infectious TB and confirmed MDR-TB, much of it undiagnosed, indicates a serious risk for nosocomial transmission and the need for intensified infection control within the inpatient setting.

10.1371_journal.pone.0089822	Disease Control Implications of India's Changing Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis Epidemic	Background: Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) is a major health challenge in India that is gaining increasing public attention, but the implications of India's evolving MDR TB epidemic are poorly understood. As India's MDR TB epidemic is transitioning from a treatment-generated to transmission-generated epidemic, we sought to evaluate the potential effectiveness of the following two disease control strategies on reducing the prevalence of MDR TB: a) improving treatment of non-MDR TB; b) shortening the infectious period between the activation of MDR TB and initiation of effective MDR treatment. Methods and Findings: We developed a dynamic transmission microsimulation model of TB in India. The model followed individuals by age, sex, TB status, drug resistance status, and treatment status and was calibrated to Indian demographic and epidemiologic TB time trends. The main effectiveness measure was reduction in the average prevalence reduction of MDR TB over the ten years after control strategy implementation. We find that improving non-MDR cure rates to avoid generating new MDR cases will provide substantial non-MDR TB benefits but will become less effective in reducing MDR TB prevalence over time because more cases will occur from direct transmission - by 2015, the model estimates 42% of new MDR cases are transmission-generated and this proportion continues to rise over time, assuming equal transmissibility of MDR and drug-susceptible TB. Strategies that disrupt MDR transmission by shortening the time between MDR activation and treatment are projected to provide greater reductions in MDR prevalence compared with improving non-MDR treatment quality: implementing MDR diagnostic improvements in 2017 is expected to reduce MDR prevalence by 39%, compared with 11% reduction from improving non-MDR treatment quality. Conclusions: As transmission-generated MDR TB becomes a larger driver of the MDR TB epidemic in India, rapid and accurate MDR TB diagnosis and treatment will become increasingly effective in reducing MDR TB cases compared to non-MDR TB treatment improvements.

10.1179_2047773214Y.0000000133	High prevalence of non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease among non-HIV infected individuals in a TB endemic country - experience from a tertiary center in Delhi, India	Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) considered mostly as colonizers or ignored as environmental contaminants in the past, are now increasingly recognized as important pulmonary pathogens in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent population. 1 Specific risk factors identified are HIV infection, cystic fibrosis, underlying chronic lung disease, previous tuberculosis (TB), and work in the mining industry. 1 These are also reported to cause surgical-site infections, post-injection abscesses, osteomyelitis, catheter-related blood-stream infections, and central nervous system infections. 2 Non-tuberculous mycobacteria rates of infection and disease has significantly increased in recent years and rates vary widely depending on population and geographic location. 1 Most reports are from developed countries that have low rates of TB. However, in countries with high burden of TB, including India, NTM pulmonary disease often goes unrecognized and is misdiagnosed as pulmonary TB because clinical presentation of NTM and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) diseases are indistinguishable from each other. Prevalence of NTM is unknown in India as NTM disease is not a reportable condition and there is lack of awareness among clinicians coupled with lack of laboratory capacity to diagnose these infections. 3 Among few reports available, NTM isolation rates are reported to range from 0.5 to 8.6% in India. 4 A recent study from central India reported prevalence of NTM increased from 1.0% in 2005 to 3.5% in 2008 and 88.6% of the NTM isolated were clinically relevant. 4 Identification of NTM is of clinical relevance as most of the NTM are notably resistant or only partially susceptible to the standard anti-tubercular drugs and the treatment strategies and the duration of these infections differ from MTB. We conducted retrospective review of isolation rates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) and NTM, the species of NTM characterized and their clinical significance during January 2011-June 2012 at our tertiary care hospital (700 bedded) in Delhi, India. The study was approved by the ethical committee of our institute. A total of 436 clinical specimens were processed for mycobacteria culture, 237 from pulmonary (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial wash, and endotracheal aspirates) and 199 from extrapulmonary sites (urine, pus, peritoneal fluid, lymph node aspirate, synovial fluid, endometrial biopsy, CSF). Specimens were digested and decontaminated by the standard N-acetyl-L-cysteine- NaOH method and inoculated into BACTEC mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) 960 vials (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD, USA) and Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium slants (Hi Media laboratories, Mumbai, India). Smear microscopic examination was performed using Zeihl Neelsen (ZN) and fluorochrome stains. All positive MGIT vials were subjected to identification of MTC, by p-nitrobenzoic acid (PNBA) assay on MGIT 960 as described elsewhere 5 and SD TB MPT64 antigen rapid assay by immunochromatographic method (Standard Diagnostics, Seoul, South Korea). p-Nitrobenzoic acid resistant and/or MPB 64 antigen negative isolates (suspected to be NTM) were subjected to a multiplex PCR using primers for mycobacterium genus (targeting hsp65), MTC (targeting ESAT6), and Mycobacterium avium complex (targeting MAC) specific genes. 3 Confirmed NTM isolates were further speciated by pigment production, growth on MacConkey agar, rate of growth, nitrate reduction test, tellurite reduction, urease production, tween-80 hydrolysis, arylsulfatase, heat-stable catalase, iron uptake, and tolerance to 5% NaCl. 6 Drug-susceptibility testing was performed for MTC for PSIRE (pyrazinamide, streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol) by BACTEC MGIT 960 (1% proportional method). Of 436 specimens, 109 (25.6%) were positive for acid-fast bacilli by smear microscopy (ZN and/or fluorescent) and 131 (30.7%) specimens were culture positive. Of 131 positive cultures, 118 (90.1%) isolates were identified as MTC (71.2% from pulmonary and 28.8% from extrapulmonary samples) and 13 (9.9%) isolates as NTM species. The NTM were isolated from pulmonary specimens in nine (69.2%) patients, and four (30.8%) were isolated from non-pulmonary specimens, one each from urine, ascitic fluid, bone, and blood specimens. The most common NTM species characterized was Mycobacterium kansasii (4) followed byMycobacterium chelonae (3), Mycobacterium xenopi (2), Mycobacterium scrofulaceum (1), M. avium (1), Mycobacterium asiaticum (1), and Mycobacterium fortuitum (1). Clinical details and speciation of the NTMs isolated are shown in Table 1. Fluorescent staining was more sensitive as it detected 12 additional culture positive cases that were negative by ZN stain (of these, four were NTM). As NTM are ubiquitous in nature, NTM pulmonary infections consistent with the American thoracic society (ATS) and British thoracic society (BTS) guidelines (defined in Table 1) were considered clinically relevant. 7,8 Of nine patients with pulmonary NTM isolated, seven (77.9%) had definite NTM disease and two (15.4%) had probable NTM disease; among four patients with extrapulmonary specimens, two (50%) had definite NTM disease, one (25%) had probable NTM disease, and one (25%) had possible disease or colonization (Table 1). Majority of patients were males (69.2%) and 46.1% (6/13) were older in age (>= 60 years). The main underlying risk factors found to be associated with NTM infections were pre-existing pulmonary disease (54%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 23.1%), past and/or present history of TB (30.8%, two pulmonary TB and one Pott's spine cases were diagnosed by both smear for AFB and culture positivity for MTB and a case of osteomyelitis was smear positive for AFB), chronic smoking (15.4%), diabetes (23.1%), steroids (7.6%), and malignancy (7.6%). No predisposing condition was detected in three patients (23.1%). All 13 patients with NTM disease were HIV seronegative (ARCHITECTH HIV Ag/Ab Combo Assay, Abbott diagnostics). Between PNBA and MPB64 antigen assay results, 100% concordance was observed. All mycobacteria grew both in MGIT and LJ medium; however mean isolation time was much shorter with MGIT than with LJ (11 vs 28 days). Furthermore, mean recovery time of MTC from pulmonary specimens was lesser than that of non-pulmonary specimens (10 vs 16 days) by MGIT culture. Among NTMs, slow-growing mycobacteria grew in mean time of 12.9 days. Rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) bloodstream infection due to M. chelonae in one of the patient could be detected by MGIT in 2.2 days. Of the MTC, 67% were sensitive to all tested drugs, 14.7% were multidrugresistant (MDR), and 17.6% were mono-resistant. Treatment details of the patients were not retrieved. While clinical diagnosis of NTM pulmonary disease is challenging, reliance only on positive smear microscopy for the initiation of treatment for suspected TB in most TB endemic countries and not on Mycobacteria culture, species identification, and drug-resistance testing results, is unfortunate as acid-fast bacilli visualized in smears may not necessarily be MTB. Moreover, NTM co-infections with MTB disease are not infrequent, though rarely diagnosed. 10 As NTM strains exhibits high drugresistance to first-line anti-tubercular drugs, many of NTM infections would be considered TB treatment failures, and subsequently treated for multidrugresistant TB (MDR-TB) disease. The same was highlighted in a recent report from China, where NTM accounted for 30% of suspected MDR-TB cases and 4% of retreatment TB cases. 11 In another study from New Delhi, India, detected NTM were detected by multiplex PCR in 17.6% of the suspected MDR-pulmonary TB cases and in 12.4% of the suspected extrapulmonary TB cases. 3 These findings highlight the necessity of laboratory speciation of mycobacteria and initiation of treatment for mycobacterial infections based on in vitro susceptibility testing. In the present study, 12 of the 13 NTM infections (92.3%) were provisionally diagnosed as pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB based on clinical presentation and smear microscopy findings. Of these, three patients (23.1%) having past history of TB were considered for retreatment (MDR-TB suspected) and one patient was found to be co-infected with MTB (pulmonary NTM and Pott's spine). None of the patient in this series was HIV seropositive. In a recent 3 years study from India, 42% of AFB cultures were positive and approximately 2% of these were NTM. Pulmonary infections represented 81% of all NTM cases and the major predisposing condition was underlying lung disease (54%) including 40% patients with a past or present [GRAPHICS] [GRAPHICS] history of pulmonary TB while only 2% patients were known HIV-positive.(12) High prevalence of NTM infections observed among non-HIV seropositive individuals in a TB endemic country in this report, underscores the need for increased awareness of these emerging human pathogens and importance of mycobacteria speciation to reduce morbidity and mortality resulting from these diseases. Use of liquid culture medium and molecular methods in clinical laboratories can significantly reduce turn-around time particularly for diagnosis of infections due to slow-growing NTM and MDR-TB. However, with improved facilities for recovery of NTMs that may result in increased frequency of isolation of these organisms, NTM disease requires clinical correlation and differentiation from colonization.

10.1590_S1806_37132014000200009	Drug-resistant tuberculosis in subjects included in the Second National Survey on Antituberculosis Drug Resistance in Porto Alegre, Brazil	Objective: To describe the prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) among tuberculosis patients in a major Brazilian city, evaluated via the Second National Survey on Antituberculosis Drug Resistance, as well as the social, demographic, and clinical characteristics of those patients. Methods: Clinical samples were collected from tuberculosis patients seen between 2006 to 2007 at three hospitals and five primary health care clinics participating in the survey in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil. The samples were subjected to drug susceptibility testing. The species of mycobacteria was confirmed using biochemical methods. Results: Of the 299 patients included, 221 (73.9%) were men and 77 (27.3%) had a history of tuberculosis. The mean age was 36 years. Of the 252 patients who underwent HIV testing, 66 (26.2%) tested positive. The prevalence of MDR-TB in the sample as a whole was 4.7% (95% CI: 2.3-7.1), whereas it was 2.2% (950/0 CI: 0.3-4.2) among the new cases of tuberculosis and 12.0% (95% CI: 4.5-19.5) among the patients with a history of tuberculosis treatment. The multivariate analysis showed that a history of tuberculosis and a longer time to diagnosis were both associated with MDR-TB. Conclusions: lf our results are corroborated by other studies conducted in Brazil, a history of tuberculosis treatment and a longer time to diagnosis could be used as predictors of MDR-TB.

10.1016_j.jdiacomp.2013.12.003	Effect of diabetes on treatment outcome of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis-A report from South India	Aim: To assess the effect of diabetes on tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcome and sputum conversion among new smear-positive (NSP) cases registered under Directly Observed Treatment Short Course in South India. Methods: Details on sputum conversion and TB treatment outcome were collected from case records of NSP cases (N = 332; M/F 247:85) registered at TB units of three districts in Tamil Nadu. Subjects were screened for diabetes and categorized as diabetic (TBDM) (n = 96; 73:23) and non-diabetic (TBnonDM) (n = 149; 109:40). Results: Among 245 selected TB patients, 93.5% were cured, 1.6% completed TB treatment, 2% had TB treatment failure (TF), and 0.4% had treatment default (TD), 0.4% with MDR-TB and 2% death rate. At the end of intensive phase of TB treatment, 14.7% remained sputum positive in the TBDM group, whereas it was 3.5% in the TBnonDM group. Mean duration (days) for sputum conversion was higher in the TBDM group (64.2 +/- 10.5) compared to the TBnonDM group (61.5 +/- 7.5) (p < 0.001). TF rate was higher (4.2% vs 0.7%) and MDR-TB (1%) was also seen in the TBDM group. No death and TD were seen among DM whereas it was 3.4 and 0.7% in TBnonDM. Conclusions: Delayed sputum conversion and high TB treatment failure rates were common in NSP cases with diabetes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

10.1016_j.ijantimicag.2013.12.007	Beijing genotype of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is significantly associated with linezolid resistance in multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in China	Linezolid (LNZ) is a promising antimicrobial agent for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB). To investigate the efficacy of LNZ among MDR-TB and XDR-TB in China, the LNZ susceptibility of 158 MDR-TB isolates from the national drug resistance survey was determined by the minimum inhibitory concentration method. The 158 MDR-TB isolates were also sequenced in the 23S rRNA, rplC and rplD genes conferring LNZ resistance and were typed using spoligotyping to identify the Beijing genotype of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Overall, the prevalence of LNZ-resistant isolates was 10.8% (171158) among MDR-TB isolates circulating in China. Beijing genotype was significantly associated with LNZ resistance in MDR-TB and XDR-TB (odds ratio=4.66, 95% confidence interval 1.03-21.16; P=0.033). In addition, a higher frequency of LNZ-resistant isolates was observed among XDR-TB strains (60%) compared with the MDR (5.6%; P<0.001) and pre-XDR groups (12.2%; P=0.004). Mutations in 23S rRNA and rplC were responsible for only 29.4% of LNZ-resistant M. tuberculosis among MDR-TB isolates, and a novel non-synonymous substitution His155Asp in rplC was first identified to be contributing to low-level LNZ resistance (2 mu g/mL) in M. tuberculosis. The unsatisfactory correlation between mutant genotypes highlights the urgent need to investigate another mechanism for LNZ resistance that has not yet been described.

10.3201_eid2003.130951	Use of Drug-Susceptibility Testing for Management of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis, Thailand, 2004-2008	In 2004, routine use of culture and drug-susceptibility testing (DST) was implemented for persons in 5 Thailand provinces with a diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). To determine if DST results were being used to guide treatment, we conducted a retrospective chart review for patients with rifampin-resistant or multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB during 2004-2008. A total of 208 patients were identified. Median time from clinical sample collection to physician review of DST results was 114 days. Only 5.8% of patients with MDR TB were empirically prescribed an appropriate regimen; an additional 31.3% received an appropriate regimen after DST results were reviewed. Most patients with rifampin -resistant or MDR TB had successful treatment outcomes. Patients with HIV co-infection and patients who were unmarried or had received category II treatment before DST results were reviewed had less successful outcomes. Overall, review of. available DST results Was delayed, and results were rarely used to improve treatment.		MDR-TB; RETREATMENT REGIMEN; DIAGNOSIS; TIME; PERU
10.3201_eid2003.131083	Minimal Diversity of Drug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Strains, South Africa	Multidrug- (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) are commonly associated with Beijing strains. However, in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, which has among the highest incidence and mortality for MDR and XDR TB, data suggest that non-Beijing strains are driving the epidemic. We conducted a retrospective study to characterize the strain prevalence among drug-susceptible, MDR, and XDR TB cases and determine associations between strain type and survival. Among 297 isolates from 2005-2006, 49 spoligotype patterns were found. Predominant strains were Beijing (ST1) among drug-susceptible isolates (27%), S/Quebec (ST34) in MDR TB (34%) and LAM4/KZN (ST60) in XDR TB (89%). More than 90% of patients were HIV co-infected. MDR TB and XDR TB were independently associated with mortality, but TB strain type was not. We conclude that, although Beijing strain was common among drug-susceptible TB, other strains predominated among MDR TB and XDR TB cases. Drug-resistance was a stronger predictor of survival than strain type.

10.1016_j.jinf.2013.09.034	Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in HIV positive patients in Eastern Europe	Observational data from Eastern Europe on the management and outcome of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) in HIV positive populations remain sparse in the English-language literature. We compared clinical characteristics and outcomes of 55 patients who were diagnosed with HIV and MDR TB in Eastern Europe between 2004 and 2006 to 89 patients whose Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were susceptible to isoniazid and rifampicin. Patients with HIV and MDR TB were young and predominantly male with high rates of intravenous drug use, imprisonment and hepatitis C co-infection. Eighty-four per cent of patients with MDR TB had no history of previous TB drug exposure suggesting that the majority of MDR TB resulted from transmission of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis. The use of non-standardized tuberculosis treatment was common, and the use of antiretroviral therapy infrequent. Compared to those with susceptible tuberculosis, patients with MDR TB were less likely to achieve cure or complete tuberculosis treatment (21.8% vs. 62.9%, p < 0.0001), and they were more likely to die (65.5% vs. 27.0%, p < 0.0001). Our study documents suboptimal management and poor outcomes in HIV positive patients with MDR TB. Implementation of WHO guidelines, rapid TB diagnostics and TB drug susceptibility testing for all patients remain a priority in this region. (C) 2013 The British Infection Association.

10.1016_j.jiph.2013.09.001	Current status and future trends in the diagnosis and treatment of drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	The global burden of tuberculosis (TB) is still large. The increasing incidence of drug-resistant, multidrug-resistant (MDR) (resistant to at least rifampicin and isoniazid), and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) (additionally resistant to a fiuoroquinolone and kanamycin/amikacin/capreomycin) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the association of active disease with human immunodeficiency virus coinfection pose a major threat to TB control efforts. The rapid detection of M. tuberculosis strains and drug susceptibility testing (DST) for anti-TB drugs ensure the provision of effective treatment. Rapid molecular diagnostic and DST methods have been developed recently. Treatment of drug-susceptible TB is effective in >95% of disease cases; however, supervised therapy for >6 months is challenging. Nonadherence to treatment often results in the evolution of drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis due to mutations in the genes encoding drug targets. Sequential accumulation of mutations results in the evolution of MDR and XDR strains of M. tuberculosis. Effective treatment of MDR-TB involves therapy with 5-7 less effective, expensive, and toxic second-line and third-line drugs for >24 months and is difficult in most developing countries. XDR-TB is generally an untreatable disease in developing countries. Some currently existing drugs and several new drugs with novel modes of action are in various stages of development to shorten the treatment duration of drug-susceptible TB and to improve the outcome of MDR-TB and XDR-TB.

10.1016_S1995_7645_14_60019_5	Drug resistance pattern of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from patients of five provinces of Iran	Objective: To determine the patterns of resistance to first line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs among a collection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates from 5 provinces of Iran. Methods: A total of the 6 426 clinical specimens from patients suspected of active TB were collected from March 2010 to June 2012. All specimens were subjected for microscopy and culture tests in the TB centers of studies provinces. Drug susceptibility testing to the first line anti-TB drugs for culture positive MTB was performed on Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium using proportion method. Results: Of 6 426 clinical specimens, 261 were culture positive for mycobacteria, of which 252 were MTB and 9 were MOTT (mycobacteria other than tuberculosis). Of 252 MTB isolates, 211 (83.7%) were pan-susceptible and 41(16.3%) were resistant to at least one drug. Resistance was most common to streptomycin, 30 isolates (12.0%), followed by isoniazid, 20 isolates (8.0%), rifampin, 15 isolates (6.0%) and ethambutol, 14 isolates (5.5%). Sixteen (6.3%) MTB isolates were MDR. A clear evidence of heterogeneity amongst the 5 provinces in the proportions with resistance to one or more drugs was observed [chi(2) = 12.209 (4 degrees of freedom), P values = 0.015 9]. Conclusions: The prevalence of drug resistance in this study area underscoring the need for further enforcement of TB control strategies in the Iran. Drug susceptibility testing for all TB cases to provide optimal treatment, establishing advanced diagnostic facilities for rapid detection of MDR-TB and continuous monitoring of drug resistance are recommended for prevention and control of drug-resistant TB.

10.1021_jm401326j	Encoded Library Technology as a Source of Hits for the Discovery and Lead Optimization of a Potent and Selective Class of Bactericidal Direct Inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis InhA	Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the world's oldest and deadliest diseases, killing a person every 20 s. InhA, the enoyl-ACP reductase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is the target of the frontline antitubercular drug isoniazid (INH). Compounds that directly target InhA and do not require activation by mycobacterial catalase peroxidase KatG are promising candidates for treating infections caused by INH resistant strains. The application of the encoded library technology (ELT) to the discovery of direct InhA inhibitors yielded compound 7 endowed with good enzymatic potency but with low antitubercular potency. This work reports the hit identification, the selected strategy for potency optimization, the structure-activity relationships of a hundred analogues synthesized, and the results of the in vivo efficacy studies performed with the lead compound 65.

10.1186_1472_6963_14_81	"Home is where the patient is"": a qualitative analysis of a patient-centred model of care for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis"	Background: Ambulatory, community-based care for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has been found to be effective in multiple settings with high cure rates. However, little is known about patient preferences around models of MDR-TB care. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has delivered home-based MDR-TB treatment in the rural Kitgum and Lamwo districts of northern Uganda since 2009 in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the National TB and Leprosy Programme. We conducted a qualitative study examining the experience of patients and key stakeholders of home-based MDR-TB treatment. Methods: We used semi-structured interviews and focus-group discussions to examine patients' perceptions, views and experiences of home-based treatment and care for MDR-TB versus their perceptions of care in hospital. We identified how these perceptions interacted with those of their families and other stakeholders involved with TB. Participants were selected purposively following a stakeholder analysis. Sample size was determined by data saturation being reached within each identified homogenous category of respondents: health-care receiving, health-care providing and key informant. Iterative data collection and analysis enabled adaptation of topic guides and testing of emerging themes. The grounded theory method of analysis was applied, with data, codes and categories being continually compared and refined. Results: Several key themes emerged: the perceived preference and acceptability of home-based treatment and care as a model of MDR-TB treatment by patients, family, community members and health-care workers; the fear of transmission of other infections within hospital settings; and the identification of MDR-TB developing through poor adherence to and inadequate treatment regimens for DS-TB. Conclusions: Home-based treatment and care was acceptable to patients, families, communities and health-care workers and was seen as preferable to hospital-based care by most respondents. Home-based care was perceived as safe, conducive to recovery, facilitating psychosocial support and allowing more free time and earning potential for patients and caretakers. These findings could contribute to development of an adaptation of treatment approach strategy at national level.

10.1186_1471_2334_14_93	TB incidence and characteristics in the remote gulf province of Papua New Guinea: a prospective study	Background: The incidence and characteristics of tuberculosis (TB) in remote areas of Papua New Guinea (PNG) are largely unknown. The purpose of our study was to determine the incidence of TB in the Gulf Province of PNG and describe disease characteristics, co- morbidities and drug resistance profiles that could impact on disease outcomes and transmission. Methods: Between March 2012 and June 2012, we prospectively collected data on 274 patients presenting to Kikori Hospital with a presumptive diagnosis of TB, and on hospital inpatients receiving TB treatment during the study period. Sputum was collected for microscopy, GeneXpert analysis, culture and genotyping of isolates. Results: We estimate the incidence of TB in Kikori to be 1290 per 100,000 people (95% CI 1140 to 1460) in 2012. The proportion of TB patients co-infected with HIV was 1.9%. Three of 32 TB cases tested were rifampicin resistant. Typing of nine isolates demonstrated allelic diversity and most were related to Beijing strains. Conclusions: The incidence of TB in Kikori is one of the highest in the world and it is not driven by HIV co-infection. The high incidence and the presence of rifampicin resistant warrant urgent attention to mitigate substantial morbidity in the region.

10.1371_journal.pone.0088330	Are We Doing Enough to Stem the Tide of Acquired MDR-TB in Countries with High TB Burden? Results of a Mixed Method Study in Chongqing, China	Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) represents a threat to health and development in countries with high TB burden. China's MDR-TB prevalence rate of 6.8% is the highest in the world. Interventions to remove barriers against effective TB control, and prevention of MDR-TB are urgently needed in the country. This paper reports a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of 513 pulmonary TB (PTB) patients, and qualitative interviews of 10 healthcare workers (HCWs), and 15 PTB patients. The objective was to assess barriers against effective control of PTB and prevention of MDR-TB by elucidating the perspectives of patients and healthcare providers. Results showed that more than half of the patients experienced patient delay of over 12.5 days. A similar proportion also experienced detection delay of over 30 days, and delay in initiating treatment of over 31 days. Consulting a non-TB health facility >= 3 times before seeking care at TB dispensary was a risk factor for both detection delay [AOR (95% CI): 1.89(1.07, 3.34) and delay in initiating treatment[AOR (95% CI): 1.88 (1.06, 3.36). Results revealed poor implementation of Directly Observed Therapy (DOT), whereby treatment of 34.3% patients was never monitored by HCWs. Only 31.8% patients had ever accessed TB health education before their TB diagnosis. Qualitative data consistently disclosed long patient delay, and indicated that patient's poor TB knowledge and socioeconomic barriers were primary reasons for patient delay. Seeking care and being treated at a non-TB hospital was an important reason for detection delay. Patient's long work hours and low income increased risk for treatment non-adherence. Evidence-based measures to improve TB health seeking behavior, reduce patient and detection delays, improve the quality of DOT, address financial and system barriers, and increase access to TB health promotion are urgently needed to address the burgeoning prevalence of MDR-TB in China.

10.1021_ac403281g	A Homogeneous Signal-On Strategy for the Detection of rpoB Genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Based on Electrochemiluminescent Graphene Oxide and Ferrocene Quenching	Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality all over the world and multidrug resistance TB (MDR-TB) pose a serious threat to the TB control and represent an increasing public health problem. In this work, we report a homogeneous signal-on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) DNA sensor for the sensitive and specific detection of rpoB genes of MDR-TB by using ruthenium(II) complex functionalized graphene oxide (Ru-GO) as suspension sensing interface and ferrocene-labeled ssDNA (Fc-ssDNA) as ECL intensity controller. The ECL of Ru-GO could be effectively quenched by Fc-ssDNA absorbed on the Ru-GO nanosheets. The Ru-GO has good discrimination ability over ssDNA and dsDNA. Mutant ssDNA target responsible for the drug resistant tuberculosis can hybridize with Fc-ssDNA and release Fc-ssDNA from Ru-GO surface, leading to the recovery of ECL. Mutant ssDNA target can be detected in a range from 0.1 to 100 nM with a detection limit of 0.04 nM. The proposed protocol is sensitive, specific, simple, time-saving and polymerase chain reaction free without complicated immobilization, separation and washing steps, which creates a simple but valuable tool for facilitating fast and accurate detection of disease related specific sequences or gene mutations.

10.1586_17476348.2014.856758	Common errors in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis management	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), defined as being resistant to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, has an increasing burden and threatens TB control. Diagnosis is limited and usually delayed while treatment is long lasting, toxic and poorly effective. MDR-TB management in scarce-resource settings is demanding however it is feasible and extremely necessary. In these settings, cure rates do not usually exceed 60-70% and MDR-TB management is novel for many TB programs. In this challenging scenario, both clinical and programmatic errors are likely to occur. The majority of these errors may be prevented or alleviated with appropriate and timely training in addition to uninterrupted procurement of high-quality drugs, updated national guidelines and laws and an overall improvement in management capacities. While new tools for diagnosis and shorter and less toxic treatment are not available in developing countries, MDR-TB management will remain complex in scarce resource settings. Focusing special attention on the common errors in diagnosis, regimen design and especially treatment delivery may benefit patients and programs with current outdated tools. The present article is a compilation of typical errors repeatedly observed by the authors in a wide range of countries during technical assistant missions and trainings.	clinical management; errors; extensively-drug resistance; multidrug resistance; tuberculosis; XDR	ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; PROGRAM CONDITIONS; MDR-TB; METAANALYSIS; RELIABILITY; DIAGNOSIS
10.1017_S0950268813001040	Seasonal dynamics of tuberculosis epidemics and implications for multidrug-resistant infection risk assessment	Understanding how seasonality shapes the dynamics of tuberculosis (TB) is essential in determining risks of transmission and drug resistance in (sub)tropical regions. We developed a relative fitness-based multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB model incorporated with seasonality and a probabilistic assessment model to assess infection risk in Taiwan regions. The model accurately captures the seasonal transmission and population dynamics of TB incidence during 2006-2008 and MDR TB in high TB burden areas during 2006-2010 in Taiwan. There is similar to 3% probability of having exceeded 50% of the population infected attributed to MDR TB. Our model not only provides insight into the understanding of the interactions between seasonal dynamics of TB and environmental factors but is also capable of predicting the seasonal patterns of TB incidence associated with MDR TB infection risk. A better understanding of the mechanisms of TB seasonality will be critical in predicting the impact of public control programmes.	transmission; Infection risk; seasonality; tuberculosis; modelling; multidrug-resistant	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; TAIWAN; STRATEGIES; EMERGENCE; FITNESS
10.1183_09031936.00079413	Costs of tuberculosis disease in the European Union: a systematic analysis and cost calculation	Without better vaccines it is unlikely that tuberculosis (TB) will ever be eliminated. An investment of similar to(sic)560 million is considered necessary to develop a new, effective vaccine in the European Union (EU). However, less is known about the costs of TB disease in the EU. We performed a systematic review of literature and institutional websites addressing the 27 EU members to summarise cost data. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane bibliographies for relevant articles. Combining direct and indirect costs, we arrived at an average per-TB case costs in the original EU-15 states plus Cyprus, Malta and Slovenia of (sic)10 282 for drug-susceptible TB, (sic)57 213 for multidrug resistant (MDR)-TB and (sic)170 744 for extensively drug resistant (XDR)-TB. In the remaining new EU states, costs amounted to (sic)3427 for drug-susceptible TB and (sic)24 166 for MDR-TB/XDR-TB. For the 70 340 susceptible TB cases, 1488 MDR-TB and 136 XDR-TB cases notified in 2011 costs of (sic)536 890 315 accumulated in 2012. In the same year, the 103 104 disability-adjusted life years caused by these cases, when stated in monetary terms, amounted to a total of (sic)5 361 408 000. Thus, the resulting economic burden of TB in the EU clearly outweighs the cost of investing in more efficient vaccines against TB.

10.1183_09031936.00005613	Comparing cost-effectiveness of standardised tuberculosis treatments given varying drug resistance	There is a growing need to identify appropriate standardised treatment strategies that will adequately treat various forms of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and prevent multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB. A Markov model estimated treatment-related acquired MDR-TB, mortality, disability-adjusted life years and costs in settings with different prevalence of isoniazid monoresistant TB and MDR-TB. We compared four treatment strategies: 1) the standard World Health Organization recommended treatment strategy; 2) adding ethambutol throughout the 6-month treatment of new cases; 3) using a strengthened standardised retreatment regimen; and 4) using standardised MDR treatment for failures of initial treatment. Treatment-related outcomes were derived from the published literature, and costs from direct surveys. A strengthened retreatment regimen, which could achieve lower failure, relapse and acquired MDR rates in isoniazid monoresistant cases, was predicted to be the most cost-effective strategy in all modelled settings. Empirical MDR treatment of failures of initial treatment was the most costly strategy but resulted in the fewest deaths. Adding ethambutol throughout initial treatment would be most effective in preventing acquired MDR, but would lead to excess cases of blindness. A high priority should be given to improving the standardised retreatment regimen, as this is predicted to produce greater benefits than other recently recommended strategies.

10.1128_AAC.01549_13	Plasma Drug Activity in Patients on Treatment for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Little is known about plasma drug concentrations relative to quantitative susceptibility in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). We previously described a TB drug activity (TDA) assay that determines the ratio of the time to detection of plasma-cocultured Mycobacterium tuberculosis versus control growth in a Bactec MGIT system. Here, we assess the activity of individual drugs in a typical MDR-TB regimen using the TDA assay. We also examined the relationship of the TDA to the drug concentration at 2 h (C-2) and the MICs among adults on a MDR-TB regimen in Tanzania. These parameters were also compared to the treatment outcome of sputum culture conversion. Individually, moxifloxacin yielded superior TDA results versus ofloxacin, and only moxifloxacin and amikacin yielded TDAs equivalent to a -2-log killing. In the 25 patients enrolled on a regimen of kanamycin, levofloxacin, ethionamide, pyrazinamide, and cycloserine, the C-2 values were found to be below the expected range for levofloxacin in 13 (52%) and kanamycin in 10 (40%). Three subjects with the lowest TDA result (<1.5, a finding indicative of poor killing) had significantly lower kanamycin C-2/MIC ratios than subjects with a TDA of >= 1.5 (9.8 +/- 8.7 versus 27.0 +/- 19.1; P = 0.04). The mean TDAs were 2.52 +/- 0.76 in subjects converting to negative in <= 2 months and 1.88 +/- 0.57 in subjects converting to negative in >2 months (P = 0.08). In Tanzania, MDR-TB drug concentrations were frequently low, and a wide concentration/ MIC range was observed that affected plasma drug activity ex vivo. An opportunity exists for pharmacokinetic optimization in current MDR-TB regimens, which may improve treatment response.

10.1016_j_ijantimicag.2013.10.010	Activity of linezolid-containing regimens against multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in mice	The objective of the present study was to compare the activities of regimens containing linezolid (LZD) with those not containing LZD against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in mice. The three regimens excluding LZD selected in this study are often used in practice against multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). When LZD was added to these MDR-TB regimens, the combinations were significantly more active after 2 months of therapy with regard to lung CFU reductions. The activity of LZD-containing regimens was greater than the World Health Organization's standard first-line regimen of rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide. In particular, when LZD was included in the combination levofloxacin + amikacin +para-aminosalicylic acid + pyrazinamide + clofazimine, culture negativity of the lungs was reached after 2 months of treatment in every case. In addition, the serum levels of interleukin-10 and interferon-gamma of mice were determined and were found not to be surrogate markers of bacterial clearance.

10.5588_ijtld.13.0627	Improved survival in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients receiving integrated tuberculosis and antiretroviral treatment in the SAPiT Trial	BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effects of antiretroviral treatment (ART) in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have not been established. OBJECTIVE: To assess therapeutic outcomes of integrating ART with treatment for MDR-TB. DESIGN: A subgroup of MDR-TB patients from a randomised controlled trial, the SAPiT (Starting Antiretroviral Therapy at Three Points in Tuberculosis) study, conducted in an out-patient clinic in Durban, South Africa, from 2008 to 2012. METHODS: Clinical outcomes at 18 months were compared in patients randomised to receive ART within 12 weeks of initiating standard first-line anti-tuberculosis treatment with those who commenced ART after completing anti-tuberculosis treatment. RESULTS: Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug susceptibility results were available in 489 (76%) of 642 SAPiT patients: 23 had MDR-TB, 14 in the integrated treatment arm and 9 in the sequential treatment arm. At 18 months, the mortality rate was 11.9/100 person-years (py; 95%CI 1.4-42.8) in the combined integrated treatment arm and 56.0/100 py (95%CI 18.2-130.8) in the sequential treatment arm (hazard ratio adjusted for baseline CD4 count and whether MDR-TB treatment was initiated: 0.14; 95%CI 0.02-0.94, P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Despite the small sample size, the 86% reduction in mortality due to early initiation of ART in MDR-TB patients was statistically significant.

10.5588_ijtld.13.0513	Stepwise implementation of a new diagnostic algorithm for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti	SETTING: The uptake of tests endorsed by the World Health Organization to detect and appropriately confirm multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in low-income countries remains insufficient. OBJECTIVE: To validate the implementation of line-probe assays (LPA) and liquid culture to develop an algorithm to detect MDR-TB in the challenging setting of Haiti. METHODS: Through an EXPAND-TB (Expanding Access to New Diagnostics for TB) partnership, proficiency testing and validation of 221 acid-fast bacilli positive specimens were performed. Sensitivity, cost and processing time were analysed. RESULTS: Using liquid vs. solid culture shortened the turnaround time from 54 to 19 days, with a sensitivity of 100% vs. 98.6% and a total cost reduction of 13%. LPA detected all TB and MDR-TB cases at a lower cost than culture, in a mean time of 7.5 days. CONCLUSION: The combined use of molecular and liquid culture techniques accelerates the accurate diagnosis of TB and susceptibility testing against first-line drugs in a significantly shorter time, and is less expensive. The implementation of this new algorithm could significantly and accurately improve the screening and treatment follow-up of patients affected with TB and MDR-TB.

10.5588_ijtld.13.0468	Performance of the MTBDRsl assay in Georgia	SETTING: The country of Georgia has a high burden of multi- (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). OBJECTIVE: To assess the performance of the Geno-Type (R) MTBDRsl assay in the detection of resistance to kanamycin (KM), capreomycin (CPM) and ofloxacin (OFX), and of XDR-TB. DESIGN: Consecutive acid-fast bacilli smear-positive sputum specimens identified as MDR-TB using the MTBDRplus test were evaluated with the MTBDRsl assay and conventional second-line drug susceptibility testing (DST). RESULTS: Among 159 specimens, amplification was adequate in 154 (97%), including 9 of 9 culture-negative and 2 of 3 contaminated specimens. Second-line DST revealed that 17 (12%) Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were XDR-TB. Compared to DST, the MTBDRsl had 41% sensitivity and 98% specificity in detecting XDR-TB and 81% sensitivity and 99% specificity in detecting OFX resistance. Sensitivity was low in detecting resistance to KM (29%) and CPM (57%), while specificity was respectively 99% and 94%. Median times from sputum collection to second-line DST and MTBDRsl results were 70-104 vs. 10 days. CONCLUSION: Although the MTBDRsl assay had a rapid turnaround time, detection of second-line drug resistance was poor compared to DST. Further genetic mutations associated with resistance to second-line drugs should be included in the assay to improve test performance and clinical utility.	line-probe assays; tuberculosis; drug resistance	DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; GENOTYPE MTBDRSL; ETHAMBUTOL RESISTANCE; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; DIAGNOSTIC-ACCURACY; CLINICAL-SAMPLES; 2ND-LINE; STRAINS; TIME
10.1371_journal.pone.0086225	Economic Support to Patients in HIV and TB Grants in Rounds 7 and 10 from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria	People with TB and/or HIV frequently experience severe economic barriers to health care, including out-of-pocket expenses related to diagnosis and treatment, as well as indirect costs due to loss of income. These barriers can both aggravate economic hardship and prevent or delay diagnosis, treatment and successful outcome, leading to increased transmission, morbidity and mortality. WHO, UNAIDS and the ILO argue that economic support of various kinds is essential to enable vulnerable people to protect themselves from infection, avoid delayed diagnosis and treatment, overcome barriers to adherence, and avert destitution. This paper analyses successful country proposals to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria that include economic support in Rounds 7 and 10; 36 and 20 HIV and TB grants in Round 7 and 32 and 26, respectively, in Round 10. Of these, up to 84 percent included direct or indirect economic support for beneficiaries, although the amount constituted a very small proportion of the total grant. In TB grants, the objectives of economic support were generally clearly stated, and focused on mechanisms to improve treatment uptake and adherence, and the case was most clearly made for MDR-TB patients. In HIV grants, the objectives were much broader in scope, including mitigation of adverse economic and social effects of HIV and its treatment on both patients and families. The analysis shows that economic support is on the radar for countries developing Global Fund proposals, and a wide range of economic support activities are in place. In order to move forward in this area, the wealth of country experience that exists needs to be collated, assessed and disseminated. In addition to trials, operational research and programme evaluations, more precise guidance to countries is needed to inform evidence-based decision about activities that are cost-effective, affordable and feasible.

10.1016_j.jpba.2013.09.014	Liquid chromatographic determination of CPZEN-45, a novel anti-tubercular drug, in biological samples	CPZEN-45 is a new drug candidate being considered for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). The aim of this study was to develop and validate a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method suitable to determine CPZEN-45 concentrations in biological samples. CPZEN-45 was extracted from biological fluids and tissues (plasma, lung and spleen from guinea pig) by sequential extraction with acetonitrile and quantified by a Waters HPLC Alliance System coupled with a ZORBAX Bonus-RP column, guard column and UV detection at 263 nm. The mobile phase was 20:80 acetonitrile:ultrapure-water with 0.05% TFA. The CPZEN-45 peak was eluted at 5.1 min with no interference from the inherent peaks of plasma, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), lung or spleen tissues. Recovery of CPZEN-45 from biological samples was >96% of the spiked amount. The limit of detection was 0.05 mu g/ml and the limit of quantitation was 0.29 mu g/ml which was more than 5 and 21 times lower than the reported minimal inhibitory concentration of CPZEN-45 (MIC = 1.56 mu g/ml for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 6.25 mu g/ml for MDR-TB, respectively). Thus, HPLC method was deemed reliable, sensitive, reproducible and accurate for the determination of CPZEN-45 concentrations in plasma, BAL, lung and spleen tissues. Therefore, this method was used in subsequent studies in the guinea pig model to determine the disposition of CPZEN-45 after administration of solutions by the IV and SC routes.

10.1186_1471_2458_14_46	The importance of providing counselling and financial support to patients receiving treatment for multi-drug resistant TB: mixed method qualitative and pilot intervention studies	Background: People with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in low-income countries face many problems during treatment, and cure rates are low. The purpose of the study was (a) to identify and document the problems experienced by people receiving care for MDR-TB, and how they cope when support is not provided, to inform development of strategies; (b) to estimate the effectiveness of two resultant strategies, counselling alone, and joint counselling and financial support, of increasing DOTS-plus treatment success under routine programme conditions. Methods: A mixed-method study comprising a formative qualitative study, pilot intervention study and explanatory qualitative study to better understand barriers to completion of treatment for MDR-TB. Participants were all people starting MDR-TB treatment in seven DOTS-plus centres in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal during January to December 2008. The primary outcome measure was cure, as internationally defined. Results: MDR-TB treatment caused extreme social, financial and employment hardship. Most patients had to move house and leave their job, and reported major stigmatisation. They were concerned about the long-term effects of their disease, and feared infecting others. In the resultant pilot intervention study, the two strategies appeared to improve treatment outcomes: cure rates for those receiving counselling, combined support and no support were 85%, 76% and 67% respectively. Compared with no support, the (adjusted) risk ratios of cure for those receiving counselling and receiving combined support were 1.2 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.6) and 1.2 (95% CI 0.9 to 1.6) respectively. The explanatory study demonstrated that patients valued both forms of support. Conclusions: MDR-TB patients are extremely vulnerable to stigma and extreme financial hardship. Provision of counselling and financial support may not only reduce their vulnerability, but also increase cure rates. National Tuberculosis Programmes should consider incorporating financial support and counselling into MDR-TB care: costs are low, and benefits high, especially since costs to society of incomplete treatment and potential for incurable TB are extremely high.

10.1186_1471_2334_14_11	Intensified specimen collection to improve tuberculosis diagnosis in children from Rural South Africa, an observational study	Background: In drug-resistant TB settings, specimen collection is critical for drug-susceptibility testing (DST). This observational study included multiple specimen types collected from pediatric TB suspects with the aim to determine diagnostic yield and inform clinical practice in children with drug-resistant and drug-susceptible TB. Methods: From 03/2009-07/2010, TB suspects aged >= 6 months and >= 12 years were recruited among outpatient and inpatient settings. Subjects were new TB suspects or had persistent symptoms despite >= 2 months of TB treatment. The protocol included collection of a single blood and urine specimen, a single sputum induction and, if inpatients and < 5 years of age, collection of 3 gastric aspirates (GA). Samples were cultured on solid and/or liquid media. DST was by 1% proportion method. Results: Among 118 children with possible, probable or confirmed TB, the mean age was 4.9 years [SD 3.2] and 64 (62%) of those tested were HIV-positive. Eight (7%) subjects were culture-positive from at least one specimen; yield did not differ by HIV status or TB treatment history. Among those with positive cultures, 7/8 (88%) were from induced sputum, 5/6 (83%) from GA, 3/8 (38%) from blood, and 3/7 (43%) from urine. In subjects with both induced sputum and GA collection, sputum provided one additional case compared to GA. Multidrug resistant (MDR)-TB was detected by urine culture alone in one child > 5 years old. Pan-resistant extensively drug resistant (XDR)-TB was identified by cultures from all sites in one subject. Conclusions: TB was cultured from HIV-positive and -negative children, and allowed for identification of MDR and XDR-TB cases. Urine and induced sputum each provided an additional TB diagnosis and, when compared to GA, may be considered a less invasive, same-day method of specimen collection for childhood TB suspects. This study illustrates the continued challenges and limitations of available strategies for pediatric TB diagnostics.

10.1371_journal.pone.0084197	Do We Need to Detect Isoniazid Resistance in Addition to Rifampicin Resistance in Diagnostic Tests for Tuberculosis?	"Background: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is resistant to both rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH). Whereas many TB diagnostics detect RIF-resistance, few detect INH-monoresistance, which is common and may increase risk of acquired MDR-TB. Whether inclusion of INH-resistance in a first-line rapid test for TB would have an important impact on MDR-TB rates remains uncertain. Methods: We developed a transmission model to evaluate three tests in a population similar to that of India: a rapid molecular test for TB, the same test plus RIF-resistance detection (""TB+RIF''), and detection of RIF and INH-resistance (""TB+RIF/INH''). Our primary outcome was the prevalence of INH-resistant and MDR-TB at ten years. Results: Compared to the TB test alone and assuming treatment of all diagnosed MDR cases, the TB+RIF test reduced the prevalence of MDR-TB among all TB cases from 5.5% to 3.8% (30.6% reduction, 95% uncertainty range, UR: 17-54%). Despite using liberal assumptions about the impact of INH-monoresistance on treatment outcomes and MDR-TB acquisition, expansion from TB+RIF to TB+RIF/INH lowered this prevalence only from 3.8% to 3.6% further (4% reduction, 95% UR: 3-7%) and INH-monoresistant TB from 15.8% to 15.1% (4% reduction, 95% UR: (-8)-19%). Conclusion: When added to a rapid test for TB plus RIF-resistance, detection of INH-resistance has minimal impact on transmission of TB, MDR-TB, and INH-monoresistant TB."

10.1159_000371869	French Nationwide Cohort Temporary Utilization Authorization Survey of GranuPAS (R) in MDR-TB Patients	Background: Para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) is again needed for the treatment of multidrug and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (M/XDR-TB). The study of a new granulated formulation (PAS-GR, 'GranuPAS (R)'), which might have fewer adverse events, was made possible by the statutory requirement that data be collected regarding its use in France in multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients under a 'therapeutic utilization' follow-up for safety and efficacy system called 'Autorisation Temporaire d'Utilisation' (ATU). Methods: In May 2011 an ATU cohort was established to monitor the named patient use of PAS-GR. All patients were included in a follow-up protocol developed by Lucane Pharma and the French Medicines Agency (ANSM) which recorded demographics, dosing characteristics, concomitant medications, adverse events, and outcome. Following EU marketing authorization, the ATU terminated about 3 years after initiation. Results: PAS-GR was used for the treatment of 231 MDR-TB patients. PAS-GR was used at 12 g/day in 114 cases and 8 g/day in 80 cases. PAS-GR-containing combinations resulted in sputum conversion in a median of 94 days (IQR 48-143) in the 55 patients with information after treatment initiation. Adverse effects of PAS-GR-containing combinations were mostly gastrointestinal (GI; 9% of patients experiencing a GI event at any time) and led to interrupt PAS-GR in 6% of cases (2.1% GI). Conclusions: The efficacy of PAS-GR appears equivalent to that of PAS, and its tolerance improved over earlier PAS formulations, thus supporting the use of PAS-GR as part of drug combinations for the treatment of MDR and XDR-TB.

10.3402_gha.v7.25382	Fifteen-year trend in treatment outcomes among patients with pulmonary smear-positive tuberculosis and its determinants in Arsi Zone, Central Ethiopia	Background: Directly Observed Treatment Short course (DOTS) strategy is aimed at diagnosing 70% of infectious tuberculosis (TB) and curing 85% of it. Arsi Zone of Ethiopia piloted DOTS strategy in 1992. Since then, the trend in treatment outcomes in general and at district-level in particular has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to analyse the trend in TB treatment outcomes and audit district-level treatment outcomes in the 25 districts of Arsi Zone. Design: A retrospective cohort study design was employed to audit pulmonary smear-positive (PTB+) patients registered between 1997 and 2011. Demographic and related data were collected from the TB unit registers between January and March 2013. The 15-year trend in treatment outcomes among PTB+ patients and district-level treatment outcomes was computed. Results: From 14,221 evaluated PTB+ cases, 11,888 (83.6%) were successfully treated. The treatment success rate (TSR) varied from 69.3 to 92.5%, defaulter rate from 2.5 to 21.6%, death rate from 1.6 to 11.1%, and failure rate from 0 to 3.6% across the 25 districts of the zone. The trend in TSR increased from 61 to 91% with the increase of population DOTS coverage from 18 to 70%. There was a declining trend in defaulter rate from 29.9 to 2.1% and death rate from 8.8 to 5.4% over 15 years. Patients aged 25-49 years (Adjusted Odd Ratio (AOR), 0.23; 95% CI: 0.21-0.26) and] 50 years (AOR, 0.43; 95% CI: 0.32-0.59), re-treatment cases (AOR, 0.61; 0.41, 0.67), and TB/HIV co-infection cases (AOR, 0.45; 95% CI: 0.31-0.53) were associated with unsuccessful treatment outcomes. Conclusions: DOTS expansion and improving population DOTS coverage in Arsi has led to a significant increase in treatment success and decrease in death and defaulter rates. However, there is a major variation in treatment outcomes across the 25 districts of the zone, so district-specific intervention strategy needs to be considered. The low TSR among re-treatment cases might be due to the high rate of MDR-TB among this group, and the issue needs to be further investigated to identify the extent of the problem.	tuberculosis; trends; treatment outcomes; Arsi Zone; Ethiopia	TREATMENT SUCCESS; SOUTHERN REGION; CONTROL PROGRAM; RISK-FACTORS; DOTS; COHORT; DISTRICTS; STATE
10.3402_gha.v7.24912	HIV, multidrug-resistant TB and depressive symptoms: when three conditions collide	Background: Management of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is highly challenging. Such patients are subject to long and potentially toxic treatments and may develop a number of different psychiatric illnesses such as anxiety and depressive disorders. A mental health assessment before MDR-TB treatment initiation may assist in early diagnosis and better management of psychiatric illnesses in patients already having two stigmatising and debilitating diseases. Objective: To address limited evidence on the baseline psychiatric conditions of HIV-infected MDR-TB patients, we aimed to document the levels of depressive symptoms at baseline, and any alteration following individualized clinical and psychological support during MDR-TB therapy, using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) tool, among HIV-infected patients. Design: This was a retrospective review of the medical records of an adult (aged > 15 years) HIV/MDR-TB cohort registered for care during the period of August 2012 through to March 2014. Results: A total of 45 HIV/MDR-TB patients underwent baseline assessment using the PHQ-9 tool, and seven (16%) were found to have depressive symptoms. Of these, four patients had moderate to severe depressive symptoms. Individualized psychological and clinical support was administered to these patients. Reassessments were carried out for all patients after 3 months of follow-up, except one, who died during the period. Among these 44 patients, three with baseline depressive symptoms still had depressive symptoms. However, improvements were observed in all but one after 3 months of follow-up. Conclusion: Psychiatric illnesses, including depressive symptoms, during MDR-TB treatment demand attention. Routine administration of baseline mental health assessments by trained staff has the potential to assist in determining appropriate measures for the management of depressive symptoms during MDR-TB treatment, and help in improving overall treatment outcomes. We recommend regular monitoring of mental health status by trained counsellors or clinical staff, using simple, validated and cost-effective tools.

10.3402_gha.v7.24593	Experiences in anti-tuberculosis treatment in patients with multiple previous treatments and its impact on drug resistant tuberculosis epidemics	Background: Tuberculosis (TB) patients with a history of multiple anti-TB treatments are the 'neglected' group to the free anti-TB treatment policy in China. Objective: To understand the experiences of TB patients with multiple previous treatments with regard to bacteriological diagnosis and treatment regimens, especially for second-line anti-TB drugs, and how this might influence the risks of multidrug and extensively drug-resistant TB (M/XDR-TB). Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 10 county/district TB clinics in five provinces of China. The study participants were TB patients that had at least two previous treatment episodes that lasted longer than 1 month each. Face-to-face interviews and drug susceptibility testing (DST) were conducted with the consenting participants. Results: A total of 328 TB patients were recruited. The proportion of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) was 58.2% in the 287 DST-confirmed patients. Forty-two percent of the patients did not complete their first treatment course. About 23.8% of the participants had a history of taking second-line drugs, and more than 77.8% of them were treated in county TB dispensaries where only sputum microscopy was applied. Multivariate analysis found that the use of second-line drugs was significantly associated with frequency of previous treatments (p<0.01), but not with drug resistance profiles of patients. Conclusions: Patients with multiple previous treatments are at extremely high risk of MDR-TB in China. The unregulated use of second-line drugs bring about the threat of XDR-TB epidemic. DST-guided treatment and strict regulations of anti-TB treatment should be assured for the high-risk TB patients for the prevention and control of M/XDR-TB.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs; treatment history; China	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; NATIONAL-SURVEY; 2ND-LINE DRUGS; RURAL CHINA; SUSCEPTIBILITY; MANAGEMENT; ADHERENCE; DOTS
10.2169_internalmedicine.53.2145	Esophagomediastinal Fistula Secondary to Multidrug-resistant Tuberculous Mediastinal Lymphadenitis	Esophagomediastinal fistula secondary to mediastinal tuberculosis (TB) lymphadenitis is a rare and unusual complication. A 32-year-old woman visited our clinic because of chest pain. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an esophagomediastinal fistula with subcarinal lymphadenopathy and no remarkable parenchymal lung lesions. The esophagomediastinal fistula was confirmed by esophagoscopy; however, the patient's bronchoscopy findings were unremarkable. The endobronchial ultrasound-guided lymph node aspiration did not confirm a diagnosis of TB. Finally, the patient was diagnosed via a lymph node biopsy. A drug-sensitivity test revealed the presence of a multidrug-resistant pathogen. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of esophagomediastinal fistula secondary to multidrug-resistant (MDR-) TB mediastinal lymphadenitis.	mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenitis; esophagomediastinal fistula; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION; ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUG-RESISTANCE; EXTRA-PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; GAMMA RELEASE ASSAY; LYMPHADENOPATHY; DIAGNOSIS; COMPLICATION; ADULTS; EPIDEMIOLOGY
pub-0876	DFT Based QSAR/QSPR Models in the Development of Novel Anti-tuberculosis Drugs Targeting Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an infectious bacterial disease which is a leading cause of mortality affecting more than 9 million people worldwide. The current standard regimens that are available for the treatment of TB are severely hampered due to the occurrence of multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR-TB) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In the past few years, a huge and constantly expanding effort has been developed to understand the chemical-biological interaction of many new anti-tubercular drugs and their targets in mathematical terms.

10.1136_bmjopen_2013_004143	Safety and availability of clofazimine in the treatment of multidrug and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis: analysis of published guidance and meta-analysis of cohort studies	Objectives: Given the spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), new therapies are urgently needed, including the repurposing of existing drugs. We aimed to assess key considerations for the clinical and programmatic use of clofazimine (Cfz), a riminophenazine with antimycobacterial activity currently used to treat leprosy. Design: Fixed and random effects meta-analysis of cohort studies and systematic review. Setting: Electronic and manual searches were combined. Inclusion criteria: Observational studies on treatment of multidrug-resistant and extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis with Cfz or a Cfz-containing regimen, and published guidance and documents relating to cost and availability were eligible. Results: 5 observational studies enrolled 861 patients, of which 602 received Cfz. The pooled proportion of adverse drug reactions requiring discontinuation of Cfz treatment was 0.1% (95% CI (0.0 to 0.6%)), and the median frequency of all adverse events was 5.1%. Cfz showed in vitro efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Cfz-containing regimens may have had a useful role in the treatment of patients with drug-resistant strains and who had limited alternative treatment options. However, Cfz uptake remains insufficient to meet global needs; there is only one internationally quality-assured manufacturer, which produces a limited quantity of the drug prioritised for treatment of leprosy, the only indication for which the drug is registered. Conclusions: While the data were limited, Cfz was associated with a risk for adverse drug reactions comparable to that of first-line TB treatment, which could be reasonably managed under programmatic conditions. However, low market availability and high cost are important barriers to access to Cfz for patients with MDR-TB.

10.3402_gha.v7.24022	Is resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus? A register review in Beijing, China	Background: China has a high burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Objective: The objectives of this study were to determine the following in patients with culture-confirmed TB: 1) demographic characteristics and disease patterns in relation to the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes and 2) presence or absence of drug resistance to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP) or both in relation to duration of diabetes and control of diabetes. Design: This is a cross-sectional and retrospective study involving record reviews. Results: There were 621 patients with culture-positive TB, of whom 187 (30%) had previously known or new type 2 diabetes. In those with diabetes, there was a significantly higher proportion of males, persons aged >= 35 years and patients registered with new TB (p<0.05). Prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was 6.2% in new patients (N = 422) and 62.3% in previously treated patients (N = 199), with no significant differences between those with and without diabetes. In patients with diabetes, there was no association of drug resistance with diabetes duration or disease control [assessed by fasting blood glucose (FBG) at 1 week]. Conclusion: A high proportion of patients with TB in a tertiary health facility, Beijing, China, had diabetes, but there was no association between type 2 diabetes and drug-resistant TB. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.	diabetes mellitus; diabetes duration; diabetes control; tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; China	TUBERCULOSIS TREATMENT; PREVALENCE; OUTCOMES; SMOKING; IMPACT; RISK
10.1155_2014_689852	A Systematic Follow-Up of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Drug-Resistance and Associated Genotypic Lineages in the French Departments of the Americas over a Seventeen-Year Period	The population of the French Departments of the Americas (FDA) is highly influenced by the intense migratory flows with mainland France and surrounding countries of the Caribbean and Latin America, some of which have high incidence rates of tuberculosis (Haiti: 230/100,000; Guyana: 111/100,000; and Suriname: 145/100,000) and drug resistance. Since the development of drug resistance to conventional antituberculous drugs has a major impact on the treatment success of tuberculosis, we therefore decided to review carefully Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance and associated genotypic lineages in the FDA over a seventeen-year period (January 1995-December 2011). A total of 1239 cases were studied, including 153 drug-resistant and 26 multidrug-resistant- (MDR-) TB cases, representing 12.3% and 2.1% of the TB cases in our study setting. A significantly higher proportion of M. tuberculosis isolates among relapse cases showed drug resistance to isoniazid (22.5%, P = 0.002), rifampicin (20.0%, P < 0.001), or both (MDR-TB, 17.5%; P < 0.001). Determination of spoligotyping based phylogenetic clades showed that among the five major lineages observed-T family (30.1%); Latin-American and Mediterranean (LAM, 23.7%); Haarlem (H, 22.2%); East-African Indian (EAI, 7.2%); and X family (6.5%)-two lineages, X and LAM, were overrepresented in drug-resistant and MDR-TB cases, respectively. Finally, 19 predominant spoligotypes were identified for the 1239 isolates of M. tuberculosis in our study among which 4 were significantly associated with drug resistance corresponding to SIT20/LAM1, SIT64/LAM6, SIT45/H1, and SIT46/undefined lineage.

10.7196_SAMJ.6455	Prevalence and incidence of symmetrical symptomatic peripheral neuropathy in patients with multidrug-resistant TB	Background. Symptomatic symmetrical peripheral neuropathy (SSPN) is common in patients with HIV infection. It is also a common adverse-event associated with both tuberculosis (TB) treatment and antiretroviral therapy (ART), particularly stavudine. While tenofovir is the One Of recommended first line nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors(NRTIs); there is a risk of nephrotoxicity when Using tenofovir together with the aminoglycosides needed to treat multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. Thus, stavudine is often chosen as a treatment option for the HIV-infected MDR TB patient. Objective. TO assess Whether use of stavudine both before and during treatment for MDR TB increased the prevalence and incidence of SSPN. Method: MDR TB patients at Sizwe tropical Disease Hospital were examined for signs of prevalent SSPN: Age, gender, HIV Status, alcohol use TB and HIV treatment regimens both prior to admission and Current and concomitant medications were recorded. Results. In this cohort of 246 patients, we found that 24.4% of patients With MDR TB had SSPN at time of admission for treatment of MDR I TB. They were More likely to be HIV-infected (odds ratio (OR) 3.21; 95% CI 1.25 - 8.21) and tended to have longer (>7 months) exposure to stavudine (OR 1.81; 95% CI 0.90 - 3.63). Incident SSPN occurred in 17% of patients and was associated with older age (hazard ratio (HR) 3.00; 95% CI 1.30 - 6.89) and exposure to terizidone (HR 2.98; 95% CI 0.94 to 4.61) or to a lesser extent with stavudine (crude HR 1.62; 95% CI 0.65 - 4.01) in the first 6 mouths of MDR TB treatment. This common adverse event emphasises the need for the development of less toxic drugs for the treatment of MDR TB.		NEPHROTOXICITY; HIV

Because development of RMR-TB is not common, we also identified the major risk factors associated with RMR-TB reported from different provinces of Iran. Data for 3,020 TB patients who remained or became smear positive after two, four, six, and nine months of standard first-line chemotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. Of 3,020 patients, 1,242 patients (41.1%) were culture and DNA positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Of these patients, 73 (7.4%) patients had monoresistant isolates to rifampin, which was significantly higher than that for multidrug-resistant TB (5.8%). The average rate of RMR-TB in the studied population ranged from 5% to 10%. Classical investigation showed that 33.6% of patients had either a previous or family history of TB. Molecular epidemiology methods (i.e., spoligotyping and Mycobacterium intespersed repetitive unit variable number tandem repeat), defined transmission link in three clusters (13%). These results outline the urgent need for a comprehensive plan for detection and treatment of RMR-TB cases.

10.5588_ijtld.13.0307	Treatment outcomes and moxifloxacin susceptibility in ofloxacin-resistant multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: A tertiary referral centre in Seoul, South Korea. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of moxifloxacin (MFX) susceptibility and later-generation fluoroquinolone (FQ) use on the treatment outcomes of ofloxacin (OFX) resistant multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). DESIGN: Of 223 patients diagnosed with MDR-TB between January 2006 and December 2012, 70 (31.4%) patients with OFX-resistant MDR-TB were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Their treatment outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: The mean age (standard deviation) of the 70 patients was 40.6 (12.9) years; 43 (61.4%) were male and 26 (37.1%) had extensively drug-resistant TB. Of the 70 patients, 22 (31.4%) had MFX-susceptible TB, while the remaining 48 (68.6%) were MFX-resistant. The MFX-susceptible and -resistant groups were comparable in terms of baseline characteristics (including age, sex and radiological severity), and respectively 90.9% (20/22) and 70.8% (34/48) were treated with later-generation FQ-containing regimens (P = 0.074; mainly MFX [40/54, 74.1%]). Treatment success was achieved in 72.7% (16/22) of the MFX-susceptible patients and in 41.7% (20/48) of the MFX-resistant patients (P = 0.021). Treatment failure was significantly higher in the MFX-resistant group (41.7% [20/48] vs. 9.1% [2/22]; P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Patients with OFX-resistant MDR-TB had significantly better treatment outcomes when susceptible to MFX. This probably reflects the effect of later-generation FQ treatment.	later-generation fluoroquinolone; ofloxacin; multidrug-resistant TB	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; FLUOROQUINOLONE RESISTANCE; SURVIVAL
10.1007_s00044_013_0645_x	Pharmacophore combination as a useful strategy to discover new antitubercular agents	The present study is aimed at combining two well-known pharmacophores (pyrazoline and benzoxazole nucleus) to design and synthesize a series of substituted pyrazoline-based benzoxazole derivatives. In vitro antitubercular evaluation against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) strains showed that most of the target compounds displayed potent activity (MIC similar to 1.25-25 mu g/mL) where few compounds were found to be better than isoniazid against MDR-TB (MIC = 3.25 mu g/mL) and XDR-TB (MIC = 12.5 mu g/mL). Cytotoxicity assay of these active compounds in VERO cell lines displayed good selectivity index. In order to gain insights into the plausible binding motifs, the target compounds were docked into enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, a molecular target of isoniazid. All the docked compounds occupied the same hydrophobic binding pocket and interacted mostly by dispersion interactions. Contribution of the three pharmacophoric fragments (pyrazoline, benzoxazole and aryl ring) toward protein-ligand binding was evaluated at semi empirical quantum mechanics level. The interaction energies suggested that most of the binding was governed by the benzoxaxole moiety followed by pyrazoline and aryl rings.

10.3201_eid2001.130732	Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in High-Risk Groups, Zimbabwe	To estimate prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) in Harare, Zimbabwe, in 2012, we performed microbiologic testing on acid-fast bacilli smear-positive sputum samples from patients previously treated for TB. Twenty (24%) of 84 specimens were consistent with MDR TB. A national drug-resistance survey is needed to determine MDR TB prevalence in Zimbabwe.		
10.1016_j.tube.2013.10.006	Pyrazinamide susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by high resolution melt analysis	Pyrazinamide (PZA) plays the important role in shortening the tuberculosis treatment period and in treating MDR-TB. Phenotypic PZA susceptibility methods are limited because they require specialized acidified media, which increases costs and complexity. In this study we developed a genotypic high resolution melt (HRM) analysis technique to detect pncA mutations associated with PZA resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Seven overlapping primer pairs were designed to cover the entire pncA gene and upstream regions. Each gene segment was individually amplified by real-time PCR followed by HRM analysis. The assay was evaluated on 98 clinical M. tuberculosis isolates (41 PZA susceptible by MGIT method, 55 PZA resistant, 2 undetermined). HRM was 94% concordant to full-length sequencing results, with most discrepancies attributable to mixed populations per HRM or transversions. Sequencing and HRM yielded 82% and 84% concordance, respectively, to phenotypic PZA susceptibilities by MGIT, with most discrepancies attributable to isolates with wild-type pncA but phenotypic PZA resistance. This HRM technique is a simple and high-throughput method for screening clinical M. tuberculosis samples for PZA resistance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.1016_j.tube.2013.10.001	High degree of multi-drug resistance and hetero-resistance in pulmonary TB patients from Punjab state of India	"Line Probe Assays (LPAs) have been recommended for rapid screening of MDR-TB. Aims of this study were (1) to compare the performance of LPA with standard Bactec MGIT 960 system and (2) to ascertain the pattern of genetic mutations in the resistance isolates. In phase I, a total of 141 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from our routine laboratory were tested by LPA and Bactec MGIT 960 for DST. In phase II, 578 sputum specimens of suspected DR-TB patients were received from the Punjab state of India. Of them 438 specimens or their cultures were subjected to LPA. The presence of mutant bands with their corresponding wild type band was identified as ""hetero-resistance"". In phase I, LPA showed high concordance with 96.4% positive agreement and 97.6% negative agreement with Bactec MGIT 960-DST. In phase II, 12 (2.7%) specimens were detected as invalid by LPA. Of the remaining 426 specimens, 184 (43.1%) had resistance to RIF and 142 (33.3%) to INH while 103 (24.1%) specimens showed resistance to both INH and RIF (MDR-TB) by LPA. Of the 142 INH resistant, 113 (79.5%) showed mutations in katG and 29 (20.4%) in inhA. A high rate of hetero-resistance pattern was observed in rpoB gene (28.8%) and katG gene (9.8%). The most frequent mutation was S531L (81.1%) in rpoB region and S315T1 (100%) in katG gene. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

10.1128_AAC.01478_13	Moxifloxacin Population Pharmacokinetics and Model-Based Comparison of Efficacy between Moxifloxacin and Ofloxacin in African Patients	Pharmacokinetic exposure and the MIC of fluoroquinolones are important determinants of their efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Population modeling was used to describe the steady-state plasma pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in 241 tuberculosis (TB) patients in southern Africa. Monte Carlo simulations were applied to obtain the area under the unbound concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (fAUC(0-24)) after daily doses of 400 mg or 800 mg moxifloxacin and 800 mg ofloxacin. The MIC distributions of ofloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined for 197 drug-resistant clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. For a specific MIC, the probability of target attainment (PTA) was determined for target fAUC(0-24)/MIC ratios of >= 53 and >= 100. The PTAs were combined with the MIC distributions to calculate the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) for multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Even with the less stringent target ratio of >= 53, moxifloxacin at 400 mg and ofloxacin at 800 mg achieved CFRs of only 84% and 58% for multidrug-resistant isolates with resistance to an injectable drug, while the 800-mg moxifloxacin dose achieved a CFR of 98%. Using a target ratio of >= 100 for multidrug-resistant strains (without resistance to injectable agents or fluoroquinolones), the CFR was 88% for moxifloxacin and only 43% for ofloxacin, and the higher dose of 800 mg moxifloxacin was needed to achieve a CFR target of >90%. Our results indicate that moxifloxacin is more efficacious than ofloxacin in the treatment of MDR-TB. Further studies should determine the optimal pharmacodynamic target for moxifloxacin in a multidrug regimen and clarify safety issues when it is administered at higher doses.

pub-0889	QSAR Based Design of New Antitubercular Compounds: Improved Isoniazid Derivatives Against Multidrug-Resistant TB	Tuberculosis (TB) is the second cause of death from a single infectious agent, the M. tuberculosis bacillus. Nearly two billion people are infected and about 8.7 million new cases and 1.4 million deaths were reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2013. Despite the availability of effective treatment, the alarming emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains (with 310.000 estimated cases in 2011 among notified patients with pulmonary TB), simultaneously resistant to the two most effective anti-TB drugs, isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin, has urged the need to develop new molecular scaffolds, either structurally original or based on old and active drugs. The aim of this review is to summarize the current status of different QSAR based strategies for the design of novel anti-TB drugs based upon the most active anti-TB agent known, INH. A case study puts in evidence that the judicious application of quantitative structure-activity relationships can be successfully used to rationally design new INH-based derivatives, active against INH-resistant strains harboring mutations in the most frequent resistance related target (katG), and therefore develop candidate-compounds against MDR-TB, thus revisiting the unique effectiveness of INH against TB.

More than four decades after one U.S. Surgeon General reportedly declared it time to close the book on infectious diseases, drug-resistant pathogens have diminished the effectiveness of once-potent therapies.(1) In the past three decades, newly described pathogens, including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, and the H1N1 influenza virus, have caused pandemics, while old scourges from tuberculosis to cholera have persisted or resurged. Simultaneously, rising life expectancy and rapid social change have led to an increasing burden of chronic diseases for which we have effective therapies but inadequate innovation for delivering them efficiently to ...

10.1371_journal.pone.0082809	Morphological Characterization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a MODS Culture for an Automatic Diagnostics through Pattern Recognition	Tuberculosis control efforts are hampered by a mismatch in diagnostic technology: modern optimal diagnostic tests are least available in poor areas where they are needed most. Lack of adequate early diagnostics and MDR detection is a critical problem in control efforts. The Microscopic Observation Drug Susceptibility (MODS) assay uses visual recognition of cording patterns from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) to diagnose tuberculosis infection and drug susceptibility directly from a sputum sample in 7-10 days with a low cost. An important limitation that laboratories in the developing world face in MODS implementation is the presence of permanent technical staff with expertise in reading MODS. We developed a pattern recognition algorithm to automatically interpret MODS results from digital images. The algorithm using image processing, feature extraction and pattern recognition determined geometrical and illumination features used in an object-model and a photo-model to classify TB-positive images. 765 MODS digital photos were processed. The single-object model identified MTB (96.9% sensitivity and 96.3% specificity) and was able to discriminate non-tuberculous mycobacteria with a high specificity (97.1% M. avium, 99.1% M. chelonae, and 93.8% M. kansasii). The photo model identified TB-positive samples with 99.1% sensitivity and 99.7% specificity. This algorithm is a valuable tool that will enable automatic remote diagnosis using Internet or cellphone telephony. The use of this algorithm and its further implementation in a telediagnostics platform will contribute to both faster TB detection and MDR TB determination leading to an earlier initiation of appropriate treatment.

10.1186_1471_2458_13_1171	Rates and risk factors for drug resistance tuberculosis in Northeastern China	Background: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) has emerged as a major challenge toward TB control and prevention. In Lianyungang city, the extent and trend of drug resistant TB is not well known. The objective of the survey was to assess drug resistance pattern of MTB and risk factors for drug resistant TB, including multidrug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in this area. Methods: We performed drug susceptibility testing on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates with first-and second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs of 1012 culture positive TB cases by using the proportion method, who were consecutively enrolled from January 2011 to December 2012 in Lianyungang city, China. The patterns of drug resistance in MTB were investigated and multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the risk factors for drug resistant TB. Results: Among the 1012 strains tested, 308 (30.4%) strains were resistant to at least one first-line drug; the prevalence of MDR-TB was 88 (8.7%), 5 (0.5%) strains were found to be extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). Female gender was a risk factor for MDR-TB (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.763, 95% CI (1.060-2.934). The aged 28-54 years was significantly associated with the risk of MDR-TB with an aOR: 2.224, 95% CI (1.158-4.273) when compared with those 65 years or older. Patients with previous treatment history had a more than 7-fold increased risk of MDR-TB, compared with those never previously treated. Conclusions: The burden of drug resistant TB cases is sizeable, which highlights an urgent need to reinforce control, detection and treatment strategies for drug resistant TB.

10.1371_journal.pone.0083480	Alcohol, Hospital Discharge, and Socioeconomic Risk Factors for Default from Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment in Rural South Africa: A Retrospective Cohort Study	Background: Default from multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment remains a major barrier to cure and epidemic control. We sought to identify patient risk factors for default from MDR-TB treatment and high-risk time periods for default in relation to hospitalization and transition to outpatient care. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 225 patients who initiated MDR-TB treatment between 2007 through 2010 at a rural TB hospital in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Results: Fifty percent of patients were cured or completed treatment, 27% defaulted, 14% died, 4% failed treatment, and 5% transferred out. Recent alcohol use was common (63% of patients). In multivariable proportional hazards regression, older age (hazard ratio [HR]= 0.97 [95% confidence interval 0.94-0.99] per year of greater age), formal housing (HR=0.38 [0.19-0.78]), and steady employment (HR= 0.41 [0.19-0.90]) were associated with decreased risk of default, while recent alcohol use (HR= 2.1 [1.1-4.0]), recent drug use (HR= 2.0 [1.0-3.6]), and Coloured (mixed ancestry) ethnicity (HR= 2.3 [1.1-5.0]) were associated with increased risk of default (P< 0.05). Defaults occurred throughout the first 18 months of the two-year treatment course but were especially frequent among alcohol users after discharge from the initial four-to-five-month in-hospital phase of treatment, with the highest default rates occurring among alcohol users within two months of discharge. Default rates during the first two months after discharge were also elevated for patients who received care from mobile clinics. Conclusions: Among patients who were not cured or did not complete MDR-TB treatment, the majority defaulted from treatment. Younger, economically-unstable patients and alcohol and drug users were particularly at risk. For alcohol users as well as mobile-clinic patients, the early outpatient treatment phase is a high-risk period for default that could be targeted in efforts to increase treatment completion rates.

10.1371_journal.pone.0083012	Elucidating Emergence and Transmission of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Treatment Experienced Patients by Whole Genome Sequencing	Background: Understanding the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is crucial for its control. MDR-TB in previously treated patients is generally attributed to the selection of drug resistant mutants during inadequate therapy rather than transmission of a resistant strain. Traditional genotyping methods are not sufficient to distinguish strains in populations with a high burden of tuberculosis and it has previously been difficult to assess the degree of transmission in these settings. We have used whole genome analysis to investigate M. tuberculosis strains isolated from treatment experienced patients with MDR-TB in Uganda over a period of four years. Methods and Findings: We used high throughput genome sequencing technology to investigate small polymorphisms and large deletions in 51 Mycobacterium tuberculosis samples from 41 treatment-experienced TB patients attending a TB referral and treatment clinic in Kampala. This was a convenience sample representing 69% of MDR-TB cases identified over the four year period. Low polymorphism was observed in longitudinal samples from individual patients (2-15 SNPs). Clusters of samples with less than 50 SNPs variation were examined. Three clusters comprising a total of 8 patients were found with almost identical genetic profiles, including mutations predictive for resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid, suggesting transmission of MDR-TB. Two patients with previous drug susceptible disease were found to have acquired MDR strains, one of which shared its genotype with an isolate from another patient in the cohort. Conclusions: Whole genome sequence analysis identified MDR-TB strains that were shared by more than one patient. The transmission of multidrug-resistant disease in this cohort of retreatment patients emphasises the importance of early detection and need for infection control. Consideration should be given to rapid testing for drug resistance in patients undergoing treatment to monitor the emergence of resistance and permit early intervention to avoid onward transmission.

Treatment of MDR-TB patients is long and less effective, resulting in a significant number of treatment failures. The development of further resistances leads to extensively drug-resistant (XDR) variants. However, data on the individual reasons for treatment failure, e.g. an induced mutational burst, and on the evolution of bacteria in the patient are only sparsely available. To address this question, we investigated the intra-patient evolution of serial MTBC isolates obtained from three MDR-TB patients undergoing longitudinal treatment, finally leading to XDR-TB. Sequential isolates displayed identical IS6110 fingerprint patterns, suggesting the absence of exogenous re-infection. We utilized whole genome sequencing (WGS) to screen for variations in three isolates from Patient A and four isolates from Patient B and C, respectively. Acquired polymorphisms were subsequently validated in up to 15 serial isolates by Sanger sequencing. We determined eight (Patient A) and nine (Patient B) polymorphisms, which occurred in a stepwise manner during the course of the therapy and were linked to resistance or a potential compensatory mechanism. For both patients, our analysis revealed the long-term co-existence of clonal subpopulations that displayed different drug resistance allele combinations. Out of these, the most resistant clone was fixed in the population. In contrast, baseline and follow-up isolates of Patient C were distinguished each by eleven unique polymorphisms, indicating an exogenous re-infection with an XDR strain not detected by IS6110 RFLP typing. Our study demonstrates that intra-patient microevolution of MDR-MTBC strains under longitudinal treatment is more complex than previously anticipated. However, a mutator phenotype was not detected. The presence of different subpopulations might confound phenotypic and molecular drug resistance tests. Furthermore, high resolution WGS analysis is necessary to accurately detect exogenous re-infection as classical genotyping lacks discriminatory power in high incidence settings.

10.1371_journal.pone.0082943	Risk Factors for Poor Treatment Outcomes in Patients with MDR-TB and XDR-TB in China: Retrospective Multi-Center Investigation	Background: The treatment of patients with MDR- and XDR-TB is usually more complex, toxic and costly and less effective than treatment of other forms of TB. However, there is little information available on risk factors for poor outcomes in patients with MDR- and XDR-TB in China. Methodology/Principal Findings: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical records of HIV-negative TB Patients with culture-proven MDR- or XDR-TB who were registered from July 2006 to June 2011 at five large-scale Tuberculosis Specialized Hospitals in China. Among 1662 HIV-seronegative TB cases which were culture-positive for M. tuberculosis complex and had positive sputum-smear microscopy results, 965 cases (58.1%) were DR-TB, and 586 cases (35.3%) were classified as having MDR-TB, accounting for 60.7% of DR-TB. 169 cases (10.2%) were XDR-TB, accounting for 17.5% of DR-TB, 28.8% of MDR-TB. The MDR-TB patients were divided into XDR-TB group (n=169) and other MDR-TB group (non-XDR MDR-TB) (n=417). In total, 240 patients (40.95%) had treatment success, and 346 (59.05%) had poor treatment outcomes. The treatment success rate in other MDR-TB group was 52.2%, significantly higher than that in the XDR-TB group (13%, P<0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, poor outcomes were associated with duration of previous anti-TB treatment of more than one year (OR, 0.077; 95% CI, 0.011-0.499, P<0.001), a BMI less than 18.5 kg/m(2) (OR, 2.185; 95% CI, 1.372-3.478, P<0.001), XDR (OR, 13.368; 95% CI, 6.745-26.497, P<0.001), retreatment (OR, 0.171; 95% CI, 0.093-0.314, P<0.001), diabetes (OR, 0.305; 95% CI, 0.140-0.663, P=0.003), tumor (OR, 0.095; 95% CI, 0.011-0.795, P=0.03), decreased albumin (OR, 0.181; 95% CI, 0.118-0.295, P<0.001), cavitation (OR, 0.175; 95% CI, 0.108-0.286, P<0.001). Conclusions/Significance: The patients with MDR-TB and XDR-TB have poor treatment outcomes in China. The presence of extensive drug resistance, low BMI, hypoalbuminemia, comorbidity, cavitary disease and previous anti-TB treatment are independent prognostic factors for poor outcome in patients with MDR-TB.

10.1002_mbo3.139	Spoligotyping and drug resistance patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from five provinces of Iran	Tuberculosis (TB) persists as a public health problem in Iran. Characterization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates circulating in this area will contribute to understand and control the spread of the strains. The aims of this study were to understand the genetic diversity and drug susceptibility of M. tuberculosis isolates circulating in Iran and to analyze the relationship between genotype and drug resistance. A total of 291 M. tuberculosis isolates collected from TB patients were genotyped by spoligotyping. Drug susceptibility testing was performed using proportion method. Spoligotyping resulted in 75 distinct patterns. 86.2% of isolates were grouped in 35 clusters while the remaining isolates were unique. Ural was found to be the most predominant lineage (34.3%) followed by Central Asian strain (CAS) (24%), T (18.2%), Manu2 (7.5%) and Latin American-Mediterranean (LAM) (6.1%). The five largest clusters were Ural/Spoligotype International Type (SIT) 127 (15.8%), CAS1/SIT26 (9.2%), T1/SIT53 (6.1%), T1/SIT284 (5.4%), and CAS1/SIT25 (4.4%). About 5% of isolates had multidrug resistance (MDR) and 10% had other resistance. MDR was significantly associated with Beijing strains, but not with Ural family. This study highlights dominance of Ural, CAS, and T families in Iran. Biogeographic specificity of CAS and T families to border provinces of Iran including Sistan-Baluchestan and Kermanshah, respectively, suggested that this family strains might be transmitted from these regions to other provinces of the country.

10.1016_j.ejmech.2013.10.044	Co(II) and Cu(II) pyrophosphate complexes have selectivity and potency against Mycobacteria including Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Tuberculosis (TB) causes up to 10 million incident cases worldwide per annum. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains are leading factors in the resurgence of TB cases and the need to produce new agents to combat such infection. Herein, we describe Co(II) and Cu(II) metal based complexes that feature the pyrophosphate ligand with notable selectivity and marked potency against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including MDR strains. Such complexes are confirmed to be bacteriocidal and not affected by efflux inhibitors. Finally, while susceptibility to copper has recently been established for M. tuberculosis, the greater efficacy of cobalt observed herein is of considerable note and in line with the discovery of a copper metallothionein in M. tuberculosis.

10.1016_j.pneumo.2013.08.002	Evaluation of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment in Ivory Coast from 2008 to 2010	This is a retrospective study conducted from January 2008 to December 2010 on sectional descriptive analysis of records of patients treated for MDR-TB and whose follow-up was in the thoracic department of Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) of Cocody in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire. We selected eight patients who met the inclusion criteria of 21 MDR-TB patients registered during the study period. The average age was 29.25 years ranging from 21 to 39. Males accounted for 75% of the patients (6 males and 2 females). The students represented the professional social layer most affected with 37.5% of the patients. All patients had a history of tuberculosis and only one patient was HIV positive under anti-retroviral (zidovudin, lamivudin and efavirenz). All cultures found Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The resistance profile in addition to isoniazid and rifampicin, found two cases of resistance to ethambutol and streptomycin. The chest radiograph at the time of initiation of second-line treatment showed essentially excavations in 75% of cases and infiltrates in 25%. The lesions were bilateral in 7 of 8 patients (87.5%). The main side effects observed during treatment were limited to cochleovestibular disorders (2 patients) and neuropsychiatric disorders (2 patients) and digestive disorders in half of the patients with removal of the offending molecule kanamycin. After 24 months of treatment, it was numbered five cures (62.5%), two failures and one death. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

10.1016_j.pneumo.2013.09.002	Role of pulmonary resections in management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. A monocentric series of 29 patients	Introduction. - Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a worldwide health problem. Surgery is often used as an adjuvent therapy with anti-tuberculosis agents. The aim of this study is to present our results of pulmonary resections in the treatment of MDR-TB. Materiel and methods. - This is a retrospective nnonocentric study of 29 patients operated on between 1995 and 2010 for MDR-TB. Results. - Tuberculosis was evolving from 9 to 108 months with a median of 34.77 +/- 19.88 months. The average number of tuberculosis relapses was 2.73 per patient. All patients had a destroyed and/or cavitary parenchyma and 17 had bacilli in sputum at the time of surgery. Lobectomy (51.17%) and pneumonectomy (41.37%) were the main interventions carried out. The operative mortality was 3.44%. Complications such prolonged air leaking and emoyema had occurred in 9 patients. The rate of postoperative microbiological conversion was 88.23%. One patient had a relapse 5 months after surgery. Conclusion. - Surgery associated with medical treatment provides a high cure rate to the detriment of an acceptable morbidity and mortality.

10.1016_j.pdpdt.2013.09.001	Inactivation of multidrug resistant (MDR)-and extensively drug resistant (XDR)-Mycobacterium tuberculosis by photodynamic therapy	We investigated the effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT) on anti-tuberculosis (TB) activity by measuring inactivation rates, expressed as D-value, of MDR- and XDR-Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) clinical strains in vitro. Approximately 106 colony forming unit per milliliter (CFU/ml) of the bacilli were irradiated with various doses of laser light after exposure to photosensitizers. Survival of M. tb was measured by enumerating CFU in 7H10 medium to measure D-values. No inactivation of M. tb was observed when exposed to photosensitizers (radachlorin or DH-I-180-3) only or laser light only (P > 0.1). Treatment with a combination of photosentizer and laser inactivated M. tb although there was a significant difference between the types of photosensitizers applied (P < 0.05). Linear inactivation curves for the clinical M. tb strains were obtained up to laser doses of 30 J/cm(2) but prolonged irradiation did not linearly inactivate M. tb, yielding sigmoid PDT inactivation curves. D-values of M. tb determined from the slope of linear regression lines in PDT were not significantly different and ranged from 10.50 to 12.13 J/cm(2) with 670 nm laser irradiation at 100 mW/cm(2) of the fluency rate, except for a drug-susceptible strain among the clinical strains tested. This suggests that PDT inactivated M. tb clinical strains regardless of drug resistance levels of the bacilli. Intermittent and repeated PDT allowed acceleration of the inactivation of the bacilli as a way to avoid the sigmoid inactivation curves. In conclusion, PDT could be alternative as a new option for treatment for MDR- and XDR-tuberculosis. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

10.1183_09031936.00001913	Clarithromycin increases linezolid exposure in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients	The use of linezolid for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is limited by dose-and time-dependent toxicity. Recently, we reported a case of pharmacokinetic drug drug interaction between linezolid and clarithromycin that resulted in increased linezolid exposure. The aim of this prospective pharmacokinetic study is to quantify the effect of clarithromycin on the exposure of linezolid. Subjects were included in an open-label, single-centre, single-arm, fixed-order pharmacokinetic interaction study. All subjects received 300 mg linezolid twice daily during the entire study, consecutively co-administered with 250 mg and 500 mg clarithromycin once daily. Steady-state serum curves of linezolid and clarithromycin were analysed using validated methods, and differences between pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Linezolid exposure increased by a median (interquartile range) of 44% (23-102%, p=0.043) after co-administration of 500 mg clarithromycin (n=5) compared to baseline, whereas 250 mg clarithromycin had no statistically significant effect. Co-administration was well tolerated by most patients; none experienced severe adverse effects. One patient reported common toxicity criteria grade 2 gastrointestinal adverse events. In this study, we showed that clarithromycin significantly increased linezolid serum exposure after combining clarithromycin with linezolid in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients. The drug drug interaction is possibly P-glycoprotein-mediated. Due to large interpatient variability, therapeutic drug monitoring is advisable to determine individual effect size.

10.1016_j.ijid.2013.06.006	Risk factors for multidrug resistance among previously treated patients with tuberculosis in eastern China: a case-control study	Background: Previous treatment has been documented as a major risk factor for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). However, risk factors for MDR-TB among previously treated patients in China are unclear. This study aimed to ascertain the risk factors for MDR-TB in this particular population in China. Methods: A case-control study was conducted from July through August 2011 in five cities of Zhejiang Province. Cases were previously treated TB patients who had disease resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, whereas controls were previously treated TB patients who had disease sensitive to isoniazid and rifampin. Results: Ninety-eight cases and 83 controls were identified. Multivariate analysis showed that a duration of first treatment of more than 8 months (odds ratio (OR) 2.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-4.52), more than three prior episodes of anti-TB treatment (more than 2 months of continuous treatment as one episode) (OR 5.57, 95% CI 2.38-13.00), adverse effects of anti-TB medication (OR 3.63, 95% CI 1.79-7.36), and more than three TB foci in the lung (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.08-4.37) were associated with MDR-TB in previously treated TB patients. Low family income (p = 0.056) was marginally significant in the univariate analysis. Conclusions: Particular clinical diagnostic results, such as more than three TB foci in the lung, nonstandard or irregular therapy, and adverse effects of anti-TB medication, were found to be associated with MDR-TB in previously treated TB patients. High quality directly observed treatment should be strengthened to ensure that the previously treated patients can receive standard and regular regimens.

10.1007_s12013_013_9589_5	Clinical Benefit of Delamanid (OPC-67683) in the Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients in China	The cure rates are much lower for multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) patients. Delamanid (OPC-67683) has been evaluated in phase-II MDR-TB clinical trials. Herein, we reviewed MDR-TB cases in which treatment regimens, with/without delamanid, were administered. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled; 26 received delamanid-containing regimens (treatment group) while 12 received placebo-containing regimens (control group) for 56 days. Data regarding clinical/radio-microbiological characteristics, drug tolerability, and treatment outcomes were collected. We found that all patients had isolates resistant to a median of 5 (range 2-7) drugs; 24 (92.3 %) patients in treatment group and 11 (91.7 %) in control group had cavities. Culture conversion was obtained in 32 pulmonary TB cases (median 74.5 days). At data censure, 30/38 patients successfully completed therapy with documented negative cultures for at least 18 months before the end of treatment. Two patients (5 consecutive negative cultures) are still on treatment. Six patients had poor outcome (3 failures/2 lost/1 death). In 13 patients, adverse events were observed that included mental disorder, QT interval prolongation, and increased blood cortisol whereas only 3 patients stopped delamanid treatment because of adverse events. It was, therefore, concluded that delamanid was well-tolerated, had low rates of discontinuation, and could be effective for treating MDR-TB.

10.1088_2043_6262_4_4_045015	Synthesis of biocompatible nanoparticle drug complexes for inhibition of mycobacteria	Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most critical infectious diseases affecting the world today. Current TB treatment involves six months long daily administration of four oral doses of antibiotics. Due to severe side effects and the long treatment, a patient's adherence is low and this results in relapse of symptoms causing an alarming increase in the prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB. Hence, it is imperative to develop a new drug delivery technology wherein these effects can be reduced. Rifampicin (RIF) is one of the widely used anti-tubercular drugs (AID). The present study discusses the development of biocompatible nanoparticle-RIF complexes with superior inhibitory activity against both Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). Iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by gas phase condensation and NP-RIF complexes were tested against M. smegmatis SN2 strain as well as M. tuberculosis H37Rv laboratory strain. These complexes showed significantly better inhibition of M. smegmatis SN2 strain at a much lower effective concentration (27.5 mu g ml(-1)) as compared to neat RIF (125 mu g ml(-1)). Similarly M. tuberculosis H37Rv laboratory strain was susceptible to both nanoparticle RIF complex and neat RIF at a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.22 and 1 mu g ml(-1), respectively. Further studies are underway to determine the efficacy of NPs RIF complexes in clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis as well as MDR isolates.	tuberculosis; drug delivery; nanoparticle; RIF-NP complexes	
10.1016_j.jiph.2013.03.003	Primary and acquired drug resistance patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in India: A multicenter study	Tuberculosis is the most prevalent infection worldwide. The emergence of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) isolates emphasizes that it is necessary to monitor drug resistance of the organism against anti-tubercular drugs. We analyzed 327 M. tuberculosis isolates from patients who were cared for at three different health care centers, hereinafter known as study areas (SAs), in North India. Of the 327 total M. tuberculosis isolates, 255 were from a tertiary health care center (Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh [SA-1]), 48 were from a District tuberculosis center (Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan [SA-2]), and 24 were from a different District tuberculosis center (Buxar, Bihar [SA-3]). Drug susceptibility testing against first-line antibiotics (viz. isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, and ethambutol) was conducted for all the isolates using 1% proportional method. We found that the rates of acquired resistance were consistently higher than the rates of initial drug resistance. In new, untreated cases, a higher degree of MDR-TB was observed at SA-1 (13.3%) and SA-3 (25.0%), whereas it was observed in only 7.1% of the isolates at SA-2. In previously treated patients, MDR cases were found in 35.7% of the isolates from SA-1, 66.6% of the isolates from SA-2, and 43.8% of the isolates from SA-3. Resistance to a single drug was found at a much lower rate, ranging from 0.0 to 6.3% in new cases as well as previously treated cases. In conclusion, the primary resistance of M. tuberculosis is low, but acquired drug resistance is slightly higher in North India. (C) 2013 King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences.

10.1371_journal.pone.0077712	Rifampicin Mono-Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: A Significant Phenomenon in a High Prevalence TB-HIV Region	Setting: The dual epidemics of HIV-TB including MDR-TB are major contributors to high morbidity and mortality rates in South Africa. Rifampicin (RIF) resistance is regarded as a proxy for MDR-TB. Currently available molecular assays have the advantage of rapidly detecting resistant strains of MTB, but the GeneXpert does not detect isoniazid (INH) resistance and the GenoTypeMTBDRplus(LPA) assay may underestimate resistance to INH. Increasing proportions of rifampicin mono-resistance resistance (RMR) have recently been reported from South Africa and other countries. Objective: This laboratory based study was conducted at NHLS TB Laboratory, Durban, which is the reference laboratory for culture and susceptibility testing in KwaZulu-Natal. We retrospectively determined, for the period 2007 to 2009, the proportion of RMR amongst Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates, that were tested for both RIF and INH, using the gold standard of culture based phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST). Gender and age were also analysed to identify possible risk factors for RMR. Design: MTB culture positive sputum samples from 16,748 patients were analysed for susceptibility to RIF and INH during the period 2007 to 2009. RMR was defined as MTB resistant to RIF and susceptible to INH. For the purposes of this study, only the first specimen from each patient was included in the analysis. Results: RMR was observed throughout the study period. The proportion of RMR varied from a low of 7.3% to a high of 10.0% [overall 8.8%]. Overall, males had a 42% increased odds of being RMR as compared to females. In comparison to the 50 plus age group, RMR was 37% more likely to occur in the 25-29 year age category. Conclusion: We report higher proportions of RMR ranging from 7.3% to 10% [overall 8.8%] than previously reported in the literature. To avoid misclassification of RMR, detected by the GeneXpert, as MDR-TB, culture based phenotypic DST must be performed on a second specimen, as recommended by the SA NDOH TB guidelines as well as WHO. We suggest that two sputum samples should be obtained at the first visit. The second sputum sample should be stored at 4 degrees C. The latter sample is then readily available for performing additional DST (phenotypic or genotypic) for 2nd lines drugs, resulting in a decreased waiting period for DST results to become available.

10.4269_ajtmh.13_0011	Weight Gain and Response to Treatment for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Alternatives to culture are needed in high burden countries to assess whether response to treatment of multidrug-resistant-tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is satisfactory. The objective was to assess the association of weight gain and treatment outcome. The methods included analysis of clinical, bacteriologic, and weight from 439 MDR-TB patients in the Philippines. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to determine whether 5% weight gain during the first 6 months of treatment was associated with outcome. Three hundred and ten (71%) patients were cured and 129 (29%) had poor outcomes (death, defaulted, or failed treatment). Fifty-three percent were underweight (body mass index [BMI] < 18.5 kg/m(2)) before treatment. Five percent weight gain after completing 3 months of treatment was associated with good outcome among patients who were underweight before treatment (OR 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 4.4). Baseline weight and degree of weight change during the first 6 months of treatment can help identify persons who are more likely to have poor outcomes and require other interventions.

pub-0909	High Throughput Screening of 7-Methylpicene-1,2-Diol as Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase (NAT) Inhibitor to Establish a Isoniazid Supplement in Anti-Tubercular Therapy	Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), due to its unusual organization crosses different immune barriers and causes tuberculosis. The advent of multidrug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has attained alarming situation. Hence, computational drug design has been performed in this work to find potent molecules for this purpose. Isoniazid is a widely used frontline drug against tuberculosis. But reports justified the inactivity of isoniazid on acetylation by Arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT). 35 countries were highlighted to have isoniazid resistance from survey in 1998. Hence, Mtb NAT has been selected as the target in the present case and hundred compounds were screened in order to find potent NAT inhibitor to raise the efficacy of isoniazid. Molecular docking with Biosolveit LeadIT and Autodock 4.2 simulation was performed. The result showed 7-methylpicene-1, 2-diol to have -26.77 and -8.26 kcal/mol score in LeadIT and Autodock 4.2. The work validated 7-methylpicene-1, 2-diol to be a potent NAT inhibitor to supplement isoniazid.

10.1183_09031936.00111812	Assessing spatial heterogeneity of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in a high-burden country	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major concern in countries of the former Soviet Union. The reported risk of resistance among tuberculosis (TB) cases in the Republic of Moldova is among the highest in the world. We aimed to produce high-resolution spatial maps of MDR-TB risk and burden in this setting. We analysed national TB surveillance data collected between 2007 and 2010 in Moldova. High drug susceptibility testing coverage and detailed location data permitted identification of subregional areas of higher MDR-TB risk. We investigated whether the distribution of cases with MDR-TB risk factors could explain this observed spatial variation in MDR-TB. 3447 MDR-TB cases were notified during this period; 24% of new and 62% of previously treated patients had MDR-TB. Nationally, the estimated annual MDR-TB incidence was 54 cases per 100 000 persons and >1000 cases per 100 000 persons within penitentiaries. We identified substantial geographical variation in MDR-TB burden and hotspots of MDR-TB. Locations with a higher percentage of previously incarcerated TB cases were at greater risk of being MDR-TB hotspots. Spatial analyses revealed striking geographical heterogeneity of MDR-TB. Methods to identify locations of high MDR-TB risk and burden should allow for better resource allocation and more appropriate targeting of studies to understand local mechanisms driving resistance.

10.5588_ijtld.13.0182	Monitoring changes in anti-tuberculosis treatment: associated factors determined at the time of diagnosis	OBJECTIVES: To determine predictive factors for changes in standard anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy at the time of diagnosis. METHODS: A prospective study was performed among tuberculosis (TB) patients treated at specialised centres during 2008-2009. Treatment outcome was monitored per standard guidelines. Treatment was considered successful if the patient was cured or completed treatment. Factors associated with treatment modification were analysed at the bivariate and multivariate levels using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 427 patients were included in the study. The initial standard treatment regimen was retained for 249 patients (58.3%), extended to 9 months for 36 (8.4%) and changed for 142 (33.3%). Factors associated with a change of regimen at the multivariate level were female sex, age 50 years, human immunodeficiency virus infection, comorbidities, alcoholism, hospitalisation and culture-positive sputum. Drug resistance and toxicity were analysed independently. Treatment outcome was successful in 97.2% of cases without a regimen change and in 87.3% of those with a changed regimen (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Factors associated with changes in the initial anti-tuberculosis regimen should be considered for rigorous follow-up. Results obtained through individualised treatment provided by specialists were good despite the complexity of the cases treated.	standard regimen; predictive factors; adverse reactions; MDR-TB; treatment outcomes	ACTIVE TUBERCULOSIS; HEPATOTOXICITY; EUROPE
10.5588_ijtld.13.0195	Proficiency of drug susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis against pyrazinamide: the Swedish experience	BACKGROUND: Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a key drug in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), including multidrug-resistant TB. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis against PZA is not included in the World Health Organization's yearly proficiency testing. There is an increasing need to establish quality control of PZA DST. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of PZA DST and to introduce a quality assurance system for the test in Sweden. METHOD: Panels with PZA-susceptible and -resistant isolates were used in three rounds of proficiency testing in all five Swedish clinical TB laboratories and our reference laboratory. All laboratories used the MGIT 960 system. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined and the pncA gene was sequenced to further characterise the 52 panel strains. RESULTS: Good agreement was seen between the phenotypic PZA DST and pncA sequence data, and MIC determination confirmed high levels of resistance. However, in contrast to other drugs, for which correct proficiency test results were observed, specificity problems occurred for PZA DST in some laboratories. CONCLUSIONS: In Sweden, using panel testing, differences were seen in the proficiency of TB laboratories in correctly identifying PZA susceptibility. Improved results were noted in the third round; PZA has therefore been included in yearly proficiency testing.	tuberculosis; pyrazinamide; proficiency testing; MDR-TB	RESISTANCE; NETWORK
10.1016_j.diagmicrobio.2013.06.029	Eleven-year experience on anti-TB drugs direct susceptibility testing from Siriraj Hospital, Thailand	The early detection of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) strains is of utmost importance for patient management and effective TB control programs. This study aimed to demonstrate the performance of direct drug susceptibility testing (DST) performed in our laboratory in the past 11 years. The direct DST was performed on Middlebrook 7H10 medium using isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF), and the results were compared with those obtained from indirect DST (gold standard). The direct DST was performed with 15,598 smear-positive sputum samples, of which 11,284 (72%) yielded reportable results. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated and revealed 89%, 99%, 95%, and 99%, respectively, for RIF and 90%, 98%, 93%, and 97%, respectively, for INH. Direct DST results could be reported within 1 month after sample processing. This method was also shown to be suitable for use in resource-limited countries, particularly in settings with high numbers of TB cases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

10.1007_s40264_013_0091_1	Adverse Events During Treatment of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis: A Comparison Between Patients With or Without Human Immunodeficiency Virus Co-infection	Introdction In settings such as Namibia with a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and drug-resistant (DR) tuberculosis (TB) co-infection, interactions and adverse events associated with second-line anti-TB and antiretroviral medicines pose a unique challenge in the treatment of both infections. Objective The main objective of this study was to compare the absolute risks and risk factors for commonly observed adverse events (occurring in > 20 % of patients) during DR-TB treatment in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients. Methods This was a retrospective cohort analysis of patients treated for DR-TB between January 2008 and February 2010 at the Kondja DR-TB ward in Walvis Bay, Namibia. Data were anonymously collected from patients' treatment records, using a structured form. The data were then analyzed using descriptive statistics, while 2 x 2 contingency tables stratified by HIV status were employed to examine specific risk factor and adverse event relationships, using Epi Info 3.4.3 statistical software. Eighteen adverse events were studied but, because of the small sample size of patients, only the four most frequent ones (occurring in > 20 % of patients) were included in the risk factor analysis. The risk factors were a treatment period of < 4 weeks; treatment with any highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen; specific treatment with a zidovudine (AZT)-based HAART regimen, a cycloserine-based DR-TB regimen or an amikacin-based DR-TB regimen; female gender; baseline body weight a parts per thousand currency sign45 kg; and age 30 a parts per thousand yenyears. Results Of the 57 DR-TB patients who were included in the analysis, 31 (53 %) were co-infected with HIV. When stratified by HIV status, DR-TB patients had similar exposure to specific DR-TB medicines and comparable demographic and clinical characteristics, except for age, as HIV-infected patients were on average 6.5 years older than HIV-uninfected patients (P = 0.007). Of the 18 studied adverse events, tinnitus (40 %), joint pain (26 %), hearing loss (23 %) and nausea (21 %) were the four most commonly observed events. Only for abdominal pain was there a statistically significant difference in the risk of occurrence between HIV-infected patients and HIV-uninfected patients (26 versus 4 %, P = 0.02). The risk ratios (RRs) for the association between treatment with a cycloserine-based DR-TB regimen and occurrence of joint pain did not differ much between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients (RR 4.3 in HIV-infected patients, P = 0.03; RR 5 in HIV-uninfected patients, P = 0.08). Similarly, although some differences in the RRs were observed between the two HIV status groups, the differences were not statistically significant for tinnitus, hearing loss or nausea. In some instances, HIV status appeared to modify the effect of the association of some of the risk factors and adverse event occurrence, but the wide and overlapping confidence intervals were inconclusive. Conclusion Generally, the absolute risks and risk factors for adverse events were similar between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients treated for DR-TB in our Namibian cohort of 57 patients. Although our findings of comparable adverse event risks between DR-TB and DR-TB/HIV co-infected patients are encouraging, they are inconclusive because of the low statistical power of our study. We recommend a prospective study with a larger sample size that would increase the power and therefore the confidence in the results.

10.1128_JCM.01408_13	Identification of Mycobacterium Species and Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex Resistance Determinants by Use of PCR-Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry	PCR coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR-ESI-MS) is a novel technology that has recently been used to identify pathogens from clinical specimens or after culture within about 6 h. We evaluated the MDR-TB (multidrug-resistant tuberculosis) assay, which uses PCR-ESI-MS for detection and identification of Mycobacterium spp. and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) resistance determinants from solid and broth Middlebrook culture media. The performance of the MDR-TB assay was compared to identification using nucleic acid hybridization probes and 16S rRNA gene sequencing for 68 MTBC and 97 nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) isolates grown on agar and 107 cultures grown in Bactec MGIT broth. MTBC resistance profiles from the MDR-TB assay were compared to results with the agar proportion method. The PCR-ESI-MS system correctly identified all MTBC isolates and 97.9% and 95.8% of the NTM isolates from characterized agar cultures and MGIT broth cultures to the species level, respectively. In comparison to the agar proportion method, the sensitivity and specificity for the detection of drug resistance using the MDR-TB assay were 100% and 92.3% for rifampin, 100% and 93.8% for isoniazid, 91.6% and 94.4% for ethambutol, and 100% and 100% for fluoroquinolones, respectively. The MDR-TB assay appears to be a rapid and accurate method for the simultaneous detection and identification of mycobacterial species and resistance determinants of MTBC from culture.

10.1128_JCM.01523_13	Tuberculosis-Spoligo-Rifampin-Isoniazid Typing: an All-in-One Assay Technique for Surveillance and Control of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis on Luminex Devices	"As a follow-up of the ""spoligoriftyping"" development, we present here an extension of this technique which includes the detection of isoniazid resistance-associated mutations in a new 59-plex assay, i.e., tuberculosis-spoligo-rifampin-isoniazid typing (TB-SPRINT), running on microbead-based multiplexed systems. This assay improves the synergy between clinical microbiology and epidemiology by providing (i) mutation-based prediction of drug resistance profiles for patient treatment and (ii) genotyping data for tuberculosis (TB) surveillance. This third-generation microbead-based high-throughput assay for TB runs on the Luminex 200 system and on the recently launched MagPix system (Luminex, Austin, TX). Spoligotyping patterns obtained by the TB-SPRINT method were 100% (n = 85 isolates; 3,655/3,655 spoligotype data points) concordant with those obtained by microbead-based and membrane-based spoligotyping. Genetic drug susceptibility typing provided by the TB-SPRINT method was 100% concordant with resistance locus sequencing (n = 162 for rpoB gene sequencing and n = 76 for katG and inhA sequencing). Considering phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) as the reference method, the sensitivity and specificity of TB-SPRINT regarding Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (n = 162 isolates) rifampin resistance were both 100%, and those for isoniazid resistance were 90.4% (95% confidence interval, 85 to 95%) and 100%, respectively. Used routinely in national TB reference and specialized laboratories, the TB-SPRINT assay should simultaneously improve personalized medicine and epidemiological surveillance of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. This assay is expected to play an emerging role in public health in countries with heavy burdens of MDR TB and/or HIV/TB coinfection. Application of this assay directly to biological samples, as well as development for extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB detection by inclusion of second-line antituberculosis drug-associated mutations, is under development. With bioinformatical methods and data mining to reduce the number of targets to the most informative ones, locally adapted formats of this technique can easily be developed everywhere."

pub-0917	Provisional CDC Guidelines for the Use and Safety Monitoring of Bedaquiline Fumarate (Sirturo) for the Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	"Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, the two most effective of the four first-line TB drugs (the other two drugs being ethambutol and pyrazinamide). MDR TB includes the subcategory of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB), which is MDR TB with additional resistance to any fluoroquinolone and to at least one of three injectable anti-TB drugs (i.e., kanamycin, capreomycin, or amikacin). MDR TB is difficult to cure, requiring 18-24 months of treatment after sputum culture conversion with a regimen that consists of four to six medications with toxic side effects, and carries a mortality risk greater than that of drug-susceptible TB. Bedaquiline fumarate (Sirturo or bedaquiline) is an oral diarylquinoline. On December 28, 2012, on the basis of data from two Phase IIb trials (i.e., well-controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of drugs in patients with a disease or condition to be treated, diagnosed, or prevented), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved use of bedaquiline under the provisions of the accelerated approval regulations for ""serious or life-threatening illnesses"" (21CFR314.500) (Cox EM. FDA accelerated approval letter to Janssen Research and Development. Available at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2012/204384Orig1s000ltr.pdf). This report provides provisional CDC guidelines for FDA-approved and unapproved, or off-label, uses of bedaquiline in certain populations, such as children, pregnant women, or persons with extrapulmonary MDR TB who were not included in the clinical trials for the drug. CDC's Division of TB Elimination developed these guidelines on the basis of expert opinion informed by data from systematic reviews and literature searches. This approach is different from the statutory standards that FDA uses when approving drugs and drug labeling. These guidelines are intended for health-care professionals who might use bedaquiline for the treatment of MDR TB for indicated and off-label uses. Aspects of these guidelines are not identical to current FDA-approved labeling for bedaquiline. Bedaquiline should be used with clinical expert consultation as part of combination therapy (minimum four-drug treatment regimen) and administered by direct observation to adults aged >= 18 years with a diagnosis of pulmonary MDR TB (Food and Drug Administration. SIRTURO [ bedaquiline] tablets label. Available at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/204384s000lbl.pdf). Use of the drug also can be considered for individual patients in other categories (e.g., persons with extrapulmonary TB, children, pregnant women, or persons with HIV or other comorbid conditions) when treatment options are limited. However, further study is required before routine use of bedaquiline can be recommended in these populations. A registry for persons treated with bedaquiline is being implemented by Janssen Therapeutics to track patient outcomes, adverse reactions, laboratory testing results (e.g., diagnosis, drug susceptibility, and development of drug resistance), use of concomitant medications, and presence of other comorbid conditions. Suspected adverse reactions (i.e., any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event) and serious adverse events (i.e., any adverse event that results in an outcome such as death, hospitalization, permanent disability, or a life-threatening situation) should be reported to Janssen Therapeutics at telephone 1-800-526-7736, to FDA at telephone 1-800-332-1088 or at http://www.fda.gov/medwatch, and to CDC's Emergency Operations Center at telephone 1-770-488-7100."

10.1097_01.aids.0000432445.07437.07	Rifampin monoresistant tuberculosis and HIV comorbidity in California, 1993-2008: a retrospective cohort study	Objective:Rifampin monoresistant tuberculosis (RMR-TB) is increasingly identified because of scale-up of rapid molecular tests. The longitudinal association of RMR-TB, multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), and HIV/AIDS is incompletely described.Methods:We examined clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with RMR-TB, isoniazid monoresistant TB (IMR-TB), MDR-TB, and drug-susceptible TB during a 16-year period (1993-2008) in California. TB cases were cross-matched with the state HIV/AIDS registry, and HIV prevalence denominators modeled using nonparametric backcalculation.Results:Of 42582 TB cases, 178 (0.4%), 3469 (8.1%), and 635 (1.5%) were RMR-TB, IMR-TB, and MDR-TB, respectively. From the pre-HAART (1993-1996) to HAART (2005-2008) era, RMR-TB rates declined rapidly (12.0 vs. 0.5 per 100000) among patients with HIV infection. The proportion of patients for whom rifampin resistance indicated RMR-TB (rather than MDR-TB) decreased from 31% [95% confidence interval (CI) 26-38%] to 11% (95% CI 5-19%). In multivariate analysis controlling for HIV coinfection and other covariates, patients with RMR-TB were twice as likely to die as patients with drug-sensitive TB (relative risk 1.94, 95% CI 1.40-2.69).Conclusion:RMR-TB/HIV rates declined substantially over time in association with improved TB control and HIV control in California. Mortality among patients with RMR-TB was high, even after adjusting for HIV status.

10.1371_journal.pone.0078313	High Rate of Hypothyroidism in Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients Co-Infected with HIV in Mumbai, India	Background: Adverse events (AEs) among HIV-infected patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) receiving anti-TB and antiretroviral treatments (ART) are under-researched and underreported. Hypothyroidism is a common AE associated with ethionamide, p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS), and stavudine. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of and risk factors associated with hypothyroidism in HIV/MDR-TB co-infected patients. Methods: This was a prospective, observational cohort study, using routine laboratory data in a Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) clinic in collaboration with Sewri TB Hospital, Mumbai, India. Hypothyroidism was defined as a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) result >10 mIU/L at least once during treatment. Patients having a baseline result and one additional result after 3 months were eligible for enrolment. Results: Between October 2006 and March 2013, 116 patients were enrolled, 69 of whom were included. The median (IQR) age was 38 years (34-43) and 61% were male. By March 2013, 37/69 (54%) had hypothyroidism after at least 90 days of treatment. Age, gender, CD4 counts and stavudine-based ART were not associated with the occurrence of hypothyroidism in multivariate models. The co-administration of PAS and ethionamide was found to double the risk of hypothyroidism (RR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.06-3.54). Discussion: High rate of hypothyroidism was recorded in a Mumbai cohort of MDR-TB/HIV co-infected patients on treatment. This is a treatable and reversible AE, however, it may go undiagnosed in the absence of regular monitoring. Care providers should not wait for clinical symptoms, as this risks compromising treatment adherence. Simple, affordable and reliable point-of-care tools for measuring TSH are needed, especially in high MDR-TB burden countries. Our findings suggest the need for TSH screening at baseline, three months, six months, and every six months thereafter for HIV-infected patients on MDR-TB treatment regimens containing PAS and/or ethionamide, until newer, safer and more efficacious MDR-TB regimens become available.

10.2807_1560_7917.ES2013.18.42.20609	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Uzbekistan: results of a nationwide survey, 2010 to 2011	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB; resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid) is a global public health concern. In 2010-2011, Uzbekistan, in central Asia, conducted its first countrywide survey to determine the prevalence of MDR-TB among TB patients. The proportion of MDR-TB among new and previously treated TB patients throughout the country was measured and risk factors for MDR-TB explored. A total of 1,037 patients were included. MDR-TB was detected in 165 treatment-naive (23.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 17.8%-29.5%) and 207 previously treated (62.0%; 95% CI: 52.5%-70.7%) patients. In 5.3% (95% CI: 3.1%-8.4%) of MDR-TB cases, resistance to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs (extensively drug resistant TB; XDR-TB) was detected. MDR-TB was significantly associated with age under 45 years (adjusted odds ratio: 2.24; 95% CI: 1.45-3.45), imprisonment (1.93; 95% CI: 1.01-3.70), previous treatment (4.45; 95% CI: 2.66-7.43), and not owning a home (1.79; 95% CI: 1.01-3.16). MDR-TB estimates for Uzbekistan are among the highest reported in former Soviet Union countries. Efforts to diagnose, treat and prevent spread of MDR-TB need scaling up.

10.1186_1471_2334_13_478	Utility of the REBA MTB-rifa (R) assay for rapid detection of rifampicin resistant Mycobacterium Tuberculosis	Background: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), including resistance to both rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) referred to as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), has become an increasing global threat in recent years. Effective management of patients infected with MDR-TB strains requires identifying such patients by performing conventional drug-susceptibility testing (DST) on bacteria isolated from sputum, a process that can take up to 2 months. This delay in diagnosis can result in worsening and continued transmission of MDR-TB. Molecular methods that rely upon nucleic acid amplification of specific alleles known to be associated with resistance to specific drugs have been helpful in shortening the time to detect drug resistant TB. Methods: We investigated the utility of the REBA MTB-Rifa (R), a commercially available line probe assay (LPA) for detecting rifampicin (RIF) resistance in the RIF resistance-determining region (RRDR) of the rpoB gene. Altogether, 492 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) clinical isolates and additional 228 smear-and culture-positive sputum samples with confirmed M. tuberculosis were collected from subjects with suspected MDR-TB in South Korea. The results were compared with conventional phenotypic DST and sequencing of the rpoB gene. Results: A total of 215 of the 492 isolates were resistant to RIF by conventional DST, and of which 92.1% (198/215) were MDR-TB strains. The REBA MTB-Rifa (R) assay identified RIF resistance in 98.1% (211/215) of these isolates but failed to identify resistance in four phenotypically RIF resistant isolates. These four isolates lacked mutations in the RRDR but three were confirmed to be MDR-TB strains by sequencing. The sensitivity and specificity of this test for clinical isolates was thus 98.1% (211/215) and 100% (277/277), respectively. When applied directly to 228 smear positive sputum samples, the sensitivity and the specificity of REBA MTB-Rifa (R) assay was 100% (96/96, 132/132), respectively. Conclusions: These findings support the use of the REBA MTB-Rifa (R) assay for rapid detection of RIF resistance on clinical isolates and smear positive sputum samples. The results also suggest that RIF resistance is a good surrogate marker of MDR-TB in South Korea and the need to add more probes to other LPAs which can cover newly identified mutations relevant to RIF resistance.

10.2807_1560_7917.ES2013.18.40.20601	Treatment outcome of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in the United Kingdom: retrospective-prospective cohort study from 2004 to 2007	United Kingdom (UK) guidelines recommend at least 18 months treatment for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Prior to 2008, data on treatment outcome were only available at 12 months and therefore the proportion completing treatment was unknown. This retrospective-prospective cohort study reports on treatment outcomes for MDR-TB patients notified between 2004 and 2007 and examines factors associated with successful outcomes. 70.6% (144/204) completed treatment in 24 months or more, 6.9% (14) stopped treatment, 6.9% (14) died, 7.8% (16) were lost to follow up, 0.5% (1) relapsed and 4.4% (9) were transferred overseas. Following adjustment for age, being non-UK born, non-compliance and having co-morbidities, treatment with a fluoroquinolone (OR 3.09; 95% CI 1.21-7.88; p<0.05) or bacteriostatic drug (OR 4.23; 95% CI 1.60-11.18; p<0.05) were independently associated with successful treatment outcome. Treatment completion for MDR-TB cases remains below the World Health Organization (WHO) target. Our findings support current WHO guidelines for MDR-TB treatment. The UK should consider adopting individualised regimens based on WHO recommended drugs, taking into account drug sensitivities. Improving treatment completion rates will be key to tackling further drug resistance and transmission from untreated infectious cases.

10.1007_s11908_013_0363_z	Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis: Pediatric Guidelines	The World Health Organization estimates that there are 650,000 prevalent cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) globally, and since children (< 15 years of age) constitute up to 20% of the TB caseload in high-burden settings, the number of children with drug-resistant (DR) TB is likely to be substantial. Because bacterial burden at the site of disease is often low, diagnosis involves collection of multiple specimens and a laboratory capable of performing culture, although the Xpert MTB/RIF assay has improved sensitivity over smear examination. The basic principles of treatment for children are the same as those for adults with MDR-TB; however, the treatment regimen is often empiric and based on the drug susceptibility pattern of the source case, if available, or on past history of treatment. Additional challenges arise when MDR-TB is diagnosed and managed in the context of HIV coinfection. HIV-infected children are also treated with antiretroviral therapy medications, which have the potential to interact with second-line anti-TB drugs. Lack of pediatric formulations of second-line drugs and paucity of pharmacokinetic data make dosage challenging. However, when treated appropriately, children with DR TB have good outcomes.

10.1186_1471_2180_13_218	Bactericidal activity of PA-824 against Mycobacterium tuberculosis under anaerobic conditions and computational analysis of its novel analogues against mutant Ddn receptor	Background: The resurgence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and HIV associated tuberculosis (TB) are of serious global concern. To contain this situation, new anti-tuberculosis drugs and reduced treatment regimens are imperative. Recently, a nitroimidazole, PA-824, has been shown to be active against both replicating and non-replicating bacteria. It is activated by the enzyme Deazaflavin-dependent nitroreductase (Ddn) present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis which catalyzes the reduction of PA-824, resulting in the release of lethal reactive nitrogen species (RNS) within the bacteria. In this context, PA-824 was analyzed for its activity against latent tuberculosis under anaerobic conditions and compared with rifampicin (RIF) and pyrazinamide (PZA). Recent mutagenesis studies have identified A76E mutation which affects the above mentioned catalysis and leads to PA-824 resistance. Hence, novel analogues which could cope up with their binding to mutant Ddn receptor were also identified through this study. Results: PA-824 at an optimum concentration of 12.5 mu g/ml showed enhanced bactericidal activity, resulting in 0 CFU/ml growth when compared to RIF and PZA at normal pH and anaerobic condition. Further docking studies revealed that a combinatorial structure of PA-824 conjugated with moxifloxacin (ligand 8) has the highest binding affinity with the wild type and mutant Ddn receptor. Conclusions: PA-824 has been demonstrated to have better activity under anaerobic condition at 12.5 mu g/ml, indicating an optimized dose that is required for overcoming the detoxifying mechanisms of M. tuberculosis and inducing its death. Further, the development of resistance through A76E mutation could be overcome through the in silico evolved ligand 8.

10.2217_imt.13.110	Randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II trial of heat-killed Mycobacterium vaccae (Immodulon batch) formulated as an oral pill (V7)	Aim: A 1-month Phase II trial was conducted in 41 patients with pulmonary TB who were randomized into treatment (n = 20) and placebo (n = 21) arms to investigate the safety and efficacy of an orally-administered therapeutic TB vaccine (V7) containing 10 mu g heat-killed Mycobacterium vaccae provided by Immodulon Therapeutics Ltd (London, UK). Materials & methods: Both arms received conventional anti-TB therapy administered along with a daily pill of V7 or placebo. The subject population had four categories of TB: drug-sensitive TB; retreated TB; drug-resistant TB; and TB with HIV distributed in V7 and placebo arms at 9:4:7:6 and 14:1:6:8 ratios, respectively. Results: The mycobacterial clearance in sputum smears was observed in 72.2% (p < 0.0001) and 19% (p = 0.03) of patients on V7 and placebo, respectively. The average weight accrual among V7 recipients was 2.6 kg (p = 0.002) versus -0.2 kg (p = 0.69) in the control group. Except reduction in fever and increased lymphocyte counts, the changes in other secondary end points, such as hemoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and leukocyte counts, were not statistically different, although the proportion of patients responding favorably to V7 was invariably higher compared with placebo (p = 0.002). In control patients, no difference from baseline levels was noted except decreased hemoglobin content (p = 0.02). Conclusion: Oral M. vaccae was safe and has potential as an adjunct immunotherapy, targeting mucosal immunity, to improve efficacy and shorten treatment duration of TB chemotherapy.	cachexia; clinical trial; DOT; imm02; immunomodulator; inflammation; MDR-TB; mucosa; NCT01380119; therapeutic vaccine	DIAGNOSED PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; HIV-INFECTED ADULTS; ANTITUBERCULOSIS TREATMENT; IMMUNOTHERAPY; TB; CHEMOTHERAPY; VACCINES; CULTURE; THERAPY; ADJUNCT
10.4103_0255_0857.118899	Mutation in katG315 is, possibly, a good prognostic marker for treatment with second-line drugs in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis: A preliminary study	"The aim of this study was to explore baseline data, laboratory and molecular analyses to determine if any could serve as potential prognostic marker(s) for treatment response to second line tuberculosis regimens. Of a total number of 50 multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients starting second-line drug MDR-TB treatment in Iraq, only 21 showed treatment adherence and thus, included in this study. Response to treatment was monitored for 11 months by sputum microscopy and culture. We explored baseline data, laboratory and molecular analyses to determine if any could serve as potential prognostic marker(s) for treatment response. Highly significant association (P = 0.019) was detected between mutations in katG315 codon and good response to second-line anti-TB drugs. Spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit variable number tandem repeat confirmed that katG315-mutatnt isolates were genotypically unrelated. The katG315 mutation is a potential prognostic marker for treatment response to second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs.

10.1128_JCM.01122_13	Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Panama Is Driven by Clonal Expansion of a Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Strain Related to the KZN Extensively Drug-Resistant M. tuberculosis Strain from South Africa	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a significant health problem in Panama. The extent to which such cases are the result of primary or acquired resistance and the strain families involved are unknown. We performed whole-genome sequencing of a collection of 66 clinical MDR isolates, along with 31 drug-susceptible isolates, that were isolated in Panama between 2001 and 2010; 78% of the MDR isolates belong to the Latin American-Mediterranean (LAM) family. Drug resistance mutations correlated well with drug susceptibility profiles. To determine the relationships among these strains and to better understand the acquisition of resistance mutations, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on a genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis. The phylogenetic tree shows that the isolates are highly clustered, with a single strain (LAM9-c1) accounting for nearly one-half of the MDR isolates (29/66 isolates). The LAM9-c1 strain was most prevalent among male patients of working age and was associated with high mortality rates. Members of this cluster all share identical mutations conferring resistance to isoniazid (KatG S315T mutation), rifampin (RpoB S531L mutation), and streptomycin (rrs C517T mutation). This evidence of primary resistance supports a model in which MDR-TB in Panama is driven by clonal expansion and ongoing transmission of several strains in the LAM family, including the highly successful MDR strain LAM9-c1. The phylogenetic analysis also shows that the LAM9-c1 strain is closely related to the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) extensively drug-resistant TB strain identified in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The LAM9-c1 and KZN strains likely arose from a recent common ancestor that was transmitted between Panama and South Africa and had the capacity to tolerate an accumulation of multiple resistance mutations.

10.1017_S1431927613001906	Exploring the Contribution of Mycobacteria Characteristics in Their Interaction with Human Macrophages	Tuberculosis (TB) is a major health problem. The emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) isolates confounds treatment strategies. In Portugal, cases of MDR-TB are reported annually with an increased incidence noted in Lisbon. The majority of these MDR-TB cases are due to closely related mycobacteria known collectively as the Lisboa family and Q1 cluster. Genetic determinants linked to drug resistance have been exhaustively studied resulting in the identification of family and cluster specific mutations. Nevertheless, little is known about other factors involved in development of mycobacteria drug resistance. Here, we complement genetic analysis with the study of morphological and structural features of the Lisboa family and Q1 cluster isolates by using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. This analysis allowed the identification of structural differences, such as cell envelope thickness, between Mtb clinical isolates that are correlated with antibiotic resistance. The infection of human monocyte derived macrophages allowed us to document the relative selective advantage of the Lisboa family isolates over other circulating Mtb isolates.

10.1164_rccm.201303_0604OC	Comparison of Levofloxacin versus Moxifloxacin for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Rationale: Levofloxacin (LFX) and moxifloxacin (MXF) are the two most frequently recommended fluoroquinolones for treatment of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). However, studies comparing the effectiveness of LFX and MXF among patients with MDR-TB are lacking. Objectives: To compare the effectiveness of LFX and MXF in terms of culture conversion after 3 months of treatment for MDR-TB. Methods: In this prospective multicenter randomized open label trial, we randomly assigned 182 patients with MDR-TB (sensitive to LFX and MXF) to receive either LFX (750 mg/day; 90 patients) or MXF (400 mg/day; 92 patients) with a background drug regimen. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who achieved sputum culture conversion at 3 months of treatment. Secondary outcomes were time to culture conversion and time to smear conversion, with data censored at 3 months, and the proportions of adverse drug reactions. Measurements and Main Results: At 3 months of treatment, 68 (88.3%) of the 77 patients in the LFX group and 67 (90.5%) of the 74 in the MXF group showed conversion to negative sputum cultures (odds ratio for LFX compared with MXF, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-2.20). Adverse drug reactions were reported in six patients (7.7%) in the LFX group and four (5.2%) in the MXF group (P = 0.75). Conclusions: The choice of LFX or MXF for treatment of patients with MDR-TB may not affect sputum culture conversion at 3 months of treatment.

10.1007_s10156_013_0566_0	Slide drug susceptibility test for the detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Bangladesh	The present study attempted to comparatively assess and establish a suitable detection method of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) from previously treated TB cases in Bangladesh. Of 130 Zeihl-Neelsen smear-positive fresh sputum specimens, 112 samples were found to contain viable bacilli as visualized under the light-emitting diode fluorescence microscope after fluorescein di-acetate staining, and 109 positive cases were detected through Lowenstein-Jensen culture. The samples were further tested to survey the drug resistance both by slide drug susceptibility test (DST) and by conventional DST: 94 MDR-TB cases were detected within 10 days through the slide DST, whereas 82 cases were observed through the conventional DST, requiring about 3 months. Because the rapidity, sensitivity and accuracy of the slide DST method were found to be comparatively satisfactory when compared to the conventional DST method; we recommend the slide DST method as the standard diagnostic tool in perspective of Bangladesh for the detection of MDR-TB.

10.2174_09298673113209990166	Tuberculosis Clinical Trial Update and the Current Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Portfolio	Tuberculosis (TB), an ongoing public health threat, is worsened by the emergence of drug resistance. With an estimated 630000 cases per year of multidrug resistant (MDR)-TB, and 9% of those being extensively drug resistant (XDR)-TB, there is an urgent need for new and more effective anti-TB drugs. New TB treatment regimens should be able to shorten the duration of therapy that currently takes at least six months. The non-compliance with this long treatment duration is one of the reasons for the development of drug resistance. In spite of the difficulties and alleged lack of interest from the pharmaceutical industry for the discovery and development of new antibiotics, several new or repurposed drugs are being evaluated in clinical trials. This review article summarizes the information available and presents an update on the drugs currently in clinical trials for TB and briefly introduces some new compounds in pre-clinical development.

10.1186_1471_2334_13_442	High clustering rates of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotypes in Panama	Background: Tuberculosis continues to be one of the leading causes of death worldwide and in the American region. Although multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) remains a threat to TB control in Panama, few studies have focused in typing MDR-TB strains. The aim of our study was to characterize MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates using PCR-based genetic markers. Methods: From 2002 to 2004, a total of 231 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from TB cases country-wide were screened for antibiotic resistance, and MDR-TB isolates were further genotyped by double repetitive element PCR (DRE-PCR), (GTG)5-PCR and spoligotyping. Results: A total of 37 isolates (0.85%) were resistant to both isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF). Among these 37 isolates, only two (5.4%) were resistant to all five drugs tested. Dual genotyping using DRE-PCR and (GTG)5-PCR of MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates revealed eight clusters comprising 82.9% of the MDR-TB strain collection, and six isolates (17.1%) showed unique fingerprints. The spoligotyping of MDR-TB clinical isolates identified 68% as members of the 42 (LAM9) family genotype. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis is highly clustered in Panama's metropolitan area corresponding to Panama City and Colon City, and our study reveals the genotype distribution across the country.

10.1186_1471_2334_13_432	Application of quantitative second-line drug susceptibility testing at a multidrug-resistant tuberculosis hospital in Tanzania	Background: Lack of rapid and reliable susceptibility testing for second-line drugs used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) may limit treatment success. Methods: Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from patients referred to Kibong'oto National TB Hospital in Tanzania for second-line TB treatment underwent confirmatory speciation and susceptibility testing. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing on MYCOTB Sensititre plates was performed for all drugs available in the second-line formulary. We chose to categorize isolates as borderline susceptible if the MIC was at or one dilution lower than the resistance breakpoint. M. tuberculosis DNA was sequenced for resistance mutations in rpoB (rifampin), inhA (isoniazid, ethionamide), katG (isoniazid), embB (ethambutol), gyrA (fluoroquinolones), rrs (amikacin, kanamycin, capreomycin), eis (kanamycin) and pncA (pyrazinamide). Results: Of 22 isolates from patients referred for second-line TB treatment, 13 (59%) were MDR-TB and the remainder had other resistance patterns. MIC testing identified 3 (14%) isolates resistant to ethionamide and another 8 (36%) with borderline susceptibility. No isolate had ofloxacin resistance, but 10 (45%) were borderline susceptible. Amikacin was fully susceptible in 15 (68%) compared to only 11 (50%) for kanamycin. Resistance mutations were absent in gyrA, rrs or eis for all 13 isolates available for sequencing, but pncA mutation resultant in amino acid change or stop codon was present in 6 (46%). Ten (77%) of MDR-TB patients had at least one medication that could have logically been modified based on these results (median 2; maximum 4). The most common modifications were a change from ethioniamide to para-aminosalicylic acid, and the use of higher dose levofloxacin. Conclusions: In Tanzania, quantitative second-line susceptibility testing could inform and alter MDR-TB management independent of drug-resistance mutations. Further operational studies are warranted.

10.1371_journal.pone.0073975	Chest Radiograph Findings and Time to Culture Conversion in Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis and HIV in Tugela Ferry, South Africa	Background: The majority of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in South Africa are co-infected with HIV, but the radiographic features of MDR-TB and their relationship with time to sputum culture conversion in the antiretroviral therapy era have not been described. Methods: We reviewed baseline chest radiographs for 56 patients with MDR-TB from a rural area of South Africa. We analyzed the association of cavities, consolidation, pleural effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy with time to sputum culture conversion, adjusting for HIV status, baseline sputum smear and CD4 count. Results: Of the 56 subjects, 49 (88%) were HIV-positive, with a median CD4 count of 136 cells/mm(3) (IQR 65-249). Thirty-two (57%) patients were sputum smear positive. Twenty-two (39%) patients had a cavity and 37 (66%) patients had consolidations. Cavitary disease and consolidations were each associated with longer time to culture conversion on bivariate analysis but not after adjusting for sputum smear status (aORs 1.79 [0.94-3.42] and 1.09 [0.67-1.78], respectively). Positive baseline sputum smear remained independently associated with longer time to conversion (aOR 3.45 [1.39-8.59]). We found no association between pleural effusion or hilar lymphadenopathy and time to conversion. Seventy-nine percent of patients were cured at the end of treatment. Conclusions: Despite high rates of HIV co-infection and advanced immunodeficiency, the majority of patients had severe pathology on baseline chest radiograph. Nevertheless, culture conversion rates were high and treatment outcomes were favorable. Cavitation and consolidation do not appear to have an independent association with time to culture conversion beyond that of baseline sputum smear status.

10.1371_journal.pone.0072036	Comparative Evaluation of GenoType MTBDRplus Line Probe Assay with Solid Culture Method in Early Diagnosis of Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) at a Tertiary Care Centre in India	Background: The objectives of the study were to compare the performance of line probe assay (GenoType MTBDRplus) with solid culture method for an early diagnosis of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), and to study the mutation patterns associated with rpoB, katG and inhA genes at a tertiary care centre in north India. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 269 previously treated sputum-smear acid-fast bacilli (AFB) positive MDR-TB suspects were enrolled from January to September 2012 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences hospital, New Delhi. Line probe assay (LPA) was performed directly on the sputum specimens and the results were compared with that of conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST) on solid media [Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) method]. Results: DST results by LPA and LJ methods were compared in 242 MDR-TB suspects. The LPA detected rifampicin (RIF) resistance in 70 of 71 cases, isoniazid (INH) resistance in 86 of 93 cases, and MDR-TB in 66 of 68 cases as compared to the conventional method. Overall (rifampicin, isoniazid and MDR-TB) concordance of the LPA with the conventional DST was 96%. Sensitivity and specificity were 98% and 99% respectively for detection of RIF resistance; 92% and 99% respectively for detection of INH resistance; 97% and 100% respectively for detection of MDR-TB. Frequencies of katG gene, inhA gene and combined katG and inhA gene mutations conferring all INH resistance were 72/87 (83%), 10/87 (11%) and 5/87 (6%) respectively. The turnaround time of the LPA test was 48 hours. Conclusion: The LPA test provides an early diagnosis of monoresistance to isoniazid and rifampicin and is highly sensitive and specific for an early diagnosis of MDR-TB. Based on these findings, it is concluded that the LPA test can be useful in early diagnosis of drug resistant TB in high TB burden countries.

10.4161_hv.25280	Randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial of heat-killed Mycobacterium vaccae (Longcom batch) formulated as an oral pill (V7)	One-month Phase II trial was conducted in 43 sputum smear-positive patients with pulmonary tuberculosis randomized into treatment (n = 22) and placebo (n = 21) arms to investigate the safety and efficacy of an orally-administered therapeutic TB vaccine (V7) containing 10 g of heat-killed Mycobacterium vaccae provided by Longcom company. Immunotherapy and control groups comprised 8 newly diagnosed (1stDx TB; 18.6%), 6 re-treated (RTB; 14%), and 29 multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB; 67.4%) cases distributed at 5:4:13 and 3:2:16 ratios, respectively. Both arms received conventional TB drugs administered under directly observed therapy. The average weight gain in V7 arm was modest, but statistically significant (0.6 kg; p = 0.004), while placebo patients lost 0.1 kg (p = 0.77). Except defervescence and increased lymphocyte percentage, other secondary endpoints such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), leukocyte counts and hemoglobin content were not significantly affected. In control patients only one secondary endpoint, ESR, has improved. After one month mycobacterial clearance in sputum smears was observed in 31.8% (p = 0.03) and 9.5% (p = 0.83) of patients on V7 and placebo. However, the difference between outcomes in two arms was below significance threshold (p = 0.07). Thus, larger population of patients with prolonged follow-up is required to support these preliminary findings.	inflammation; mycobacterium tuberculosis; drug-resistant TB; therapeutic vaccine; immunomodulator; mucosa; DOT; imm02; NCT01380119	DIAGNOSED PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; HIV-INFECTED ADULTS; IMMUNOTHERAPY; TB; VACCINES; THERAPY; ADJUNCT

10.1183_09031936.00175812	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in children: evidence from global surveillance	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) can affect persons of any age, but it remains unknown whether children are more or less likely than adults to have MDR-TB. Representative drug resistance surveillance data reported to the World Health Organization between 1994 and 2011 were analysed to test the association between MDR-TB and age group (children aged <15 years versus adults aged >= 15 years), using odds ratios derived by logistic regression with robust standard errors. Of 85 countries with data from nationwide surveys or surveillance systems, 35 reported at least one paediatric MDR-TB case. Aggregated data on age and drug susceptibility testing for 323 046 tuberculosis cases notified in these 35 countries were analysed. Odds ratios for MDR-TB in children compared to adults varied widely between countries. In Germany, Namibia, South Africa, the UK and the USA, MDR-TB was positively associated with age <15 years. In the remaining countries no association was established. Despite the limitations intrinsic to the use of surveillance data and to the challenges of diagnosing childhood tuberculosis, our analysis suggests that proportions of MDR-TB in children and adults are similar in many settings. Of particular concern is the association found between age <15 years and MDR-TB in southern African countries with high HIV prevalence.

10.1183_09031936.00147912	Xpert MTB/RIF for diagnosis of tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis: a cost and affordability analysis	Xpert MTB/RIF is a rapid test to diagnose tuberculosis (TB) and rifampicin-resistant TB. Cost and affordability will influence its uptake. We assessed the cost, globally and in 36 high-burden countries, of two strategies for diagnosing TB and multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB: Xpert with follow-on diagnostics, and conventional diagnostics. Costs were compared with funding available for TB care and control, and donor investments in HIV prevention and care. Using Xpert to diagnose MDR-TB would cost US$70-90 million per year globally and be lower cost than conventional diagnostics globally and in all high-burden countries. Diagnosing TB in HIV-positive people using Xpert would also cost US$90-101 million per year and be lower cost than conventional diagnostics globally and in 33 out of 36 high-burden countries. Testing everyone with TB signs and symptoms would cost US$434-468 million per year globally, much more than conventional diagnostics. However, in European countries, Brazil and South Africa, the cost would represent >10% of TB funding. Introducing Xpert to diagnose MDR-TB and to diagnose TB in HIV-positive people is warranted in many countries. Using it to test everyone with TB signs and symptoms is affordable in several middle-income countries, but financial viability in low-income countries requires large increases in TB funding and/or further price reductions.

10.1111_ijn.12178	Using nursing practice guidelines for the prevention of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among hospitalized adult patients in Bangladesh	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is one of the major public health concerns worldwide particularly in developing countries, including Bangladesh. Thus far, there are no well-validated clinical guidelines for the prevention of MDR-TB. This study aims to evaluate the improvement in nurses' practice using the newly developed Nursing Practice Guidelines for the Prevention of MDR-TB (NPG: MDR-TB) among hospitalized adult patients in Bangladesh. The guidelines were developed, disseminated and evaluated among 64 nurses by assessing nursing practice for the prevention of MDR-TB during pre- and postimplementation of the guidelines. Significant differences between pretest and post-test mean scores of nursing practice for the prevention of MDR-TB in case finding and case holding were found in three levels of wards, including Level 0 (non-TB), Level 1 (TB) and Level 2 (MDR-TB) (P<0.001). This indicated that the guidelines might be applicable to reduce the development of MDR-TB in hospitals. However, this was a preliminary study with a limited time frame. Further evaluation is, therefore, needed.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; nursing practice guidelines; nursing practice improvement; prevention of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; preventive nursing practice	CLINICAL GUIDELINES; GENERAL-PRACTICE; DRUG-RESISTANCE; IMPLEMENTATION; HEALTH; DISSEMINATION; MANAGEMENT; RATES
10.2478_rrlm_2013_0027	Molecular detection of rifampicin resistance in multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains from North-Eastern Romania	Introduction: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) represents an important public health problem. Rapid molecular methods detect the mutations responsible for drug- resistance and can shorten the time required for diagnosis and initiation of appropriate therapy. The objectives of our study were to optimize a multiplex allele-specific PCR technique (MAS-PCR) to detect rpoB mutations and to specify the type and frequency of these mutations. Material and methods: We have tested 47 non-duplicate MDR-TB, including extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) strains, identified during 2007-2012, using MAS-PCR for detection of mutations in rpoB codons 531, 526 and 516. Results: The most common mutation was located in codon 531 (63.82%), while only 12.76% and 10.63% of the strains showed mutations in codon 516 and 526, respectively; for six strains we have not identified mutation in the targeted codons. Conclusion: MAS-PCR revealed the mutations prevalent in our region, with good sensitivity (87.2%), suggesting the usefulness of this test in the rapid diagnosis of MDR-TB.

10.5588_ijtld.12.0959	Assessment of tuberculosis burden in China using a dynamic disease simulation model	SETTING: Although a preventable and treatable disease, tuberculosis (TB) is among the top 10 causes of death worldwide. A consequence of inadequately treated drug-susceptible TB (DS-TB) is multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). OBJECTIVES: To improve our understanding of the primary drivers of incidence and prevalence of DS- and MDR-TB in China. METHODS: The Tuberculosis Disease Transmission Model (TBDTM) uses historical and current disease epidemiology and transmission trends and treatment effectiveness, and accounts for annual changes to these to estimate future DS-TB and MDR-TB burden. RESULTS: The model shows that in China, by 2050, incidence, prevalence and mortality of DS-TB will decrease by 32%, 50% and 41%, respectively, whereas MDR-TB will increase by respectively 60%, 48% and 35%. Reduction in DS-TB is a result of high treatment and cure rates leading to a decrease in the prevalence of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI), while the increase in MDR-TB is attributed to inappropriate treatment, leading to high transmission of infection and increased LTBI prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a reduction in DS-TB in China over the next 40 years, while MDR-TB will increase. Improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of MDR-TB are needed to counter this threat. The TBDTM tool has potential value in public health practice by demonstrating the impact of interventions and estimating their cost-effectiveness.

10.1016_j.tube.2013.06.001	CD4(+)FoxP3(+) T regulatory cells in drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Regulatory T cells (T-reg) increase in active tuberculosis (TB). However, whether T-reg-mediated immune suppression affect the susceptibility to active TB or development of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB is not yet clear. We compared circulatory T-reg frequencies in drug susceptible (DS) and MDR TB before and after anti-TB treatment. Circulatory T-reg frequencies were measured in blood samples from 33 DS TB, 7 mycobacterial culture-positive active MDR TB, 16 stable MDR TB who had been culture negative for at least 6 months, and 14 healthy controls before and after treatment. T-reg frequency was measured by flow cytometry using cell-surface marker CD4 and intracellular marker FoxP3. T-reg frequency was higher in DS TB and active MDR TB patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.05), with no significant difference between the former. T-reg frequency was higher in patients with sputum acid-fast bacilli smear-positive TB than in patients with smear-negative TB, but the increase did not correlate with the radiologic extent of TB or presence of a cavity. After successful treatment, T-reg decreased to control levels in DS TB and MDR TB patents. The pattern of change, in which T-reg frequency increased during active infection and normalized to control levels after successful treatment, was similar in DS and MDR TB patients.

10.1093_icvts_ivt251	Pulmonary resection in the treatment of 43 patients with well-localized, cavitary pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Shanghai	OBJECTIVES: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), defined as tuberculosis resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin in vitro, poses a significant challenge to the control of TB worldwide. Despite global efforts to control tuberculosis, it remains the leading cause of death from an infectious agent. Although modern tuberculosis treatment relies on chemotherapy, surgery is accepted as adjuvant treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, 43 MDR-TB patients (28 males and 15 females: mean age 45.3 years) who underwent pulmonary resection between January 1993 and December 2011 were reviewed. Every patient with well-localized, cavitary lesions showed sputum-positive preoperatively. Individually tailored treatment regimens were selected at a once-weekly staff conference following review of the patient's case history and drug susceptibility results. The variables that affected treatment outcomes were identified through multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: There was no surgical mortality. Forty (93.0%) patients demonstrated sputum conversion and/or remained negative after surgery. Each patient had completed treatment, and during a mean of 81 follow-up months (range 18-214 months), 1 patient relapsed. This patient was cured after another course of treatment. Operative procedures included 30 (69.8%) lobectomies, 2 (4.7%) bilobectomies, 8 (18.6%) pneumonectomies and 3 (6.98%) lobectomies plus segmentectomy. There were no operation-related deaths, and there were five major postoperative complications (11.6%). Overall, 40 of 43 (93.0%) MDR-TB patients remained free of TB following surgery. The duration of chemotherapy before surgery had correlation with postoperative outcome (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The proper selection of the patients and early decision for surgical intervention can achieve a high success rate of pulmonary MDR-TB with well-localized pulmonary cavities.

10.1111_tmi.12146	'I cry every day': experiences of patients co-infected with HIV and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	OBJECTIVES To understand patients' challenges in adhering to treatment for MDR-TB/HIV co-infection within the context of their life circumstances and access to care and support. METHODS Qualitative study using in-depth interviews with 12 HIV/MDR-TB co-infected patients followed in a Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) clinic in Mumbai, India, five lay caregivers and ten health professionals. The data were thematically analysed along three dimensions of patients' experience of being and staying on treatment: physiological, psycho-social and structural. RESULTS By the time patients and their families initiate treatment for co-infection, their financial and emotional resources were often depleted. Side effects of the drugs were reported to be severe and debilitating, and patients expressed the burden of care and stigma on the social and financial viability of the household. Family caregivers were crucial to maintaining the mental and physical health of patients, but reported high levels of fatigue and stress. Medecins Sans Frontieres providers recognised that the barriers to patient adherence were fundamentally social, rather than medical, yet were limited in their ability to support patients and their families. CONCLUSIONS The treatment of MDR-TB among HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy is hugely demanding for patients, caregivers and families. Current treatment regimens and case-holding strategies are resource intensive and require high levels of support from family and lay caregivers to encourage patient adherence and retention in care.

10.1111_tmi.12145	Use of the Xpert((R)) MTB/RIF assay for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis comorbidity and multidrug-resistant TB in obstetrics and gynaecology inpatient wards at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia	OBJECTIVES In high-tuberculosis (TB)-endemic countries, comorbidity of pulmonary TB in hospitalised patients with non-communicable diseases is well documented. In this study, we evaluated the use of the Xpert((R)) MTB/RIF assay for the detection of concomitant pulmonary TB in patients admitted to the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia, with a primary obstetric or gynaecological condition. METHODS The Study population were inpatients admitted with a primary obstetric or gynaecological problem who had a concomitant cough and were able to expectorate a sputum sample. Sputum samples from 94 patients were analysed for the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) by standard smear microscopy, MGIT culture, MGIT drug-susceptibility testing (DST) and the Xpert((R)) MTB/RIF assay. The sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert((R)) MTB/RIF assay were evaluated against the culture gold standard. RESULTS Twenty-six of 94 (27.7%) patients had culture-confirmed pulmonary TB. The Xpert((R)) MTB/RIF assay had a sensitivity of 80.8% [95% CI: 60.0-92.7%]) compared against MGIT culture. The Xpert((R)) MTB/RIF assay was more sensitive than sputum smear microscopy (21/26 (80.8%) vs. 13/26 (50.0%), P=0.02) and detected an additional eight culture-confirmed cases. Culture DST analysis identified two monoresistant M.tb strains: one resistant to rifampicin (rifampicin sensitive by the Xpert((R)) MTB/RIF assay) and one to ethambutol. HIV infection was linked with a 3-fold increase in risk of TB, accounting for 87.5% (21/24) of TB cases. 50% of cases presented as comorbidities with other communicable diseases (CDs) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). CONCLUSIONS As an alternative to sputum microscopy, the Xpert (R) MTB/RIF assay provides a sensitive, specific and rapid method for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB in obstetric or gynaecological inpatients. Pulmonary TB is an important cause of concomitant comorbidity to the obstetric or gynaecological condition necessitating admission. TB and HIV comorbidities with other communicable and non-communicable diseases were also common. More proactive screening for TB comorbidity is required in obstetric and gynaecological wards.	tuberculosis; obstetric; gynaecology; maternal; women; Xpert((R)) MTB; RIF assay; sensitivity; specificity; multidrug-resistant TB; MDR-TB; sub-Saharan Africa	HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; MATERNAL MORTALITY; SOUTH-AFRICA; HIV; INFANTS; PREVALENCE; EXPOSURE; WOMEN; RISK
pub-0949	The In Vitro Activity of Products Formed from Exposure of Chlorpromazine to a 266nm LASER Beam Against Species of Mycobacteria of Human Interest	Chlorpromazine (CPZ) was exposed to a 266nm laser beam for different periods of time ranging from minutes to 24 h. At intervals, the products from irradiation were evaluated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and evaluated for their activity against mycobacteria of human interest (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. avium, M. intracellulare and their corresponding reference strains or clinical isolates). With the exception of the M. avium 47107 clinical strain, the products produced from the irradiation of CPZ for,4 h had greater activity against M. intracellulare ATCC, M. avium ATCC, H37Rv and the Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains as opposed to that produced by the unirradiated control. The level of products from the 4-h exposure of CPZ remained the same throughout the next 20 h of irradiation. Of significant note is that the irradiation products of CPZ had lower in vitro cytotoxicity against human cells, suggesting that this approach may be useful for the development of compounds more bioactive than the parental species.

10.5588_ijtld.12.1009	Simple, direct drug susceptibility testing technique for diagnosis of drug-resistant tuberculosis in resource-poor settings	SETTING: The Korean Institute of Tuberculosis, Seoul, Republic of Korea. OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple, direct drug susceptibility testing (DST) technique using Kudoh-modified Ogawa (KMO) medium. DESIGN: The critical concentrations of isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP), kanamycin (KM) and ofloxacin (OFX) for KMO medium were calibrated by comparing the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis on KMO with those on Lowenstein-Jensen (q). The performance of the direct KMO DST technique was evaluated on 186 smear-positive sputum specimens and compared with indirect LJ DST. RESULTS: Agreement of MICs on direct vs. indirect DST was high for INH, RMP and OFX. KM MICs on KMO were 10 mu g/ml higher than those on LJ. The critical concentrations of INH, RAP, OFX and KM for KMO were therefore set at 0.2, 40.0, 2.0, and 40.0 mu g/ml. The evaluation of direct DST of smear-positive sputum specimens showed 100% agreement with indirect LJ DST for INH and RMP. However, the respective susceptible and resistant predictive values were 98.8% and 100% for OFX, and 100% and 80% for KM. CONCLUSION: Direct DST using KMO is useful, with clear advantages of a shorter turnaround time, procedural simplicity and low cost compared to indirect DST. It may be most indicated in resource-poor settings for programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis.

10.1186_1471_2458_13_782	Determinants of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in patients who underwent first-line treatment in Addis Ababa: a case control study	Background: Worldwide, there were 650,000 multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases in 2010, and in 2008 the World Health Organization estimated that 150,000 deaths occurred annually due to MDR-TB. Ethiopia is 15th among the 27 MDR-TB high-burden countries. This study identifies factors associated with the occurrence of MDR-TB in patients who underwent first-line TB treatment in Addis Ababa City. Methods: A case control study was conducted at St. Peter Hospital and five health centers in Addis Ababa from 1 November 2011 to February 30, 2012. Cases were MDR-TB patients who were confirmed with culture and drug-susceptibility testing and were in treatment at St. Peter Hospital during the study period. Controls were patients who were on first-line anti-TB treatment and were registered as cured or having completed treatment in the period 9 April 2009-28 February 2010, in five health centers of Addis Ababa City. Accordingly, 134 cases and an equal number of controls were included in this study. A structured interview questionnaire was used to assess factors that could potentially be associated with the occurrence of MDR-TB. Results: Factors that were significantly associated with MDR-TB: drug side effects during first-line treatment (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 4.5, 95% CI; 1.9- 10.5); treatment not directly observed by a health worker (AOR = 11.7, 95% CI; 4-34.3); interruption of treatment of at least a day (AOR = 13.1, 95% CI 3.0-56.6); duration of treatment between 2 and 7 months (AOR = 14.8, 95% CI 2.3-96.4); and retreatment with the Category II regimen (P = 0.000). In the current study, HIV infection was not significantly associated with the occurrence of MDR-TB. Conclusions: Patients who were not in strict DOTS programs and did not adhere to first-line TB treatment and patients who experienced side effects during first-line treatment and Category II retreatment were at significantly increased risk of developing MDR-TB. The DOTS program should, therefore, be strengthened to increase patient adherence. Drug-susceptibility testing is also highly recommended for all Category I treatment regimen failures before those patients begin the Category II regimen.

10.1186_1471_2334_13_397	Genetic variability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in patients with no known risk factors for MDR-TB in the North-eastern part of Lima, Peru	Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity among Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex circulating in patients with no known risk factors for multi-drug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) living in a high MDR burden area and analyze the relationship between genotypes, primary drug resistance and age. Methods: Samples were collected during January-July 2009. Isolates were tested for drug susceptibility to first-line drugs and were genotyped by spoligotyping and the 15-loci Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Unit (MIRU15). Results: Among the 199 isolates analyzed, 169 (84.9%) were identified in the SpolDB4.0 and 30 (15.1%) could not be matched to any lineage. The most prevalent lineage was Haarlem (29.6%), followed by T (15.6%), Beijing (14.1%), Latin American Mediterranean (12.6%) and U (8.5%). A few isolates belonged to the X and S clades (4.5%). Spoligotype analysis identified clustering among 148 of 169 isolates, whereas with MIRU15 all isolates were unique. Out of 197 strains; 31.5% were resistant to at least one drug, 7.5% were MDR and 22.3% showed any resistance to isoniazid. Conclusion: In contrast with other Latin-American countries where LAM lineage is the most predominant, we found the spoligotype 50 from the Haarlem lineage as the most common. None of the prevailing lineages showed a significant association with age or resistance to isoniazid and/or rifampicin.

10.1186_1471_2334_13_392	Risk factors for infection and disease in child contacts of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a cross-sectional study	Background: Young children exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis have a high risk of disease progression following infection. This study aimed to determine risk factors for M. tuberculosis infection and disease in children following exposure to adults with multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB). Methods: Cross-sectional study; all children aged < 5 years, routinely referred per local guidelines to the provincial specialist MDR-TB clinic, Western Cape Province, South Africa, following identification as contacts of adult MDR-TB source cases, were eligible for enrolment from May 2010 through April 2011. Demographic, clinical and social characteristics were collected. All children underwent HIV and tuberculin skin testing. Results: Of 228 children enrolled (median age: 30 months), 102 (44.7%) were classified as infected. Of these, 15 (14.7%) had TB disease at enrolment. Of 217 children tested for HIV, 8 (3.7%) were positive. In adjusted analysis, child's age (AOR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.13-1.91; p = 0.002) and previous TB treatment history (AOR: 2.51; 95% CI: 1.22-5.17; p = 0.01) were independent risk factors for infection. Increasing age of the MDR-TB source case (AOR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.45-1.00; p = 0.05) was protective and source case alcohol use (AOR: 2.59; 95% CI: 1.29-5.22; p = 0.007) was associated with increased odds of infection in adjusted analysis. Decreasing age of the child (p = 0.01) and positive HIV status (AOR: 25.3; 95% CI: 1.63-393; p = 0.01) were associated with prevalent TB disease. Conclusion: A high proportion of children exposed to MDR-TB are infected or diseased. Early contact tracing might provide opportunities to prevent the progression to TB disease in children identified as having been exposed to MDR-TB.

10.1371_journal.pone.0070919	Programmatically Selected Multidrug-Resistant Strains Drive the Emergence of Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in South Africa	Background: South Africa shows one of the highest global burdens of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB). Since 2002, MDR-TB in South Africa has been treated by a standardized combination therapy, which until 2010 included ofloxacin, kanamycin, ethionamide, ethambutol and pyrazinamide. Since 2010, ethambutol has been replaced by cycloserine or terizidone. The effect of standardized treatment on the acquisition of XDR-TB is not currently known. Methods: We genetically characterized a random sample of 4,667 patient isolates of drug-sensitive, MDR and XDR-TB cases collected from three South African provinces, namely, the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. Drug resistance patterns of a subset of isolates were analyzed for the presence of commonly observed resistance mutations. Results: Our analyses revealed a strong association between distinct strain genotypes and the emergence of XDR-TB in three neighbouring provinces of South Africa. Strains predominant in XDR-TB increased in proportion by more than 20-fold from drug-sensitive to XDR-TB and accounted for up to 95% of the XDR-TB cases. A high degree of clustering for drug resistance mutation patterns was detected. For example, the largest cluster of XDR-TB associated strains in the Eastern Cape, affecting more than 40% of all MDR patients in this province, harboured identical mutations concurrently conferring resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, streptomycin, ethionamide, kanamycin, amikacin and capreomycin. Conclusions: XDR-TB associated genotypes in South Africa probably were programmatically selected as a result of the standard treatment regimen being ineffective in preventing their transmission. Our findings call for an immediate adaptation of standard treatment regimens for M/XDR-TB in South Africa.

10.1371_journal.pone.0071867	Primary Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Hanoi, Viet Nam: Present Status and Risk Factors	Introduction: Resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) to anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs presents a serious challenge to TB control worldwide. We investigated the status of drug resistance, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB, and possible risk factors among newly diagnosed TB patients in Hanoi, the capital of Viet Nam. Methods: Clinical and epidemiological information was collected from 506 newly diagnosed patients with sputum smear- and culture-positive TB, and 489 (96.6%) MTB isolates were subjected to conventional drug susceptibility testing, spoligotyping, and 15-locus variable numbers of tandem repeats typing. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated to analyze the risk factors for primary drug resistance. Results: Of 489 isolates, 298 (60.9%) were sensitive to all drugs tested. Resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, ethambutol, and MDR accounted for 28.2%, 4.9%, 28.2%, 2.9%, and 4.5%, respectively. Of 24 isolates with rifampicin resistance, 22 (91.7%) were MDR and also resistant to streptomycin, except one case. Factors associated with isoniazid resistance included living in old urban areas, presence of the Beijing genotype, and clustered strains [aOR = 2.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-4.35; 1.91, 1.18-3.10; and 1.69, 1.06-2.69, respectively). The Beijing genotype was also associated with streptomycin resistance (aOR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.29-3.40). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection was associated with rifampicin resistance and MDR (aOR = 5.42, 95% CI 2.07-14.14; 6.23, 2.34-16.58, respectively). Conclusion: Isoniazid and streptomycin resistance was observed in more than a quarter of TB patients without treatment history in Hanoi. Transmission of isoniazid-resistant TB among younger people should be carefully monitored in urban areas, where Beijing strains and HIV coinfection are prevalent. Choosing an optimal treatment regimen on the basis of the results of drug susceptibility tests and monitoring of treatment adherence would minimize further development of drug resistance strains.

10.1371_journal.pone.0070763	Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance among New and Previously Treated Sputum Smear-Positive Tuberculosis Patients in Uganda: Results of the First National Survey	Background: Multidrug resistant and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) have become major threats to control of tuberculosis globally. The rates of anti-TB drug resistance in Uganda are not known. We conducted a national drug resistance survey to investigate the levels and patterns of resistance to first and second line anti-TB drugs among new and previously treated sputum smear-positive TB cases. Methods: Sputum samples were collected from a nationally representative sample of new and previously treated sputum smear-positive TB patients registered at TB diagnostic centers during December 2009 to February 2011 using a weighted cluster sampling method. Culture and drug susceptibility testing was performed at the national TB reference laboratory. Results: A total of 1537 patients (1397 new and 140 previously treated) were enrolled in the survey from 44 health facilities. HIV test result and complete drug susceptibility testing (DST) results were available for 1524 (96.8%) and 1325 (85.9%) patients, respectively. Of the 1209 isolates from new cases, resistance to any anti-TB drug was 10.3%, 5% were resistant to isoniazid, 1.9% to rifampicin, and 1.4% were multi drug resistant. Among the 116 isolates from previously treated cases, the prevalence of resistance was 25.9%, 23.3%, 12.1% and 12.1% respectively. Of the 1524 patients who had HIV testing 469 (30.7%) tested positive. There was no association between anti-TB drug resistance (including MDR) and HIV infection. Conclusion: The prevalence of anti-TB drug resistance among new patients in Uganda is low relative to WHO estimates. The higher levels of MDR-TB (12.1%) and resistance to any drug (25.3%) among previously treated patients raises concerns about the quality of directly observed therapy (DOT) and adherence to treatment. This calls for strengthening existing TB control measures, especially DOT, routine DST among the previously treated TB patients or periodic drug resistance surveys, to prevent and monitor development and transmission of drug resistant TB.

10.3978_j.issn.2072_1439.2013.06.30	Factors associated with treatment outcome in 64 HIV negative patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis	Objectives: In this study we aimed to determine the factors associated with treatment outcome in HIV negative patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). Materials and methods: The study comprised 64 (43 female and 21 male) patients in whom second line TB drugs were administered in directly observed treatment (DOT) programme. Achievement of sputum AFB (acid fast bacilli) negativity in the 3rd month of the treatment was accepted as the bacteriologic response. Treatment outcome of the patients and the factors influencing the bacteriologic response were evaluated. Results: The mean time of sputum smear negativity was determined as 3+/-2.2 months. Bacteriologic response was determined in 73.4% of the patients. The mean duration time of the treatment was 16.4+/-8.2 months. Treatment outcome of the patients was determined as cure in 34 (53.1%), default in 18 (28.1%), treatment failure in 1 (1.6%) and exitus in 3 (4.7%) patients. Also, in 8 (12.5%) patients treatment was incomplete and continued. Adverse effects of the drugs were seen in 39 (60.9%) patients with the most frequency of gastrointestinal disturbance (51.5%), psychiatric disorders (15.6%), dermatological effects (12.5%). In logistic regression analysis only presence of cavity and the extensive disease were found to be associated with poor bacteriologic response (OR=1.5, 95% CI: 1.23-1.82, P=0.01 and OR=2, 95% CI: 1.42-2.79, P=0.00, respectively). Conclusions: Although radiological findings might affect the bacteriologic response, MDR TB is a treatable disease if regular and appropriate treatment regimen is administered.

10.1183_09031936.00114812	Evaluation of co-trimoxazole in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Co-trimoxazole (SXT), a combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, has shown in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of SXT in multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) are, thus far, lacking. Therefore, we evaluated its pharmacokinetics and drug susceptibility, along with its tolerability during treatment. Based on drug susceptibility testing, MDR-TB patients received SXT as a part of their MDR treatment. The pharmacokinetic parameters of sulfamethoxazole, the effective component of SXT against M. tuberculosis, were evaluated. The ratio of the area under the curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was used as the best pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter to predict the efficacy of sulfamethoxazole. Adverse effects of SXT were also evaluated. 10 patients with MDR-TB (one of whom had extensively drug-resistant TB) received 480 mg of SXT with a median dosage of 6.5 mg.kg(-1) of SXT (range 6.1-6.8 mg.kg(-1)) once daily for a median treatment period of 381 days (range 129-465 days). In two patients, the dose was escalated to 960 mg. The free AUC0-24/MIC of sulfamethoxazole exceeded 25 in only one patient. SXT was safe and well-tolerated, except for one patient who had gastrointestinal side-effects after receiving 960 mg of SXT. Additional studies are needed to find the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic targets, and consequently to set the optimal dose, of SXT for MDR-TB treatment.

10.1093_jac_dkt103	Decline in rates of acquired multidrug-resistant tuberculosis after implementation of the directly observed therapy, short course (DOTS) and DOTS-Plus programmes in Taiwan	To investigate the impact of the directly observed therapy, short course (DOTS) and DOTS-Plus strategies on changes in resistance profiles among Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). We performed a retrospective analysis of resistance profiles among isolates of MTB obtained from 2160 consecutive patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) between 2005 and 2011 at a referral centre in southern Taiwan. Of the 2160 patients, 70 (3.2) had primary multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB, 178 (8.2) had acquired MDR-TB, 10 (0.5) had primary extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB, 23 (1.1) had acquired XDR-TB and 5 (0.2) had totally drug-resistant (TDR)-TB. Trend analysis revealed that the rates of acquired MDR-TB were significantly lower after implementation of the DOTS and DOTS-Plus programmes (P0.01). There was a significant negative correlation between the coverage rates of the DOTS and DOTS-Plus programmes and the rates of acquired MDR-TB (r0.84, P0.02 and r0.92, P0.03, respectively). The rates of resistance to rifampicin, isoniazid, ofloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin and para-aminosalicylic acid also decreased significantly during the study period. However, the rates of primary MDR-TB remained stable (P0.11). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age ranging from 45 to 64 years, positive acid-fast stain results at the initiation of treatment and treatment without DOTS were independent risk factors associated with acquired MDR-TB. In addition, previous treatment for TB (100 versus 19 for TDR-TB and non-TDR-TB, P0.01) and treatment without DOTS (80 versus 44 for TDR-TB and non-TDR-TB, P0.18) were risk factors for TDR-TB. DOTS and DOTS-Plus are both effective at preventing the acquisition of MDR-TB in Taiwan.	acquired resistance; MDR-TB; XDR-TB; totally drug-resistant tuberculosis	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; MEDICAL-CENTER; FLUOROQUINOLONES
10.5588_ijtld.12.0842	Multidrug- and isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis in three high HIV burden African regions	SETTING: Despite major progress in the surveillance of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), data are lacking for many low-resource countries. World Health Organization estimates of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) rates in Africa are low, and based on very limited data from the African continent. OBJECTIVE: To measure MDR-TB prevalence in sub-Saharan African regions with a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). METHOD: We conducted three anti-tuberculosis drug resistance surveys in sub-Saharan African regions with high HIV-TB coinfection prevalence: Homa Bay (Kenya), Chiradzulu (Malawi) and West Nile region (Uganda). RESULTS: The prevalence of MDR-TB in new patients was found to be low in the three regions: 1.4% (95%CI 0.2-2.6) in Homa Bay, 2.0% (95%CI 0.4-3.6) in Chiradzulu and 0.6% (95%CI 0.0-1.5) in the West Nile region. We found no significant association between MDR-TB and HIV infection. Nonetheless, >= 10% of the new cases surveyed were resistant to isoniazid (INH). CONCLUSION: The relatively high rate of resistance to INH highlights the need for rapid detection of INH resistance in addition to rifampicin (RMP) resistance, to allow rapid modification of treatment to avoid the acquisition of RMP resistance. Drug resistance should be monitored periodically.	tuberculosis; survey; resistance; isoniazid	ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUG-RESISTANCE; SURVEILLANCE
10.5588_ijtld.13.0071	Low treatment initiation rates among multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients in Gauteng, South Africa, 2011	SETTING: Gauteng, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To determine treatment uptake among newly diagnosed multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients and risk markers for non-initiation of treatment. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted including all newly diagnosed MDR-TB patients in Gauteng Province, South Africa, in 2011. Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of those who attended Sizwe Hospital, the designated MDR-TB hospital, were extracted from their medical records. District health offices provided data on patients not seen at Sizwe Hospital. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to determine risk markers for non-initiation of treatment. RESULTS: Of the 942 newly diagnosed MDR-TB patients in Gauteng, only 593 (63%) initiated treatment. Of these, 70 (11.8%) did not maintain treatment up to the fourth month. Among the 349 (37%) who did not initiate treatment, 31.2% died and 46.4% could not be accounted for. Referral for laboratory diagnosis from hospitals, health district of the laboratory diagnosis, human immunodeficiency virus infection and place of residence were independently associated with non-initiation of MDR-TB treatment. CONCLUSION: Untreated patients continue to transmit MDR-TB in the community. These study findings highlight the need to identify and target the causes of non-initiation of treatment in specific settings.

10.5588_ijtld.12.0949	Molecular and phenotypic characterisation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to anti-tuberculosis drugs	SETTING: Dr Cetrangolo Hospital, Buenos Aires, Argentina. OBJECTIVES: To characterise drug-resistant (DR), multidrug-resistant (MDR-) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR-) Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, and identify their genetic profiles, drug resistance levels and resistance-conferring mutations. DESIGN: Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing methods were used to determine drug resistance profiles. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP) and levofloxacin (LVX) from 169 DR tuberculosis (TB) isolates, 78 of them mono-resistant to INH, 13 to RMP, 7 to LVX, and 71 MDR-TB, were determined. Multiplex allele-specific polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing were used to detect mutations in katG,rpoB and gyrA/B genes. Genotyping was performed using spoligotyping and insertion sequence 6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: In total, 38.9% of the INH-resistant (INHR) isolates had an MIC >= 32 mu g/ml; 61.3% of the RMP-resistant (RMPR) isolates had an MIC >= 64 mu g/ml and 55.6% of the LVX-resistant (LVXR) isolates had an MIC 4->= 16 mu g/ml. The main mutations found in INHR isolates were katG315 (53.7%) and inhAP-15 (25.5%), whereas in RMPR isolates the main mutations were rpoB531 (61.9%), followed by rpoB526 (16.7%). LVXR isolates showed mutations in gyrA94/90. Haarlem, LAM and T were the main spoligotyping families found. katG315 was mainly associated with Haarlem and LAM, whereas inhAP-15 was associated with T. CONCLUSIONS: Several isolates showed an association between high INHR levels and katG mutation; others from the Haarlem family were prone to becoming MDR-TB and continue to circulate in the community.

10.1128_AAC.00558_13	Clinical Validation of the Analysis of Linezolid and Clarithromycin in Oral Fluid of Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Linezolid plays an increasingly important role in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). However, patients should be carefully monitored due to time-and dose-dependent toxicity. Clarithromycin plays a more modest role. Therapeutic drug monitoring may contribute to assessment of treatment regimens, helping to reduce toxicity while maintaining adequate drug exposure. Oral fluid sampling could provide a welcome alternative in cases where conventional plasma sampling is not possible or desirable. The aim of this study was to clinically validate the analysis of linezolid and clarithromycin and its metabolite hydroxyclarithromycin in oral fluid of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Serum and oral fluid samples were simultaneously obtained and analyzed by using validated methods, after extensive cross-validation between the two matrices. Passing-Bablok regressions and Bland-Altman analysis showed that oral fluid analysis of linezolid and clarithromycin appeared to be suitable for therapeutic drug monitoring in MDR-TB patients. No correction factor is needed for the interpretation of linezolid oral fluid concentrations with a ratio of the linezolid concentration in serum to that in oral fluid of 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.02). However, the clarithromycin concentration serum/clarithromycin concentration in oral fluid ratio is 3.07 (95% CI, 2.45 to 3.69). Analysis of hydroxyclarithromycin in oral fluid was not possible in this study due to a nonlinear relationship between the concentration in serum and that in oral fluid. In conclusion, the analysis of linezolid (no correction factor) and clarithromycin (correction factor of 3) in oral fluid is applicable for therapeutic drug monitoring in cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis as an alternative to conventional serum sampling. Easy sampling using a noninvasive technique may facilitate therapeutic drug monitoring for specific patient categories.		MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PHARMACOKINETICS; SALIVA; SERUM
10.1128_AAC.00761_13	Potent Rifamycin-Sparing Regimen Cures Guinea Pig Tuberculosis as Rapidly as the Standard Regimen	Strategies involving new drug combinations, as well as new uses of existing drugs, are urgently needed to reduce the time required to cure patients with drug-sensitive or multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB). We compared the sterilizing activity of the standard first-line antitubercular regimen, rifampin-isoniazid-pyrazinamide (RHZ), with that of the novel regimen PA-824-moxifloxacin-pyrazinamide (PaMZ), which is currently being studied in clinical trials (NCT01498419), in the guinea pig model of chronic TB infection, in which animals develop necrotic granulomas histologically resembling their human counterparts. Guinea pigs were aerosol infected with similar to 2 log(10) bacilli of wild-type Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, and antibiotic treatment was initiated 6 weeks after infection. Separate groups of animals received RHZ, PaMZ, or single or two-drug components of the latter regimen administered at human-equivalent doses 5 days/week for a total of 8 weeks. Relapse rates were assessed 3 months after discontinuation of treatment to determine the sterilizing activity of each combination regimen. PaMZ given at human-equivalent doses was safe and well tolerated for the entire treatment period and rendered guinea pig lungs culture negative more rapidly than RHZ did. After 1 month of treatment, 80% and 50% of animals in the RHZ and PaMZ groups, respectively, had lung culture-positive relapse. Both combination regimens prevented microbiological relapse when administered for a total of 2 months. Our data support the use of PaMZ as a novel isoniazid-and rifamycin-sparing regimen suitable for treatment of both drug-sensitive TB and MDR-TB.

10.1093_jac_dkt090	High-level resistance to isoniazid and ethionamide in multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis of the Lisboa family is associated with inhA double mutations	The purpose of this study was to determine the levels of isoniazid and ethionamide resistance and to identify associated mutations in endemic multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the Lisbon metropolitan area, Portugal. Seventeen clinical MDR tuberculosis (TB) strains were characterized by standard and semi-quantitative drug susceptibility testing to assess the level of isoniazid and ethionamide resistance. The genes katG, inhA, ethA and ndh were screened for mutations. All strains were genotyped by 24 loci mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unitvariable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) analysis. All strains showed high-level resistance to both isoniazid (1 mg/L) and ethionamide (25 mg/L). MIRU-VNTR typing revealed the presence of two main clusters, Lisboa3 and Q1, in 16/17 strains, all of which showed the C15T mutation in the promoter region of the inhA gene. The 16 strains belong to the Latino-American-Mediterranean (LAM) genotype and the other strain belongs to the Beijing genotype. Sequencing of the inhA open reading frame revealed that the 16 strains also had mutations in the structural region of the gene, leading to the S94A substitution in 9 strains and the I194T substitution in 7 strains. The results reveal that the presence of a mutation in the inhA regulatory region together with a mutation in the inhA coding region can lead to the development of high-level isoniazid resistance and cross-resistance to ethionamide among the MDR-TB strains circulating in Lisbon. This mutational pattern also hints to a possible involvement of strain-specific factors that could be a feature of the Portuguese MDR-TB strains where the LAM family is the major circulating genotype.	tuberculosis; MDR-TB; resistance levels; LAM family	DRUG-RESISTANCE; IDENTIFICATION; PORTUGAL; DATABASE
10.1016_j.jiph.2013.02.005	Drug resistance in pulmonary tuberculosis in new and previously treated cases: Experience from Turkey	The emergence of drug resistance is a major problem for tuberculosis (TB) control. The aim of this study was to determine the rates of resistance against TB drugs in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Data from 387 patients with active PTB between the years of 1999 and 2004 from the Research and Education Hospital for Chest Diseases and Chest Surgery were evaluated retrospectively. The patients were categorized as new, re-treatment, extrapulmonary and chronic cases. The study group consisted of 268 (69%) new, 57 (14.7%) re-treatment, 49 (12.6%) extrapulmonary and 13 (3.3%) chronic TB cases. The rates of resistance to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (R), ethambutol (E) and streptomycin (S) were calculated separately for each group. The resistance to any of the drugs was 7.8% in the new cases, 58.5% in the re-treatment cases and 100% in the chronic cases. The multidrug-resistance (MDR)-TB rates were found to be 2.16%, 11.3% and 92.3% among the new, re-treatment and chronic cases, respectively. These data are important as they reflect the drug resistance rates during the pre-notification time period in western Turkey. (C) 2013 King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences.

10.1057_jphp.2013.20	Health-care workers' perspectives on workplace safety, infection control, and drug-resistant tuberculosis in a high-burden HIV setting	Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is an occupational hazard for health-care workers (HCWs) in South Africa. We undertook this qualitative study to contextualize epidemiological findings suggesting that HCWs' elevated risk of drug-resistant TB is related to workplace exposure. A total of 55 HCWs and 7 hospital managers participated in focus groups and interviews about infection control (IC). Participants discussed caring for patients with drug-resistant TB, IC measures, occupational health programs, also stigma and support in the workplace. Key themes included: (i) lack of resources that hinders IC, (ii) distrust of IC efforts among HCWs, and (iii) disproportionate focus on individual-level personal protections, particularly N95 masks. IC programs should be evaluated, and the impact of new policies to rapidly diagnose drug-resistant TB and decentralize treatment should be assessed as part of the effort to control drug-resistant TB and create a safe workplace.	multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB); extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB); HIV; South Africa; occupational health	SOUTH-AFRICA; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; NOSOCOMIAL TRANSMISSION; RISK
10.1371_journal.pone.0070064	Patterns of Treatment Interruption among Patients with Multidrug-Resistant TB (MDR TB) and Association with Interim and Final Treatment Outcomes	Background: The reasons that patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) miss treatment are multi-factorial and complex. Identifying patterns of treatment interruption that predict poor outcomes can be used to target program activities aiming to improve treatment adherence. Objective: To characterize patterns of treatment interruption among MDR TB patients and determine the association between patterns and treatment outcomes. Methods: Retrospective analysis of MDR TB patients. A treatment interruption was defined as any time that a patient missed a prescribed dose of treatment for at least 1 day but for a period of less than 2 consecutive months. Patients were characterized by the number, length and variability of interruptions, variability of time between interruptions, and percent of missed doses. Final treatment outcome was dichotomized as a successful (cured or completed) or poor outcome (defaulted, failed, or died). Risk ratios were calculated to determine the association between characteristics of treatment interruption and treatment outcomes. All analyses were conducted in 6 month treatment intervals. Results: Only 7.0% of 583 patients completed treatment without interruption. Of the remaining 542 patients, the median time to the first interruption was 2K months (70 days). In multivariate analysis, patients who had longer interruptions with sporadic variability during the 6-12 month or the 12-18 month treatment period had a significantly increased risk for poor outcomes compared to patients who had short, regular interruptions (RRadj 4.37, 95% CI 1.2-15.8; = 0.03 and RRadj 3.38, 95% CI 1.6-7.1; p = 0.001, respectively). In addition, missing 10% or more of the prescribed doses during any 6 month period in the initial 18 months of therapy significantly increased the risk for poor outcomes (RRadj range 1.55-2.35; p-value range 0.01-0.005). Conclusion: Patients that miss more consecutive days of treatment with sporadic interruption patterns or a greater proportion of treatment are at an increased risk for poor treatment outcomes.

10.1371_journal.pone.0069514	Association of Major Depressive Episode with Negative Outcomes of Tuberculosis Treatment	Background: Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) persists an important contributor to the burden of diseases in developing countries. TB control success is based on the patient's compliance to the treatment. Depressive disorders have been negatively associated with compliance of therapeutic schemes for chronic diseases. This study aimed to estimate the significance and magnitude of major depressive episode as a hazard factor for negative outcomes (NO), including abandon or death in patients receiving TB treatment. Methodology/Principal Findings: A longitudinal study was conducted to evaluate the association of major depressive episode (MDE), as measured by a 5-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) with NO to TB treatment. Patients with confirmed TB were enrolled before the start of TB treatment. Baseline measurements included socio-demographic variables as well as the CES-D, which was also applied every month until the end of the treatment. Death and treatment default were assessed monthly. Survivor function (SF) for NO according to MDE status (CES-D >= 6) at baseline (MDEb) was estimated. Cox's Regression was performed for bivariate analyses as well as for the multivariate model. A total of 325 patients accepted to participate in the study, of which 34 where excluded for diagnosis of MDR-TB. NO was observed in 24 patients (8.2%); 109 (37%) presented MDEb. Statistically significant difference was found on the SF of patients with and without MDEb (0.85 vs. 0.96, p-value = 0.002). The hazard ratio for NO, controlled for age, sex, marital status and instruction level was 3.54 (95% CI 1.43-8.75; p-value = 0.006). Conclusion: The presence of MDE at baseline is associated to NO of TB treatment. Targeting detection and treatment of MDE may improve TB treatment outcomes.

10.1371_journal.pone.0070514	Secreted Acid Phosphatase (SapM) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Is Indispensable for Arresting Phagosomal Maturation and Growth of the Pathogen in Guinea Pig Tissues	Tuberculosis (TB) is responsible for nearly 1.4 million deaths globally every year and continues to remain a serious threat to human health. The problem is further complicated by the growing incidence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), emphasizing the need for the development of new drugs against this disease. Phagosomal maturation arrest is an important strategy employed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis to evade the host immune system. Secretory acid phosphatase (SapM) of M. tuberculosis is known to dephosphorylate phosphotidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) present on phagosomes. However, there have been divergent reports on the involvement of SapM in phagosomal maturation arrest in mycobacteria. This study was aimed at reascertaining the involvement of SapM in phagosomal maturation arrest in M. tuberculosis. Further, for the first time, we have also studied whether SapM is essential for the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis. By deleting the sapM gene of M. tuberculosis, we demonstrate that MtbDsapM is defective in the arrest of phagosomal maturation as well as for growth in human THP-1 macrophages. We further show that MtbDsapM is severely attenuated for growth in the lungs and spleen of guinea pigs and has a significantly reduced ability to cause pathological damage in the host when compared with the parental strain. Also, the guinea pigs infected with MtbDsapM exhibited a significantly enhanced survival when compared with M. tuberculosis infected animals. The importance of SapM in phagosomal maturation arrest as well as in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis establishes it as an attractive target for the development of new therapeutic molecules against tuberculosis.

10.1371_journal.pone.0069267	Cost-Effectiveness Comparison of Genechip and Conventional Drug Susceptibility Test for Detecting Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in China	Background: Genechip (CapitalBio, Beijing, China) is a system for diagnosing resistance to rifampin and isoniazid, which shows high efficiency in detecting drug-resistant tuberculosis. Here, we firstly evaluated the costs of Genechip for detecting the drug susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, compared to conventional drug susceptibility test (DST) in laboratories in China. Methodology/Principal Findings: Data on the costs of the two tests were collected at four hospitals. Costs were calculated using the essential factor cost calculation method. The costs of diagnosing a single case of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) using Genechip and DST were US$22.38 and $53.03, respectively. Taking into account the effect on costs from failure of a certain number of tests to accurately diagnose MDR-TB, the costs of Genechip and DST increased by 17.65% and 5.22%, respectively. The cost of both tests decreased with the increasing prevalence of MDR-TB disease, and the cost of Genechip at a sensitivity of more than 50% was lower than that of DST. When price of Genechip was varied to 50%, 80%, 150%, and 200% of the original price, the cost of Genechip at sensitivities of more than 30%, 40%, 60%, and 70%, respectively, was also lower than that of DST. Conclusions/Significance: This study showed that Genechip was a more cost-effective method of diagnosing MDR-TB compared to conventional DST.

10.1371_journal.pone.0068869	Poor Outcomes in a Cohort of HIV-Infected Adolescents Undergoing Treatment for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Mumbai, India	Background: Little is known about the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in HIV-co-infected adolescents. This study aimed to present the intermediate outcomes of HIV-infected adolescents aged 10-19 years receiving second-line anti-TB treatment in a Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) project in Mumbai, India. Methods: A retrospective review of medical records of 11 adolescents enrolled between July 2007 and January 2013 was undertaken. Patients were initiated on either empirical or individualized second-line ambulatory anti-TB treatment under direct observation. Results: The median age was 16 (IQR 14-18) years and 54% were female. Five (46%) adolescents had pulmonary TB (PTB), two (18%) extrapulmonary disease (EPTB) and four (36%) had both. Median CD4 count at the time of MDR-TB diagnosis was 162.7 cells/ml (IQR: 84.8-250.5). By January 2013, eight patients had final and 3 had interim outcomes. Favourable results were seen in four (36.5%) patients: one was cured and three were still on treatment with negative culture results. Seven patients (64%) had poor outcomes: four (36.5%) died and three (27%) defaulted. Three of the patients who died never started on antiretroviral and/or TB treatment and one died 16 days after treatment initiation. Two of the defaulted died soon after default. All patients (100%) on-treatment experienced adverse events (AEs): two required permanent discontinuation of the culprit drug and two were hospitalized due to AEs. No patient required permanent discontinuation of the entire second-line TB or antiretroviral regimens. Conclusions: Early mortality and mortality after default were the most common reasons for poor outcomes in this study. Early mortality suggests the need for rapid diagnosis and prompt treatment initiation, and adolescents might benefit from active contact-tracing and immediate referral. Default occurred at different times, suggesting the need for continuous, intensified and individualized psychosocial support for co-infected adolescents. Operational research among co-infected adolescents will be especially important in designing effective interventions for this vulnerable group.

10.1186_1471_2334_13_315	Genotyping and clinical characteristics of multidrug and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in a tertiary care tuberculosis hospital in China	Background: There is a lack of information on the clinical characteristics of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB in the Jiangxi Province of China; furthermore, data have not been reported on the utility of mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable-number tandem-repeat (MIRU-VNTR) analyses in genotyping Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated from this region. The aim of this study was to analyse the clinical features of patients with MDR and XDR TB from Jiangxi Province and to evaluate the discriminatory power of the 15-loci MIRU-VNTR method. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on patients diagnosed with MDR and XDR TB at the Jiangxi Chest Hospital from July 2010 to June 2011. The RD105 deletion-targeted multiplex PCR (DTM-PCR) and the 15-loci MIRU-VNTR method were used to determine the genetic background of the identified MDR and XDR M. tuberculosis clinical isolates. Results: Of 804 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates, 159 (159/804, 19.8%) of the isolates were identified as MDR with first-line drug susceptibility testing. Of the 123 available MDR isolates, 13 (13/123, 10.6%) were XDR. The RD105 deletion-targeted multiplex PCR method identified 85 (85/110, 77.3%) MDR and 12 (12/13, 92.3%) XDR isolates as the Beijing genotype. MIRU-VNTR cluster analysis demonstrated that 101 MDR and 13 XDR strains had unique genotype patterns; the remaining 9 MDR strains were in 4 clusters, namely 1 cluster with 3 strains and 3 clusters with 2 strains, resulting in a low clustering rate (4.06%). The Hunter-Gaston discriminatory index (HGDI) of the 15-loci MIRU-VNTR method was as high as 0.992. In addition, clinical surveys showed that 87 (87/110, 79.1%) MDR TB patients and 10 (10/13, 76.9%) XDR TB patients had been previously treated. Diabetes mellitus was the most common comorbidity in both MDR TB (16/110, 14.5%) and XDR TB (2/13, 15.4%) patients. Conclusions: Based on our preliminary data, the MDR and XDR M. tuberculosis clinical isolates identified at the Jiangxi Chest Hospital were genetically diverse and clustered at a low frequency. The 15-loci MIRU-VNTR method showed high discriminatory power and may be used as a first-line genotyping tool in investigating the molecular epidemiology of M. tuberculosis in Jiangxi, China. Decisive measures are urgently needed to effectively prevent and manage MDR and XDR tuberculosis in this province.

10.1186_1752_153X_7_117	Synthesis and structure-activity relationship of 8-substituted protoberberine derivatives as a novel class of antitubercular agents	Background: The emergence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has heightened the need for new chemical classes and innovative strategies to tackle TB infections. It is urgent to discover new classes of molecules without cross-resistance with currently used antimycobacterial drugs. Results: Eighteen new 8-substituted protoberberine derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their anti-mycobacterial activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) strain H(37)Rv. Among them, compound 7g was the most effective antitubercular agent with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.5 mu g/mL. Moreover, it also afforded a potent antitubercular effect against clinically isolated MDR strains of M. tuberculosis with MICs ranging from 0.25 to 1.0 mu g/mL, suggesting a novel mode of action. Conclusions: The structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis revealed that introduction of a substituent at the 8-position in pseudoprotoberberine, especially an n-decyl, could significantly enhance the anti-TB activity. We consider 8-n-decylberberines to be a novel family of anti-tubercular agents with an advantage of inhibiting MDR strains of M. tuberculosis.	8-Substituted-protoberberine; Antitubercular; Structure-activity relationship; Drug-resistance	ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY; IN-VITRO; TUBERCULOSIS; CHINA
10.1186_1472_6963_13_268	Factors influencing specialist care referral of multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis patients in Gauteng/South Africa: a descriptive questionnaire-based study	Background: Sizwe Tropical Diseases Hospital is the only specialized Hospital for the management of multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB and extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB cases in Gauteng Province. In South Africa, there is a mismatch between numbers of individuals with a laboratory diagnosis of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and those being referred for the initiation of specialist treatment. We determined reasons for non-referral of MDR-TB and XDR-TB cases. Methods: We conducted a descriptive questionnaire-based study amongst provincial primary health care facilities (PHC) and hospitals providing routine care for (drug-susceptible) TB, regarding specialist care referral of patients whose TB culture and susceptibility testing confirmed MDR-TB or XDR-TB diagnoses in the first half of 2008. Results: In total 148 cases were analyzed; 144/148 (97%) had MDR-TB and 4/148 (3%) had XDR-TB. The main reason for non-referral to specialist care was loss to follow up, for patients diagnosed in-hospital (74/97; 76%) as well as in PHCs (11/21; 52%). Nineteen per cent (18/97) of patients diagnosed in hospital versus 33% (7/21) of patients diagnosed in PHCs deceased before referral. Conclusions: A significant problem in the fight to control DR-TB is follow-up after diagnosis with a delay in patient tracing. TB Focal Points in hospital need to be strengthened in order to improve on patient follow-up and care, and tracer teams should assist with community follow up.

10.2105_AJPH.2012.301039	Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Among Patients in Baja California, Mexico, and Hispanic Patients in California	Objectives. We sought to compare prevalence and determinants of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) between tuberculosis patients in Baja California, Mexico, and Hispanic patients in California. Methods. Using data from Mexico's National TB Drug Resistance Survey (2008-2009) and California Department of Public Health TB case registry (2004-2009), we assessed differences in MDR-TB prevalence comparing (1) Mexicans in Baja California, (2) Mexico-born Hispanics in California, (3) US-born Hispanics in California, and (4) California Hispanics born elsewhere. Results. MDR-TB prevalence was 2.1% in Baja California patients, 1.6% in Mexico-born California patients, 0.4% in US-born California patients, and 2.7% in Hispanic California patients born elsewhere. In multivariate analysis, previous antituberculosis treatment was associated with MDR-TB (odds ratio [OR] = 6.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.34, 12.96); Mexico-born TB patients in California (OR = 5.08; 95% CI = 1.19, 21.75) and those born elsewhere (OR = 7.69; 95% CI = 1.71, 34.67) had greater odds of MDR-TB compared with US-born patients (reference category). Conclusions. Hispanic patients born outside the US or Mexico were more likely to have MDR-TB than were those born within these countries. Possible explanations include different levels of exposure to resistant strains and inadequate treatment.		SAN-DIEGO COUNTY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; UNITED-STATES; EPIDEMIOLOGY
10.4103_0022_3859.118031	Current status of multidrug resistant tuberculosis in a tertiary care hospital of East Delhi	Background and Objective: Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is caused by infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis which is resistant to both isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF). It is caused by selection of resistant mutant strains due to inadequate treatment and poor compliance. MDR-TB is a major public health problem as the treatment is complicated, cure rates are well below those for drug susceptible tuberculosis and patient remains infectious for months despite receiving the best available therapy. The drug susceptibility pattern of M. tuberculosis is essential for proper control of MDR-TB in every health care setting, hence the study was initiated with the aim of studying the prevalence of MDR-TB in patients attending a tertiary care hospital in east Delhi. Materials and Methods: Five hundred and forty-three pulmonary and extrapulmonary samples from suspected cases of tuberculosis received in the mycobacteriology laboratory from November 2009 through October 2010 were investigated for M. tuberculosis. All the samples were subjected to direct microscopic examination for demonstration of acid fast bacilli followed by culture on Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium to isolate M. tuberculosis. Identification was done by conventional biochemical methods. Drug susceptibility of isolated M. tuberculosis strains was done by conventional 1% proportion method followed by sequencing of RIF resistant isolates to detect mutations to confirm resistance. Results and Conclusions: M. tuberculosis was isolated from 75 out of 543 suspected cases of pulmonary/extrapulmonary TB. Three of the total 75 M. tuberculosis isolates (4%) showed resistance to any one of the first line drugs. Prevalence of MDR-TB was 1.3%. The sequencing of single MDR strain showed mutations at codons 516, 517, and 518. Amplification of rpoB and sequential analysis of the amplicon is a better way of detection of mutation and the evidence of new mutation in this study indicate that mutations continue to arise, probably due to the ability of M. tuberculosis to adapt to drug exposure.

10.4103_0255_0857.115625	Use of GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay to assess drug resistance and mutation patterns of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis isolates in northern India	Purpose: The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major public health problem. The diagnosis of MDR-TB is of paramount importance in establishing appropriate clinical management and infection control measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate drug resistance and mutational patterns in clinical isolates MDR-TB by GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay. Material and Methods: A total of 350 non-repeated sputum specimens were collected from highly suspected drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) cases; which were processed by microscopy, culture, differentiation and first line drug susceptibility testing (DST) using BacT/ALERT 3D system. Results: Among a total of 125 mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains, readable results were obtained from 120 (96%) strains by GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay. Only 45 MDR-TB isolates were analysed for the performance, frequency and mutational patterns by GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay. The sensitivity of the GenoType (R) MDRTBplus assay for detecting individual resistance to rifampicin (RIF), isoniazid (INH) and multidrug resistance was found to be 95.8%, 96.3% and 97.7%, respectively. Mutation in codon S531L of the rpoB gene and codon S315T1 of katG genes were dominated in MDR-TB strains, respectively (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay is highly sensitive with short turnaround times and a rapid test for the detection of the most common mutations conferring resistance in MDR-TB strains that can readily be included in a routine laboratory workflow.

10.1021_ml400088y	Advancement of Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines with Improved Pharmacokinetics and nM Activity vs. Mycobacterium tuberculosis	A set of 14 imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxamides was synthesized and screened against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 12 of these agents were <= 1 mu M against replicating bacteria and 5 compounds (9, 12, 16, 17, and 18) had MIC values <= 0.006 mu M. Compounds 13 and 18 were screened against a panel of MDR and XDR drug resistant clinical Mtb strains with the potency of 18 surpassing that of clinical candidate PA-824 by nearly 10-fold. The in vivo pharmacokinetics of compounds 13 and 18 were evaluated in male mice by oral (PO) and intravenous (IV) routes. These results indicate that readily synthesized imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxamides are an exciting new class of potent, selective anti-TB agents that merit additional development opportunities.

10.3892_mmr.2013.1491	Effect of Chinese herbal medicine extracts on cell-mediated immunity in a rat model of tuberculosis induced by multiple drug-resistant bacilli	Drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis poses a major threat to public health. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of Radix Ranunculi Ternati, Radix Sophorae Flavescentis, Prunella Vulgaris L. and Stellera Chamaejasme L. extracts on cell-mediated immunity in a rat model of tuberculosis (TB) induced by multiple drug-resistant bacilli. The bacterium was isolated from patients infected with pulmonary tuberculosis. The immunological response in humans following infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis involves a number of cytokines, including IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha, which are important for killing intracellular micro-organisms. T helper type 2 (Th2) cells express numerous cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-10, which mainly participate in humoral immunity and induce the phagocytosis of extracellular bacteria and parasites. In the present study, rats were infected with multiple drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in order to establish an MDR-TB model. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and cultivated, and the serum levels Of IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-12 were examined by ELISA. The mRNA expression levels of certain cytokines in PBMCs were additionally detected using RT-PCR. The serum levels of IFN-gamma in the Radix Ranunculi Ternati, Radix Sophorae Flavescentis, Prunella Vulgaris L. and Stellera Chamaejasme L. groups were 2.01 +/- 0.73, 1.92 +/- 0.56, 1.98 +/- 0.67 and 1.94 +/- 0.59 pg/ml; IL-4 levels were 6.01 +/- 1.46, 6.12 +/- 1.35, 6.47 +/- 1.46 and 6.15 +/- 1.44 pg/ml; IL-10 levels were 12.09 +/- 3.07, 12.45 +/- 4.01, 12.13 +/- 3.43 and 12.54 +/- 3.78 pg/ml; and IL-12 levels were 2.99 +/- 0.89, 2.75 +/- 0.84, 3.02 +/- 0.86 and 2.89 +/- 0.75 pg/ml, respectively. These differences were significant compared with the model group (P<0.05). RT-PCR analysis revealed a significant increase in the levels of IFN-gamma and IL-12, and a significant decrease in the mRNA levels of IL-4 and IL-10 (P<0.05). These results indicated that the extracts of Radix Ranunculi Ternati, Radix Sophorae Flavescentis, Prunella Vulgaris L. and Stellera Chamaejasme L. are capable of enhancing cell-mediated immunity in rats by upregulating the levels of genetic transcription. This may explain the observed therapeutic effect of Chinese herbal medicines in the treatment of MDR-TB.

10.1093_heapol_czs069	The making of a public health problem: multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in India	This paper examines how actors construct the public problem of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in India. MDR-TB has been framed by the World Health Organization as a pressing, global public health problem. The responses to MDR-TB are complicated as treatment takes longer and is more expensive than routine TB treatment. This is particularly problematic in countries, such as India, with high patient loads, a large and unregulated private sector, weak health systems and potentially high numbers of MDR-TB cases. This paper analyses how actors struggle for control over ownership, causal theories and political responsibility of the public problem of MDR-TB in India. It combines Gusfield's theory on the construction of public problems with insights from literature on the social construction of diseases and on medical social control. It highlights that there are flexible definitions of public problems, which are negotiated among actor groups and which shift over time. The Indian government has shifted its policy in recent years and acknowledged that MDR-TB needs to be dealt with within the TB programme. The study results reveal how the policy shift happened, why debates on the construction of MDR-TB as a public problem in India continue, and why actors with alternative theories than the government do not succeed in their lobbying efforts. Two main arguments are put forward. First, the construction of the public problem of MDR-TB in India is a social and political process. The need for representative data, international influence and politics define what is controllable. Second, the government seems to be anxious to control the definition of India's MDR-TB problem. This impedes an open, critical and transparent discussion on the definition of the public problem of MDR-TB, which is important in responding flexibly to emerging public health challenges.

10.1016_j.meegid.2013.04.010	Genotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in patients at risk of drug resistance in Bolivia	Bolivia ranks among the 10 Latin American countries with the highest rates of tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug resistant (MDR) TB. In view of this, and of the lacking information on the population structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the country, we,explored genotype associations with drug resistance and clustering by analyzing isolates collected in 2010 from 100 consecutive TB patients at risk of drug resistance in seven of the nine departments in which Bolivia is divided. Fourteen isolates were MDR, 29 had other drug resistance profiles, and 57 were pansusceptible. Spoligotype family distribution was: Haarlem 39.4%, LAM 26.3%, T 22.2%, S 2.0%, X 1.0%, orphan 9.1%, with very low intra-family diversity and absence of Beijing genotypes. We found 66 different MIRU-VNTR patterns; the most frequent corresponded to Multiple Locus Variable Analysis (MLVA) MtbC15 patterns 860, 372 and 873. Twelve clusters, each with identical MIRU-VNTR and spoligotypes, gathered 35 patients. We found no association of genotype with drug resistant or MDR-TB. Clustering associated with SIT 50 and the H3 subfamily to which it belongs (p < 0.0001). The largest cluster involved isolates from three departments and displayed a genotype (SIT 50/MLVA 860) previously identified in Bolivian migrants into Spain and Argentina suggesting that this genotype is widespread among Bolivian patients. Our study presents a first overview of M. tuberculosis genotypes at risk of drug resistance circulating in Bolivia. However, results should be taken cautiously because the sample is small and includes a particular subset of M. tuberculosis population. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

10.1016_j.ijantimicag.2013.02.019	Comparative roles of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin in the treatment of pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a retrospective study	This study compared the efficacy of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Shanghai, China. A retrospective analysis of 158 patients with MDR-TB receiving either moxifloxacin-or levofloxacin-containing regimens was performed. Clinical data from patients were subjected to univariate analysis, stratification and multiple logistic regression to compare the roles of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin in multidrug regimens. In total, 72 patients received 400 mg of moxifloxacin once daily and 86 patients received 509.9 +/- 79.4 mg (mean +/- standard deviation) of levofloxacin once daily together with similar active agents for similar durations. The times to sputum culture conversion were similar. Adverse reactions occurred at comparable rates. The combined treatment success rate was 60.1%, being higher among ofloxacin-susceptible than ofloxacin-resistant cases (67.5% vs. 52.0%; P < 0.05). The success rates for the moxifloxacin group were 65.3% (overall), 77.1% (ofloxacin-susceptible cases) and 54.1% (ofloxacin-resistant cases) in comparison with 55.8%, 60.4% and 50.0%, respectively, for the levofloxacin group. No demographic, clinical, bacteriological or treatment characteristics were independent predictors of favourable outcome. Fourteen patients from the moxifloxacin group and twelve patients from the levofloxacin group had bacteriological relapse after treatment cessation. In conclusion, compared with levofloxacin, moxifloxacin did not show superior efficacy when incorporated into multidrug regimens used for the treatment of MDR-TB.

10.1111_phn.12010	The Strategies of Japanese Public Health Nurses in Medication Support for High-Risk Tuberculosis Patients	Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe the support provided by Japanese public health nurses (PHNs) to high-risk tuberculosis (TB) patients, focusing specifically on the support aimed at preventing interruptions in treatment. Design and Sample: A qualitative descriptive approach was used with a convenience sample of 11 PHNs in Japan who cared for TB patients at highest risk for medication adherence problems. Measures: Semi-structured interviews were conducted to learn the scope and practice of PHNs with high-risk TB patients. Data were analyzed using a qualitative descriptive analysis process. Results: One main theme was identified: Supporting the patients in overcoming tuberculosis, regaining health, and living a healthier life. Three categories with five subcategories described the nurses activities: (1) empathetic and reliable support, (2) motivational strategies for medication adherence, and (3) developing a foundation for healthier life. Conclusions: The nurses interviewed described creative and extraordinary strategies used to promote medication adherence and facilitate development of a healthy posttreatment lifestyle. Their approach was patient-centered and culturally congruent. Findings may be transferrable to PHN practice in other regions as care for this economically disadvantaged and marginalized population is a critical need.	nurse-patient relationship; posttreatment life; public health nursing practice; qualitative descriptive study; tuberculosis	DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; DIRECTLY OBSERVED THERAPY; QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTION; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; TREATMENT ADHERENCE; CASE-MANAGEMENT; MDR-TB; PERSPECTIVE; DOTS; CONTRIBUTE
10.5588_ijtld.12.0795	Phylogenetic lineages of tuberculosis isolates in New Zealand and their association with patient demographics	SETTING: In New Zealand, the lineage genotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates and their role in the epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) are currently unknown. OBJECTIVE: 1) To measure the relative frequency of each phylogenetic lineage of the M. tuberculosis complex in New Zealand, and 2) to examine its relationship with patient demographics and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). METHODS: All non-duplicate M. tuberculosis complex isolates recovered in 2010 and 2011 underwent large sequence polymorphism and/or single nucleotide polymorphism analyses. Mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRU) profiling was also performed for cluster identification. RESULTS: New Zealand isolates were dominated by lineage 4 (Euro-American: 37.8%, 95% CI 33.6-42.2), followed by lineage 1 (Indo-Oceanic: 22.6%, 95% CI 19.1-26.5), lineage 2 (East Asian: 19.5%, 95 % CI 16.2-23.3) and lineage 3 (East-African Indian, which included Central Asian: 17.7%, 95% CI 14.5-21.3). Lineage 2 accounted for 58.1% of MDR-TB cases from 2002 to 2011. Among immigrants, the predominant lineages corresponded to high prevalence lineages in the country of origin. In New Zealand-born individuals, Maori and NZ Europeans share the same predominant lineage, lineage 4, with a higher proportion of non-unique MIRU types observed in Maori cases. Lineage 3 was more prevalent in Maori than in NZ Europeans. CONCLUSION: In New Zealand, M. tuberculosis complex phylogenetic lineage is associated with TB epidemiology in terms of ethnicity, country of origin and MDR-TB.	large sequence polymorphism; single nucleotide polymorphism; mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; TREATMENT FAILURE; BEIJING GENOTYPE; POLYMORPHISM; COUNTRY; RISK
10.5588_ijtld.12.0885.12.0480	Social, economic, and psychological impacts of MDR-TB treatment in Tijuana, Mexico: a patient's perspective	SETTING: The State of Baja California, Mexico, had the highest prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Mexico in 2009. OBJECTIVE: To understand the socio-economic burden of MDR-TB disease and its treatment on patients in Tijuana and Mexicali, Mexico. DESIGN: From July to November 2009, qualitative interviews were conducted with 12 patients enrolled in a US-Mexico binational MDR-TB treatment program, Puentes de Esperanza (Bridges of Hope), which was designed to support MDR-TB patients. In-depth interviews were coded to identify major themes in patient experiences of MDR-TB diagnosis and care. RESULTS: While some patients were able to maintain their pre-MDR-TB lives to a limited extent, most patients reported losing their sense of identity due to their inability to work, social isolation, and stigmatization from family and friends. The majority of participants expressed appreciation for Puentes' role in 'saving their lives'. CONCLUSION: Being diagnosed with MDR-TB and undergoing treatment imposes significant psychological, social and economic stress on patients. Strong social support elements within Puentes helped alleviate these burdens. Improvements to the program might include peer-support groups for patients undergoing treatment and transitioning back into the community after treatment.	qualitative research; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; Mexico	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS
10.5588_ijtld.12.0946	Overall and cause-specific mortality among patients with tuberculosis and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	OBJECTIVE: To assess overall and cause-specific mortality among patients with tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Estonia. DESIGN: A total of 2449 patients diagnosed with active respiratory TB from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2009 were followed up retrospectively until 31 December 2011. To estimate the risk of death, standardised mortality ratios (SMR) and mortality rate ratios (RR) were calculated. RESULTS: The SMR for all-cause mortality among those diagnosed with TB was 5.30 (95% CI 4.85-5.75) in males and 10.00 (95%CI 8.25-11.74) in females. The relative risk of death from TB was higher among MDR-TB patients (adjusted RR in males 2.98, 95%CI 2.00-4.44, and in females 3.26, 95 %CI 1.42-7.50) than among non-MDR-TB patients. Among the cohort of successfully treated patients, the SMR for all-cause mortality was 3.46 (95%CI 3.08-3.84) in males and 6.24 (95%CI 4.86-7.88) in females. Lower education level and foreign ethnicity contributed to the higher risk of mortality. Previous history of successfully treated MDR-TB did not increase the risk of death compared to successfully treated non-MDR-TB. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality among successfully treated TB and MDR-TB patients remained higher than among the general population. It was influenced by foreign ethnicity and lower education but, importantly, not by previous history of MDR-TB.

10.1093_jac_dkt082	Co-occurrence of amikacin-resistant and -susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in clinical samples from Beijing, China	This study examined the phenomenon of heteroresistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates obtained from retreated patients in Beijing, China between 2006 and 2011. The iPLEX Gold assay platform was used to determine the prevalence of heteroresistance to injectable second-line drugs (amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin) in resistant isolates. Heteroresistance was identified in 10.9 of 220 phenotypic amikacin-resistant isolates. Heteroresistance was related mainly to the short duration and repeated use of amikacin and capreomycin during retreatment. These findings further our understanding of the evolution of resistance to injectable drugs used for tuberculosis treatment and help guide the rational use of injectable drugs during therapy.	heteroresistance; MDR-TB; aminoglycoside antibiotics; molecular typing	RIBOSOMAL-RNA GENE; DRUG-RESISTANCE; HETERORESISTANCE; KANAMYCIN; MUTATIONS; CAPREOMYCIN; TIME
10.1164_rccm.201212_2328OC	Contribution of Moxifloxacin or Levofloxacin in Second-Line Regimens with or without Continuation of Pyrazinamide in Murine Tuberculosis	Rationale: High-dose levofloxacin (L) (1,000 mg) was as active as moxifloxacin (M) (400 mg) in an early bactericidal activity trial, suggesting these fluoroquinolones could be used interchangeably. Whether pyrazinamide (Z) contributes sterilizing activity beyond the first 2 months in fluoroquinolone-containing second-line regimens remains unknown. Objectives: We compared the efficacy of M and high-dose L alone or in combination with ethionamide (Et), amikacin (A), and Z given for 2 or 7 months. Methods: A pharmacokinetic study was performed to determine the L dose equivalent to 1,000 mg in humans. Treatment started 2 weeks after aerosol infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Mice received M or L alone or in combination with 2 months of EtZA followed by 5 months of Et or EtZ. Measurements and Main Results: After 2 months of treatment, lung colony-forming unit (CFU) counts were similar in mice receiving either fluoroquinolone alone, but, after 4 and 5 months, CFU counts were 2 log(10) lower in mice receiving M. Mice receiving 2MEtZA/3MEt and 2LEtZA/3LEt had 1.0 and 2.7 log(10) lung CFUs, respectively. When Z was given throughout, both regimens rendered mice culture negative by 5 months, and most mice did not relapse after 7 months of treatment, with fewer relapses observed in the M group after 6 and 7 months of treatment. Conclusions: In murine tuberculosis, M had superior efficacy compared with L despite lower serum drug exposures and may remain the fluoroquinolone of choice for second-line regimens. Z contributed substantial sterilizing activity beyond 2 months influoroquinolone containing second-line regimens, largely compensating for L's weaker activity.	moxifloxacin; levofloxacin; MDR-TB; pharmacokinetics; mouse model	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; EARLY BACTERICIDAL ACTIVITY; INTENSIVE PHASE TREATMENT; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; IN-VIVO; COMPARATIVE PHARMACOKINETICS; STERILIZING ACTIVITIES; DENVER REGIMEN; GATIFLOXACIN
10.1183_09031936.00134712	Resistance to fluoroquinolones and second-Line injectable drugs: impact on multidrug-resistant TB outcomes	A meta-analysis for response to treatment was undertaken using individual data of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) (resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin) patients from 26 centres. The analysis assessed the impact of additional resistance to fluoroquinolones and/or second-line injectable drugs on treatment outcome. Compared with treatment failure, relapse and death, treatment success was higher in MDR-TB patients infected with strains without additional resistance (n=4763; 64%, 95% CI 57-72%) or with resistance to second-line injectable drugs only (n=1130; 56%, 95% CI 45-66%), than in those having resistance to fluoroquinolones alone (n=426; 48%, 95% CI 36-60%) or to fluoroquinolones plus second-line injectable drugs (extensively drug resistant (XDR)-TB) (n=405; 40%, 95% CI 27-53%). In XDR-TB patients, treatment success was highest if at least six drugs were used in the intensive phase (adjusted OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.4-16.6; reference fewer than three drugs) and four in the continuation phase (OR 6.1, 95% CI 1.4-26.3). The odds of success in XDR-TB patients was maximised when the intensive phase reached 6.6-9.0 months duration and the total duration of treatment 20.1-25.0 months. In XDR-TB patients, regimens containing more drugs than those recommended in MDR-TB but given for a similar duration were associated with the highest odds of success. All data were from observational studies and methodologies varied between centres, therefore, the bias may be substantial. Better quality evidence is needed to optimise regimens.

10.1016_j.mcna.2013.03.012	Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) threatens to become the dominant form of tuberculosis in many parts of the world because of decades of inappropriate treatment on a global scale. Infection with MDR-TB is associated with poor outcomes because of delays in treatment and the need for complex, toxic, and long medication regimens. Most cases are undetected because of technological and economic barriers to diagnosing tuberculosis and the availability of assays to test for drug resistance. Experience in treating MDR-TB is scarce. Tuberculosis was once curable, but could become a potentially untreatable infectious disease unless efforts are made to control it.

10.1038_emi.2013.38	Mutations in panD encoding aspartate decarboxylase are associated with pyrazinamide resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a frontline anti-tuberculosis drug that plays a crucial role in the treatment of both drug susceptible and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Resistance to PZA is most commonly associated with mutations in the pncA gene encoding nicotinamidase/pyrazinamidase which converts the prodrug PZA to the active form pyrazinoic acid (POA). RpsA (ribosomal protein S1) involved in trans-translation was recently shown to be a target of PZA and mutations in RpsA are found in some PZA-resistant TB strains. However, some other PZA-resistant strains lack mutations in either pncA or rpsA. To identify potential new mechanisms of PZA resistance, we isolated 174 in vitro mutants of M. tuberculosis H37Rv resistant to PZA to search for resistant isolates that do not have pncA or rpsA mutations. DNA sequencing revealed that 169 of the 174 (97.1%) PZA-resistant mutants had pncA mutations but 5 mutants lacked pncA or rpsA mutations. Whole genome sequencing analyses revealed that the 5 PZA-resistant mutants had different mutations all occurring in the same gene panD encoding aspartate decarboxylase, which is involved in synthesis of beta-alanine that is a precursor for pantothenate and co-enzyme A biosynthesis. panD mutations were identified in naturally PZA-resistant Mycobacterium canetti strain and a PZA-resistant MDR-TB clinical isolate. Future studies are needed to address the role of panD mutations in PZA resistance and confirm PanD as a new target of PZA.	aspartate decarboxylase; mechanism of resistance; mode of action; panD; pyrazinamide	PNCA MUTATIONS; MURINE MODEL; GENE; IDENTIFICATION; CANETTII; STRAIN; H37RV; RPSA
10.1358_dot.2013.49.6.1970865	BEDAQUILINE FOR THE TREATMENT OF PULMONARY, MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS IN ADULTS	After AIDS, tuberculosis (TB) is the leading killer worldwide due to a single infectious agent. Recently, drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis elicited even more severe versions of TB. Bedaquiline inhibits mycobacterial ATP synthase. It shows potent and selective activity in vitro against M. tuberculosis, and in vivo against murine models of TB. Bedaquiline can be combined with antituberculosis and antiretroviral agents. The product displays good oral absorption, has a long terminal half-life and is metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 3A4. In a phase II clinical trial in patients with multidrug-resistant TB, bedaquiline (combined with the standard five-drug, second-line TB regimen), showed a time to 50% culture negative conversion of 78 days, with 81.0% and 52.4% efficacy at weeks 24 and 104, respectively. Bedaquiline was generally safe and well tolerated. At the end of 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved bedaquiline (Sirturo (R)) as part of a combination therapy to treat adults with multidrug-resistant TB.

10.1007_s00586_012_2154_x	Drug resistance patterns in 111 cases of drug-resistant tuberculosis spine	We report the largest study conducted till date of drug resistant tuberculosis in spine analyzing the drug susceptibility patterns in 111 cases of proven drug resistance. An observed cross-sectional study was conducted. Six-hundred and eighty-six patients with positive cultures underwent sensitivity testing to 13 commonly used anti-tubercular drugs using BACTEC MGIT-960 system. Females (60.3%) outnumbered males (39.6%). Only three patients (2.7%) were found HIV positive, and none of these had AIDS. Forty-four (39.6%) patients had taken AKT in the past for some form of tuberculosis. Eight (7.2%) patients had history of treatment default. The drug sensitivity testing revealed 87 (78.3%) cases of multi drug resistance (resistance to both isoniazid and rifampicin) and 3 (2.7%) cases of XDR-TB spine. Of the individual drugs, widespread resistance was present to both isoniazid (92.7%) and rifampicin (81.9%), followed by streptomycin (69.3%). Least resistance was found to kanamycin, amikacin and capreomycin. It is recommended to do routine biopsy, culture and drug sensitivity testing in all patients of tuberculosis spine to guide selection of appropriate second-line drugs when required. In cases of non availability of drug susceptibility testing despite repeated attempts, it is suggested to use data from large series such as this to plan best empirical chemotherapy protocol.

pub-0995	Current issues in the management of tuberculosis in Europe	Tuberculosis is a rare disease in Europe, so that most medical doctors never see a case and, although they know that the disease exists, they usually do not include it among the differential diagnosis of many respiratory or general disorders. Why is it, therefore, still important to speak about TB? This paper analysis some reasons: 1) TB is rare but has not disappeared. In Europe, some 400,000 cases are registered each year, with a slight decreasing tendency over the last few years but great disparities between countries and regions; 2) TB is more frequent in some risk groups, particularly among patients born in a country with a high incidence of disease or in persons exposed to the contact with TB, like close relatives of infectious patients. In EU/EEA, the majority of TB cases are observed among foreign-born persons; 3) if infected, some persons have a higher risk to develop TB. Small children and persons with viral or drug-induced immunosuppression (for instance anti-TNF) must be screened and protected if infected; 4) cases of TB among migrants generally occur after the entry in the country, from reactivation of latent TB acquired before. The border screening does not offer a garantee that the disease has been detected. Due attention to incurring symptoms and easy access to care must be maintained during the whole stay in the country for all foreign-born persons; 5) one of the major threats for the future is the progressive increase in the number of cases resistant to first-line drugs (Multidrug-resistant TB or MDR-TB) in several regions of the world, particularly in Eastern Europe; 6) due to decreasing knowledge and experience with the diagnosis and management of TB, many cases are diagnosed at a late stage.

However, its significance remains unknown. Methods: From January 2004 to April 2009, there were 5,403 patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB from four hospitals in Taiwan. Among them, 116 patients (2.2%) with non-MDR TB whose sputum samples were smear-positive by concentration smear method at the fifth month of treatment were evaluated. Results: Sputum culture yielded Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 10 patients (8.6%, MTB group), nontuberculous mycobacteria in 23(19.8%, NTM group), and no growth in the remaining 83 (71.6%, no-growth group). The relapse rate (22%) was higher in the MTB group (P = .01). Four predictors, smear grading >= 3+ at the fifth month (""S"") (OR, 10.73; 95% CI, 2.67-43.17), no sputum culture conversion on the second month (""C"") (OR, 7.16; 95% CI, 1.45-35.44), lack of directly observed therapy (""O"") (OR, 6.40; 95% CI, 1.54-26.56), and no radiographic improvement at the fifth month (""R"") (OR, 4.18; 95% CI, 1.02-17.10), were associated with viable M tuberculosis (MTB group). An integrated ""SCOR"" index of 1 point for each positive factor had the best discriminatory power for predicting culture results at the fifth month. If the SCOR index was 0, all smear-positive sputum was culture-negative for M tuberculosis. Conclusions: Positive sputum smears by a concentrated smear method at the fifth month of treatment in patients with non-MDR TB, especially those with a low SCOR index, may be due to nonviable bacilli and NTM. Careful review of the quality of patient supervision, bacteriologic data, and chest radiography is crucial."

10.1128_AAC.02346_12	Phase I, Single-Dose, Dose-Escalating Study of Inhaled Dry Powder Capreomycin: a New Approach to Therapy of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) threatens global TB control. The lengthy treatment includes one of the injectable drugs kanamycin, amikacin, and capreomycin, usually for the first 6 months. These drugs have potentially serious toxicities, and when given as intramuscular injections, dosing can be painful. Advances in particulate drug delivery have led to the formulation of capreomycin as the first antituberculosis drug available as a microparticle dry powder for inhalation and clinical study. Delivery by aerosol may result in successful treatment with lower doses. Here we report a phase I, single-dose, dose-escalating study aimed at demonstrating safety and tolerability in healthy subjects and measuring pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. Twenty healthy adults (n = 5 per group) were recruited to self-administer a single dose of inhaled dry powder capreomycin (25-mg, 75-mg, 150-mg, or 300-mg nominal dose) using a simple, handheld delivery device. Inhalations were well tolerated by all subjects. The most common adverse event was mild to moderate transient cough, in five subjects. There were no changes in lung function, audiometry, or laboratory parameters. Capreomycin was rapidly absorbed after inhalation. Systemic concentrations were detected in each dose group within 20 min. Peak and mean plasma concentrations of capreomycin were dose proportional. Serum concentrations exceeded 2 mu g/ml (MIC for Mycobacterium tuberculosis) following the highest dose; the half-life (t(1/2)) was 4.8 +/- 1.0 h. A novel inhaled microparticle dry powder formulation of capreomycin was well tolerated. A single 300-mg dose rapidly achieved serum drug concentrations above the MIC for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, suggesting the potential of inhaled therapy as part of an MDR-TB treatment regimen.

10.1128_JCM.03436_12	Multicenter Evaluation of Genechip for Detection of Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis	"Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), especially multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), is still one of the most serious threats to TB control worldwide. Early diagnosis of MDR-TB is important for effectively blocking transmission and establishing an effective protocol for chemotherapy. Genechip is a rapid diagnostic method based on molecular biology that overcomes the poor biosafety, time consumption, and other drawbacks of traditional drug sensitivity testing (DST) that can detect MDR-TB. However, the Genechip approach has not been effectively evaluated, especially in limited-resource laboratories. In this study, we evaluated the performance of Genechip for MDR-TB in 1,814 patients in four prefectural or municipal laboratories and compared its performance with that of traditional DST. The results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of Genechip were 87.56% and 97.95% for rifampin resistance and 80.34% and 95.82% for isoniazid resistance, respectively. In addition, we found that the positive grade of the sputum smears influenced the judgment of results by Genechip. The test judged only 75% of the specimens of ""scanty"" positive grade. However, the positive grade of the specimens showed no influence on the accuracy of Genechip. Overall, the study suggests that, in limited-resource laboratories, Genechip showed high sensitivity and specificity for rifampin and isoniazid resistance, making it a more effective, rapid, safe, and cost-beneficial method worthy of broader use in limited-resource laboratories in China."

10.1128_JCM.00200_13	Epidemic Spread of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Johannesburg, South Africa	Numerous reports have documented isolated transmission events or clonal outbreaks of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, but knowledge of their epidemic spread remains limited. In this study, we evaluated drug resistance, strain diversity, and clustering rates in patients diagnosed with multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) at the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) Central TB Laboratory in Johannesburg, South Africa, between March 2004 and December 2007. Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing was done using the indirect proportion method, while each isolate was genotyped using a combination of spoligotyping and 12-MIRU typing (12-locus multiple interspersed repetitive unit typing). Isolates from 434 MDR-TB patients were evaluated, of which 238 (54.8%) were resistant to four first-line drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and streptomycin). Spoligotyping identified 56 different strains and 28 clusters of variable size (2 to 71 cases per cluster) with a clustering rate of 87.1%. Ten clusters included 337 (77.6%) of all cases, with strains of the Beijing genotype being most prevalent (16.4%). Combined analysis of spoligotyping and 12-MIRU typing increased the discriminatory power (Hunter Gaston discriminatory index [HGDI] = 0.962) and reduced the clustering rate to 66.8%. Resolution of Beijing genotype strains was further enhanced with the 24-MIRU-VNTR (variable-number tandem repeat) typing method by identifying 15 subclusters and 19 unique strains from twelve 12-MIRU clusters. High levels of clustering among a variety of strains suggest a true epidemic spread of MDR-TB in the study setting, emphasizing the urgency of early diagnosis and effective treatment to reduce transmission within this community.

10.1016_S1473_3099_13_70030_6	Tuberculosis 2013:5 Drug-resistant tuberculosis: time for visionary political leadership	Two decades ago, WHO declared tuberculosis a global emergency, and invested in the highly cost-effective directly observed treatment short-course programme to control the epidemic. At that time, most strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were susceptible to first-line tuberculosis drugs, and drug resistance was not a major issue. However, in 2013, tuberculosis remains a major public health concern worldwide, with prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis rising. WHO estimates roughly 630 000 cases of MDR tuberculosis worldwide, with great variation in the frequency of MDR tuberculosis between countries. In the past 8 years, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis has emerged, and has been reported in 84 countries, heralding the possibility of virtually untreatable tuberculosis. Increased population movement, the continuing HIV pandemic, and the rise in MDR tuberculosis pose formidable challenges to the global control of tuberculosis. We provide an overview of the global burden of drug-resistant disease; discuss the social, health service, management, and control issues that fuel and sustain the epidemic; and suggest specific recommendations for important next steps. Visionary political leadership is needed to curb the rise of MDR and XDR tuberculosis worldwide, through sustained funding and the implementation of global and regional action plans.

10.1007_s10096_012_1798_0	Performance of Cepheid(A (R)) Xpert MTB/RIFA (R) and TB-Biochip(A (R)) MDR in two regions of Russia with a high prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis	"The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of CepheidA (R) Xpert MTB/RIFA (R) (""Xpert"") and TB-BiochipA (R) MDR (""TB-Biochip""). Sputum specimens from adults with presumptive tuberculosis (TB) were homogenized and split for: (1) direct Xpert and microscopy, and (2) concentration for Xpert, microscopy, culture [Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) solid media and Mycobacteria Growth Indicator TubeA (R) (MGIT)], indirect drug susceptibility testing (DST) using the absolute concentration method and MGIT, and TB-Biochip. In total, 109 of 238 (45.8 %) specimens were culture-positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), and, of these, 67 isolates were rifampicin resistant (RIF-R) by phenotypic DST and 64/67 (95.5 %) were isoniazid resistant (INH-R). Compared to culture of the same specimen, a single direct Xpert was more sensitive for detecting MTBC [95.3 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI), 90.0-98.3 %] than direct (59.6 %, 95 % CI, 50.2-68.5 %) or concentrated smear (85.3 %, 95 % CI, 77.7-91.1 %) or LJ culture (80.8 %, 95 % CI, 72.4-87.5 %); the specificity was 86.0 % (95 % CI, 78.9-91.3 %). Compared with MGIT DST, Xpert correctly identified 98.2 % (95 % CI, 91.5-99.9 %) of RIF-R and 95.5 % (95 % CI, 85.8-99.2 %) of RIF-susceptible (RIF-S) specimens. In a subset of 104 specimens, the sensitivity of TB-Biochip for MTBC detection compared to culture was 97.3 % (95 % CI, 91.0-99.5 %); the specificity was 78.1 % (95 % CI, 61.5-89.9 %). TB-Biochip correctly identified 100 % (95 % CI, 94.2-100 %) of RIF-R, 94.7 % (95 % CI, 76.7-99.7 %) of RIF-S, 98.2 % (95 % CI, 91.4-99.9 %) of INH-R, and 78.6 % (95 % CI, 52.1-94.2 %) of INH-S specimens compared to MGIT DST. Xpert and Biochip were similar in accuracy for detecting MTBC and RIF resistance compared to conventional culture methods."

10.1371_journal.pone.0064662	A Pilot Study of an mHealth Application for Healthcare Workers: Poor Uptake Despite High Reported Acceptability at a Rural South African Community-Based MDR-TB Treatment Program	Introduction: As the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal addresses a growing multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) epidemic by shifting care and treatment from trained specialty centers to community hospitals, delivering and monitoring MDR-TB therapy has presented new challenges. In particular, tracking and reporting adverse clinical events have been difficult for mobile healthcare workers (HCWs), trained health professionals who travel daily to patient homes to administer and monitor therapy. We designed and piloted a mobile phone application (Mobilize) for mobile HCWs that electronically standardized the recording and tracking of MDR-TB patients on low-cost, functional phones. Objective: We assess the acceptability and feasibility of using Mobilize to record and submit adverse events forms weekly during the intensive phase of MDR-TB therapy and evaluate mobile HCW perceptions throughout the pilot period. Methods: All five mobile HCWs at one site were trained and provided with phones. Utilizing a mixed-methods evaluation, mobile HCWs' usage patterns were tracked electronically for seven months and analyzed. Qualitative focus groups and questionnaires were designed to understand the impact of mobile phone technology on the work environment. Results: Mobile HCWs submitted nine of 33 (27%) expected adverse events forms, conflicting with qualitative results in which mobile HCWs stated that Mobilize improved adverse events communication, helped their daily workflow, and could be successfully expanded to other health interventions. When presented with the conflict between their expressed views and actual practice, mobile HCWs cited forgetfulness and believed patients should take more responsibility for their own care. Discussion: This pilot experience demonstrated poor uptake by HCWs despite positive responses to using mHealth. Though our results should be interpreted cautiously because of the small number of mobile HCWs and MDR-TB patients in this study, we recommend carefully exploring the motivations of HCWs and technologic enhancements prior to scaling new mHealth initiatives in resource poor settings.

10.1186_1471_2334_13_240	Detection of second-line drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis using oligonucleotide microarrays	Background: The steady rise in the spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) requires rapid and reliable methods to identify resistant strains. The current molecular methods to detect MTB resistance to second-line drugs either do not cover an extended spectrum of mutations to be identified or are not easily implemented in clinical laboratories. A rapid molecular technique for the detection of resistance to second-line drugs in M. tuberculosis has been developed using hybridisation analysis on microarrays. Methods: The method allows the identification of mutations within the gyrA and gyrB genes responsible for fluoroquinolones resistance and mutations within the rrs gene and the eis promoter region associated with the resistance to injectable aminoglycosides and a cyclic peptide, capreomycin. The method was tested on 65 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates with different resistance spectra that were characterised by their resistance to ofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, kanamycin and capreomycin. Also, a total of 61 clinical specimens of various origin (e. g., sputum, bronchioalveolar lavage) were tested. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of the method in the detection of resistance to fluoroquinolones were 98% and 100%, respectively, 97% and 94% for kanamycin, and 100% and 94% for capreomycin. The analytical sensitivity of the method was approximately 300 genome copies per assay. The diagnostic sensitivity of the assay ranging from 67% to 100%, depending on the smear grade, and the method is preferable for analysis of smear-positive specimens. Conclusions: The combined use of the developed microarray test and the previously described microarray-based test for the detection of rifampin and isoniazid resistance allows the simultaneous identification of the causative agents of MDR and XDR and the detection of their resistance profiles in a single day.

10.1186_1471_2334_13_225	Ocular inflammatory disease and ocular tuberculosis in a cohort of patients co-infected with HIV and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Mumbai, India: a cross-sectional study	Background: The prevalence and the patterns of ocular inflammatory disease and ocular tuberculosis (TB) are largely undocumented among Multidrug Resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients co-infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and on antituberculosis and antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods: Lilavati Hospital and Research Center and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) organized a cross-sectional ophthalmological evaluation of HIV/MDR-TB co-infected patients followed in an MSF-run HIV-clinic in Mumbai, India, which included measuring visual acuity, and slit lamp and dilated fundus examinations. Results: Between February and April 2012, 47 HIV/MDR-TB co-infected patients (including three patients with extensively drug-resistant TB) were evaluated. Sixty-four per cent were male, mean age was 39 years (standard deviation: 8.7) and their median (IQR) CD4 count at the time of evaluation was 264 cells/mu L (158-361). Thirteen patients (27%) had detectable levels of HIV viremia (>20 copies/ml). Overall, examination of the anterior segments was normal in 45/47 patients (96%). A dilated fundus examination revealed active ocular inflammatory disease in seven eyes of seven patients (15.5%, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI); 5.1-25.8%). These included five eyes of five patients (10%) with choroidal tubercles, one eye of one patient (2%) with presumed tubercular chorioretinitis and one eye of one patient (2%) with evidence of presumed active CMV retinitis. Presumed ocular tuberculosis was thus seen in a total of six patients (12.7%, 95% CI; 3.2-22.2%). Two patients who had completed anti-TB treatment had active ocular inflammatory disease, in the form of choroidal tubercles (two eyes of two patients). Inactive scars were seen in three eyes of three patients (6%). Patients with extrapulmonary TB and patients <39 years old were at significantly higher risk of having ocular TB [Risk Ratio: 13.65 (95% CI: 2.4-78.5) and 6.38 (95% CI: 1.05-38.8) respectively]. Conclusions: Ocular inflammatory disease, mainly ocular tuberculosis, was common in a cohort of HIV/MDR-TB co-infected patients in Mumbai, India. Ophthalmological examination should be routinely considered in HIV patients diagnosed with or suspected to have MDR-TB, especially in those with extrapulmonary TB.

10.1093_infdis_jit048	Tuberculosis Relapse in Vietnam Is Significantly Associated With Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing Genotype Infections	Background. In Vietnam, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing genotype is associated with multi-drug resistance and is emerging. A possible explanation for this genotype's success is an increased rate of relapse. Methods. In a prospective cohort study, isolates from patients with smear-positive tuberculosis were subjected to drug susceptibility testing and to spoligotyping and variable number of tandem repeats typing before treatment and after recurrence of tuberculosis. Results. Among 1068 patients who were actively followed up over 18 months for recurrence, 23 relapse cases occurred (1.39 cases/100 person-years). After adjustment for genotype, tuberculosis treatment history, and drug resistance, relapse was significantly associated with the Beijing genotype (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 5.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.06-14.55) and isoniazid resistance (aHR, 5.91; 95% CI, 2.16-16.16). Conclusions. The strongly increased relapse rate in tuberculosis cases caused by Beijing strains probably contributes to the successful spread of this genotype in Vietnam and elsewhere.

10.1371_journal.pone.0062034	Diagnosis and Interim Treatment Outcomes from the First Cohort of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients in Tanzania	Setting: Kibong'oto National Tuberculosis Hospital (KNTH), Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Objective: Characterize the diagnostic process and interim treatment outcomes from patients treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Tanzania. Design: A retrospective cohort study was performed among all patients treated at KNTH for pulmonary MDR-TB between November 2009 and September 2011. Results: Sixty-one culture-positive MDR-TB patients initiated therapy, 60 (98%) with a prior history of TB treatment. Forty-one (67%) were male and 9 (14%) were HIV infected with a mean CD4 count of 424 (+/- 106) cells/mu l. The median time from specimen collection to MDR-TB diagnosis and from diagnosis to initiation of MDR-TB treatment was 138 days (IQR 101-159) and 131 days (IQR 32-233), respectively. Following treatment initiation four (7%) patients died (all HIV negative), 3 (5%) defaulted, and the remaining 54 (89%) completed the intensive phase. Most adverse drug reactions were mild to moderate and did not require discontinuation of treatment. Median time to culture conversion was 2 months (IQR 1-3) and did not vary by HIV status. In 28 isolates available for additional second-line drug susceptibility testing, fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside and para-aminosalicylic acid resistance was rare yet ethionamide resistance was present in 9 (32%). Conclusion: The majority of MDR-TB patients from this cohort had survived a prolonged referral process, had multiple episodes of prior TB treatment, but did not have advanced AIDS and converted to culture negative early while completing an intensive inpatient regimen without serious adverse event. Further study is required to determine the clinical impact of second-line drug susceptibility testing and the feasibility of alternatives to prolonged hospitalization.

10.1371_journal.pone.0063128	From Multidrug- to Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis: Upward Trends as Seen from a 15-Year Nationwide Study	"Background: Emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) represents an enormous challenge to Public Health globally. Methods: Progression towards XDR-TB was investigated in Belgium, a country with a typically low TB incidence, by analyzing the magnitude, characteristics, and treatment success of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) through a population-based study from 1994 to 2008. Results: Among the 174 MDR-TB patients, 81% were foreign-born, 48% of these being asylum seekers. Although the number of MDR-TB patients remained stable through the study period at around 15 new cases annually, frequencies of resistance of the patients' first MDR-TB isolate to second-line drugs increased, as well as the total number of antibiotics it was resistant to (p<0.001). XDR-TB cases were detected from 2002 onwards. For 24 patients, additional resistance to several second-line drugs was acquired during treatment. Molecular-guided investigations indicated little to no contribution of in-country clonal spread or exogenous re-infection. The increase of pre-XDR and XDR cases could be attributed to rising proportions of patients from Asia and Central and Eastern Europe (p<0.001) and an increase in the isolation of Beijing strains in these groups (p<0.001). Despite augmented resistance, the treatment success rate improved from 63.0% to 75.8% (p = 0.080) after implementation in 2005 of improved surveillance measures and therapeutic access. Conclusions: Increasing severity in drug resistance patterns leading to more XDR- and ""panresistant"" TB cases in a country with a low TB incidence like Belgium represents a strong alert on worsening situations in other world regions and requires intense public health measures."

10.1016_j.indcrop.2013.03.005	Profile of antimicrobial potential of fifteen Hypericum species from Portugal	The aim of the present study was the search for the industrial exploitation potential of 15 Hypericum species crops from Portugal. Although Hypericum pelforatum is well known worldwide, scarce studies have been published of Hypericum spp. identified in Portugal. Extracts from 15 Hypericum species were screened for its antimicrobial activities against 2 Gram and 2 Gram+ bacteria, 4 non-tuberculous Mycobacterium species, a reference strain H(37)Rv and 4 drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as 4 drug-resistant clinical isolates. In terms of Gram - standards, H. humifusum and H. elodes were the most active against Agrobacterium tumefasciens, with MIC of 2.5 mu g/mL. H. elodes and H. hircinum subsp. majus extracts were the most active against MDR-TB strains and isolates, with MIC of 25-100 mu g/mL and both exhibited significant effect against MDR-TB clinical isolates. With the exception of H. androsaemum and H. linarifolium all Hypericum species were active against Staphylococcus aureus, the H. perfoliatum and H. elodes at the level of 6 and 12 mu g/mL, respectively, and none showed activity on E. coli. Reference compounds isolated from H. perforatum were also tested and might contribute to the activities observed. The profile of the 15 Hypericum spp. as effective antimicrobial therapy against multidrug resistant pathogens is now available, providing scientific validation on a few available ethnopharmacological data resources. This study may be a starting point for the research on the role of various Hypericum species in integrative medicine for infection control of S. aureus and MDR-MTB. Hypericum species may also constitute a source of new leads towards the discovery of either new candidates and biologically active compounds for pharmaceutical interest, for the treatment of multidrug resistant diseases.

10.5588_ijtld.12.0792	Outcomes of children treated for tuberculosis with second-line medications in Georgia, 2009-2011	BACKGROUND: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is a major public threat in countries of the former Soviet Union, including Georgia. There are few studies of pediatric DR-TB cases, especially at a national level. OBJECTIVE: To report the characteristics and treatment outcomes of pediatric multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases in Georgia. METHODS: We extracted data on all pediatric (age <16 years) MDR-TB cases notified in Georgia from 2009 to 2011. We assessed the baseline and treatment characteristics and treatment outcomes of this cohort. RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2011, there were 45 notified pediatric DR-TB cases in Georgia. Just over half had previously received anti-tuberculosis treatment and the median age was 7.7 years. Time from diagnosis to treatment was short (median 16 days), and the median length of treatment was 20.2 months. Of those not still on treatment, 77.1% (95%CI 61.0-87.9) had a successful outcome. CONCLUSIONS: One of the first reports of pediatric DR-TB treatment outcomes at a national level, this study demonstrates that successful outcomes can be achieved.	children; Georgia; multidrug-resistant TB; pediatrics	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; COMMUNITY-BASED THERAPY; PEDIATRIC TUBERCULOSIS; RISK-FACTORS; MDR-TB; PREVALENCE; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT
10.1128_AAC.02403_12	Epidemiology of Antituberculosis Drug Resistance in Saudi Arabia: Findings of the First National Survey	The real magnitude of antituberculosis (anti-TB) drug resistance in Saudi Arabia is still unknown because the available data are based on retrospective laboratory studies that were limited to hospitals or cities. A representative national survey was therefore conducted to investigate the levels and patterns of anti-TB drug resistance and explore risk factors. Between August 2009 and July 2010, all culture-positive TB patients diagnosed in any of the tuberculosis reference laboratories of the country were enrolled. Isolates obtained from each patient were tested for susceptibility to first-line anti-TB drugs by the automated Bactec MGIT 960 method. Of the 2,235 patients enrolled, 75 cases (3.4%) were lost due to culture contamination and 256 (11.5%) yielded nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Finally, 1,904 patients (85.2% of those enrolled) had available drug susceptibility testing results. Monoresistance to streptomycin (8.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.2 to 9.1), isoniazid (5.4%; 95% CI, 4.7 to 6.2), rifampin (1%; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.3) and ethambutol (0.8%; 95% CI, 0.5 to 1.2) were observed. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was found in 1.8% (95% CI, 1.4 to 2.4) and 15.9% (95% CI, 15.4 to 16.5) of new and previously treated TB cases, respectively. A treatment history of active TB, being foreign-born, having pulmonary TB, and living in the Western part of the country were the strongest independent predictors of MDR-TB. Results from the first representative national anti-TB drug resistance survey in Saudi Arabia suggest that the proportion of MDR-TB is relatively low, though there is a higher primary drug resistance. A strengthened continuous surveillance system to monitor trends over time and second-line anti-TB drug resistance as well as implementation of innovative control measures, particularly among immigrants, is warranted.

10.1016_j.tube.2013.02.003	Evaluation of antimycobacterial activity of a sulphonamide derivative	Mycobacterial infections including Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been increasing globally. The additional prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) strains and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) stimulate an urgent need for the development of new drugs for the treatment of mycobacterial infections. It is very important to test the antimicrobial activity of novel compounds because they can be used in new with antimycobacterial drug formulation. Studies have shown that Mycobacterium smegmatis can be used in Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) assays with the advantage of rapidly and safely screen anti-tubercular compounds. This paper presents an evaluation of potential mycobacteriological compounds derived from inorganic synthesis and their microbiological performance along and in conjunction with Trimethoprim. Antimicrobial activity experiments were carried out by using the microdilution technique in broth to evaluate the sensibility against M. smegmatis. MIC values were between 0.153 and 4.88 mg/ml for the compounds tested. Tests of interaction between drugs were made by the method of Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index (FICI). The compound [Au (sulfatiazolato)(PPh3)] showed synergism FICI = 0.037 and was evaluated by isobols. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.1371_journal.pone.0059903	Linkage of Presumptive Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Patients to Diagnostic and Treatment Services in Cambodia	Setting: National Tuberculosis Programme, Cambodia. Objective: In a cohort of TB patients, to ascertain the proportion of patients who fulfil the criteria for presumptive MDR-TB, assess whether they underwent investigation for MDR-TB, and the results of the culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST). Methods: A cross sectional record review of TB patients registered for treatment between July-December 2011. Results: Of 19,236 TB patients registered, 409 (2%) fulfilled the criteria of presumptive MDR-TB; of these, 187 (46%) were examined for culture. This proportion was higher among relapse, failure, return after default (RAD) and non-converters at 3 months of new smear positive TB patients (>60%) as compared to non-converters at 2 months of new TB cases (<20%). Nearly two thirds (n = 113) of the samples were culture positive; of these, three-fourth (n = 85) grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBc) and one-fourth (n = 28) grew non-tuberculous Mycobacteria. DST results were available for 96% of the MTBc isolates. Overall, 21 patients were diagnosed as MDR-TB (all diagnosed among retreatment TB cases and none from non-converters) and all of them were initiated on MDR-TB treatment. Conclusion: There is a need to strengthen mechanisms for linking patients with presumptive MDR-TB to culture centers. The policy of testing non-converters for culture and DST needs to be reviewed.		
10.1186_1752_153X_7_72	Sustained release formulation of an anti-tuberculosis drug based on para-amino salicylic acid-zinc layered hydroxide nanocomposite	Background: Tuberculosis (TB), is caused by the bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its a threat to humans since centuries. Depending on the type of TB, its treatment can last for 6-24 months which is a major cause for patients non-compliance and treatment failure. Many adverse effects are associated with the currently available TB medicines, and there has been no new anti-tuberculosis drug on the market for more than 50 year, as the drug development is very lengthy and budget consuming process. Development of the biocompatible nano drug delivery systems with the ability to minimize the side effects of the drugs, protection of the drug from enzymatic degradation. And most importantly the drug delivery systems which can deliver the drug at target site would increase the therapeutic efficacy. Nanovehicles with their tendency to release the drug in a sustained manner would result in the bioavalibilty of the drugs in the body for a longer period of time and this would reduce the dosing frequency in drug administration. The biocompatible nanovehicles with the properties like sustained release of drug of the target site, protection of the drug from physio-chemical degradation, reduction in dosing frequency, and prolong bioavailability of drug in the body would result in the shortening of the treatment duration. All of these factors would improve the patient compliance with chemotherapy of TB. Result: An anti-tuberculosis drug, 4-amino salicylic acid (4-ASA) was successfully intercalated into the interlamellae of zinc layered hydroxide (ZLH) via direct reaction with zinc oxide suspension. The X-ray diffraction patterns and FTIR analyses indicate that the molecule was successfully intercalated into the ZLH interlayer space with an average basal spacing of 24 angstrom. Furthermore, TGA and DTG results show that the drug 4-ASA is stabilized in the interlayers by electrostatic interaction. The release of 4-ASA from the nanocomposite was found to be in a sustained manner. The nanocomposite treated with normal 3T3 cells shows it reduces cell viability in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Conclusions: Sustained release formulation of the nanocomposite, 4-ASA intercalated into zinc layered hydroxides, with its ease of preparation, sustained release of the active and less-toxic to the cell is a step forward for a more patient-friendly chemotherapy of Tuberculosis.

10.1371_journal.pone.0058817	Serious Treatment Related Adverse Drug Reactions amongst Anti-Retroviral Naive MDR-TB Patients	Background: Globally treatment outcomes for multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) remain poor and this is compounded by high drug toxicity. Little is known about the influence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) on treatment outcomes in South Africa. Methods: We evaluated the impact of severe ADRs among a prospective cohort of MDR-TB patients in South Africa (2000-2004). The HIV-infected study participants were anti-retroviral naive. Results: Of 2,079 patients enrolled, 1,390 (66.8%) were included in this analysis based on known HIV test results (39.1% HIV-infected). At least one severe ADR was reported in 83 (6.9%) patients with ototoxicity being the most frequent ADR experienced (38.9%). Conclusions: We found that being HIV-infected but antiretroviral naive did not increase occurrence of SADRs in patients on second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. Early screening and proactive management of ADRs in this patient population is essential, especially given the rollout of decentralized care and the potential for overlapping toxicity of concomitant MDR-TB and HIV treatment.

10.9738_INTSURG_D_12_00004.1	Drug Susceptibility Testing Guided Treatment for Drug-Resistant Spinal Tuberculosis: A Retrospective Analysis of 19 Patients	Spinal tuberculosis is the most common manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. However, there have been few reports on the topic of drug-resistant spinal tuberculosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of treatment with a combination of surgery and individual chemotherapy guided by drug susceptibility testing for drug-resistant spinal tuberculosis. We retrospectively analyzed 19 patients with drug-resistant spinal tuberculosis. After surgery, individual chemotherapy was tailored for each patient according to his or her drug resistance profile and previous history of chemotherapy. The patients were followed up clinically and radiologically for an average period of 36 months. Among 19 drug-resistant spinal tuberculosis cases, 16 were multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), and 3 were non-MDR-TB. The patients with MDR-TB and non-MDR-TB had undergone previous chemotherapy for an average of 12.50 +/- 2.00 months (0-55 months) and 5.50 +/- 1.20 months (0-60 months), respectively. A total of 16 patients underwent open operations, and the other 3 had percutaneous drainage and local chemotherapy. Patients received individual chemotherapy for an average of 24 months postoperatively. All patients had been cured at the final follow-up. Drug-resistant spinal tuberculosis is mainly acquired through previous irregular chemotherapy and the spread of drug-resistant strains. Treatment with a combination of surgery and individual chemotherapy is feasible in the treatment of severe complications and the prevention of acquired drug resistance.

10.4103_0377_4929.118681	Evaluation of GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay for rapid detection of drug susceptibility testing of multi-drug resistance tuberculosis in Northern India	Background: The problem of multi-drug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is growing in several hotspots throughout the world. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of MDR-TB is crucial to facilitate early treatment and to reduce its spread in the community. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the new, novel GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay for rapid detection of drug susceptibility testing (DST) of MDR-TB cases in Northern India. Materials and Methods: A total of 550 specimens were collected from highly suspected drug resistant from pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB cases. All the specimens were processed by ZiehlNeelsen staining, culture, differentiation by the GenoType (R) CM assay, fi rst line DST using BacT/ALERT 3D system and GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay. The concordance of the GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay was calculated in comparison with conventional DST results. Results: Overall the sensitivity for detection of rifampicin, isoniazid and MDR-TB resistance by GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay was 98.0%, 98.4% and 98.2% respectively. Out of 55 MDR-TB strains, 45 (81.8%), 52 (94.5%) and 17 (30.9%) strains showed mutation in rpoB, katG and inhA genes respectively (P < 0.05). The most prominent mutations in rpoB, katG and inhA genes were; 37 (67.3%) in S531L, 52 (94.5%) in S315T1 and 11 (20%) in C15T regions respectively (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated a high concordance between the GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay resistance patterns and those were observed by conventional DST with good sensitivity, specifi city with short turnaround times and to control new cases of MDR-TB in countries with a high prevalence of MDR-TB.

10.1177_0049475513490421	Multi-drug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Kassala State, Eastern Sudan	This study investigates the prevalence of drug resistance and mutations in rpoB gene among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Kassala State, Sudan. In a cross-sectional study during 2011, sputum specimens (n=90) were examined microscopically and grown cultures were identified by analysing IS6110 insertion sequence. Antimicrobial sensitivity and mutations in the rpoB gene were determined. Of the 90 specimens found which were positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), 65 (72.2%) showed growth of mycobacteria. Sixty (66.7%) of these were M. tuberculosis, 5 (5.6%) were rapidly growing mycobacteria and 10 (11.1%) revealed no growth. Of the 60 M. tuberculosis, 31 (51.7%) were drug resistant, including 18 multidrug resistant TB (30%), and 15 (83.3%) demonstrated mutations in the rpoB gene. Isoniazid and rifampicin revealed the highest resistance rates (64.5%, 61.3%, respectively). In conclusion, drug resistance M. tuberculosis in Kassala State was high (30%) and was found to be mainly (83.3%) due to mutations in the rpoB gene.

10.4103_0255_0857.115225	A rapid and low-cost microscopic observation drug susceptibility assay for detecting TB and MDR-TB among individuals infected by HIV in South India	Background: The converging epidemics of HIV and tuberculosis (TB) pose one of the greatest public health challenges of our time. Rapid diagnosis of TB is essential in view of its infectious nature, high burden of cases, and emergence of drug resistance. Objective: The purpose of this present study was to evaluate the feasibility of implementing the microscopic observation drug susceptibility (MODS) assay, a novel assay for the diagnosis of TB and multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) directly from sputum specimens, in the Indian setting. Materials and Methods: This study involved a cross-sectional, blinded assessment of the MODS assay on 1036 suspected cases of pulmonary TB in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients against the radiometric method, BD-BACTEC TB 460 system. Results: Overall, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the MODS assay in detecting MTB among TB suspected patients were 89.1%, 99.1%, 94.2%, 95.8%, respectively. In addition, in the diagnosis of drug-resistant TB, the MODS assay was 84.2% sensitive for those specimens reporting MDR, 87% sensitivity for those specimens reporting INH mono-resistance, and 100% sensitive for specimens reporting RIF mono-resistance. The median time to detection of TB in the MODS assay versus BACTEC was 9 versus 21 days (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Costing 5 to 10 times lesser than the automated culture methods, the MODS assay has the potential clinical utility as a simple and rapid method. It could be effectively used as an alternative method for diagnosing TB and detection of MDR-TB in a timely and affordable way in resource-limited settings.

10.1097_QAI.0b013e31828175ed	Adverse Events in an Integrated Home-Based Treatment Program for MDR-TB and HIV in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa	Most patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in South Africa are HIV-infected, but the safety and tolerability of cotreatment are unknown. The authors reviewed all adverse events (AEs) for patients with MDR-TB in a home-based treatment program in rural KwaZulu-Natal. Of 91 MDR-TB patients, 74 (81%) were HIV-positive and receiving antiretroviral therapy. AEs were common, but most were mild and did not require therapy modification. The most common severe AEs were hypothyroidism (36%) and psychosis (5%). Patients receiving concurrent antiretroviral therapy did not experience AEs more frequently than those on MDR-TB therapy alone. Concurrent treatment for MDR-TB/HIV can be safely administered in a home-based care setting.

10.1183_09031936.00071212	Transmission of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in a metropolitan city	Multidrug-resistant (MDR)- tuberculosis (TB) and extensively drug resistant (XDR)-TB reportedly lead to increased household transmission. This is a retrospective cohort study of active TB occurring among household contacts exposed to MDR-TB. Of 704 contacts in 246 households, initial screening identified 12 (1.7%) TB cases (prevalent cases) and 17 (2.4%) contacts that subsequently developed active TB (secondary cases) after a median (range) duration of 17 (5-62.5) months. Eight prevalent cases and three secondary cases had MDR-TB. TB incidence rates per 100 000 person-years were 254.9 overall and 45.0 for MDR-TB. XDR-TB in the index MDR-TB patient significantly increased the odds of identifying a prevalent TB case to 4.8 (95% CI 1.02-22.5), and the hazard of finding a secondary TB case to 4.7 (95% CI 1.7-13.5). Molecular fingerprinting confirmed household transmission of MDR-TB. Of 20 retrievable isolates from 27 XDR-TB index cases, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis showed clustering among 13 (65%), with 11 (55%) due to recent transmission by n-1 method and an identifiable household source in only three (27.2%) of the 11 cases. XDR-TB relative to MDR-TB significantly increases household transmission of TB, probably reflecting prolonged/higher infectivity, and indicating a need for prolonged household surveillance. XDR-TB may largely transmit outside of the household settings.

10.1590_0074_0276108022013006	A population-based study of first and second-line drug-resistant tuberculosis in a high-burden area of the Mexico/United States border	The resistance of 139 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates from the city of Monterrey, Northeast Mexico, to first and second-line anti-TB drugs was analysed. A total of 73 isolates were susceptible and 66 were resistant to anti-TB drugs. Monoresistance to streptomycin, isoniazid (INH) and ethambutol was observed in 29 cases. Resistance to INH was found in 52 cases and in 29 cases INH resistance was combined with resistance to two or three drugs. A total of 24 isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR) resistant to at least INH and rifampicin and 11 MDR cases were resistant to five drugs. The proportion of MDR-TB among new TB cases in our target population was 0.72% (1/139 cases). The proportion of MDR-TB among previously treated cases was 25.18% (35/139 cases). The 13 polyresistant and 24 MDR isolates were assayed against the following seven second-line drugs: amikacin (AMK), kanamycin (KAN), capreomycin (CAP), clofazimine (CLF), ethionamide (ETH), ofloxacin (OFL) and cycloserine (CLS). Resistance to CLF, OFL or CLS was not observed. Resistance was detected to ETH (10.80%) and to AMK (2.70%), KAN (2.70%) and CAP (2.70%). One isolate of MDR with primary resistance was also resistant to three second-line drugs. Monterrey has a high prevalence of MDR-TB among previously treated cases and extensively drug-resistant-MTB strains may soon appear.	tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; first and second-line drug resistance	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; ASSAY; SUSCEPTIBILITY; MEXICO
10.1016_j.mimet.2013.01.008	Combining COLD-PCR and high-resolution melt analysis for rapid detection of low-level, rifampin-resistant mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) remains a serious threat to public health. Mutational analysis of the gene encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoB) is an established and widely used surrogate marker for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The rpoB-based drug-resistant assay requires relatively less time to detect drug resistance in M. tuberculosis, yet it fails to detect low-level mutations in wild-type DNA. Here, we describe a low-level mutation detection method that combines co-amplification at lower denaturation temperature polymerase chain reaction (COLD-PCR) with high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis, aimed at detecting low-level, rifampin-resistant mutations in M. tuberculosis. Compared to conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), dilution experiments demonstrated a four- to eightfold improvement in selectivity using COLD-PCR/HRM to detect low-level, rifampin-resistant mutations. The mutation detection limit of conventional PCR/HRM was approximately 20%, whereas COLD-PCR/HRM had a mutation detection limit of 2.5%. Using traditional PCR/HRM and DNA sequencing, we found rpoB mutation in 110 rifampin-resistant isolates. The use of COLD-PCR/HRM allowed us to detect 10 low-level, rifampin-resistant mutations in 16 additional drug-resistant isolates. The sensitivity of COLD-PCR/HRM (95.2%) is significantly higher than that of PCR/HRM (87.3%). Our findings demonstrate that combined use of COLD-PCR with HRM can provide a sensitivity of at least 5% in detecting rpoB-mutated populations in a wild-type background, decreasing the delay in drug-resistant TB diagnosis and leading to faster, cheaper, more efficient, and more personalized antibiotic treatment, especially for low-level drug resistance mutations among the excess wild-type DNA.

10.5588_ijtld.12.0286	Multidrug resistance in new tuberculosis patients: burden and implications	In 2010, 30 countries with anti-tuberculosis drug resistance surveillance data were each estimated to have more than 700 multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases among their notified TB cases. New TB patients comprised a median of 54% (interquartile range 45-67) of the MDR-TB cases. The occurrence of MDR-TB in a new TB patient is a warning sign that MDR-TB is spreading in a community. While MDR-TB case-finding efforts should first prioritize previously treated patients, reaching universal access requires rapidly adding other risk groups, and then all new TB patients. Epidemiological data as presented in this paper can help inform country scale-up plans.	drug susceptibility testing; case finding; universal access; tuberculosis	ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUG-RESISTANCE; SURVEILLANCE
10.5588_ijtld.12.0167	Drug resistance in Mexico: results from the National Survey on Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis	OBJECTIVE: To present estimations obtained from a population-level survey conducted in Mexico of prevalence rates of mono-, poly- and multidrug-resistant strains among newly diagnosed cases of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), as well as the main factors associated with multidrug resistance (combined resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin). DESIGN: Study data came from the National Survey on TB Drug Resistance (ENTB-2008), a nationally representative survey conducted during 2008-2009 in nine states with a stratified cluster sampling design. Samples were obtained for all newly diagnosed cases of pulmonary TB in selected sites. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed for anti-tuberculosis drugs. RESULTS: DST results were obtained for 75% of the cases. Of these, 82.2% (95%CI 79.5-84.7) were susceptible to all drugs. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was estimated at 2.8% (95%CI 1.9-4.0). MDR-TB was associated with previous treatment (OR 3.3, 95%CI 1.1-9.4). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of drug resistance is relatively low in Mexico. ENTB-2008 can be used as a baseline for future follow-up of drug resistance.	pulmonary tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; epidemiology	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; RISK-FACTORS; PREVALENCE
10.5588_ijtld.12.0481	Successful management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis under programme conditions in the Dominican Republic	SETTING: The Dominican Republic is a high-incidence area for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB; 6.6% of initial cases). Standardised treatment regimens for MDR-TB may be a potential solution. OBJECTIVE: To present the effectiveness of standard regimens under routine national conditions. DESIGN: We reviewed all MDR-TB patients treated under routine conditions from 29 August 2006 to 30 June 2010, showing interim and final outcomes. Patients were treated with regimens that were standardised or individualised based on previously received second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. RESULTS: Population description and culture conversion data are reported for the 289 MDR-TB patients. The median patient age was 31 years. Most had failed first-line treatment (72.6%). Culture negativity was obtained within 4 months (median 2 months) in 78.6%. Among the 150 patients treated between 2006 and 2008, 74% had favourable results on standardised and 66% on individualised regimens (P = 0.211). The efficacy of the standardised and individualised regimens was respectively 92.8% and 81% (P = 0.056). The relapse rate was approximately 1%. A median of five drug side effects occurred per patient. More than 2 months to culture conversion and bilateral cavitation on chest X-ray were found to be unfavourable outcome risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Standardised MDR-TB regimens may be effective at the national level, even in resource-poor settings.

10.5588_ijtld.12.0703	Converging risk factors but no association between HIV infection and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Kazakhstan	SETTING: Kazakhstan is a country with a low HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune-deficiency syndrome) burden, but a high prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). METHODS: We describe the epidemiology of multidrug resistance and HIV among TB patients, using the 2007-2011 national electronic TB register. RESULTS: HIV test results were available for 97.2% of TB patients. HIV prevalence among TB patients increased from 0.6% in 2007 to 1.5% in 2011. Overall, 41.6% of patients had a positive smear at diagnosis, 38.6% a positive culture and 51.7% either a positive smear or culture. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) results were available for 92.7% of culture-positive cases. Socio-economic factors independently associated with both HIV and MDR-TB were urban residency, drug use, homelessness and a history of incarceration. In adjusted analysis, HIV positivity was not associated with MDR-TB (OR 1.0, 95%CI 0.86-1.2). Overall, among TB patients with DST and HIV test results available, 65.0% were positive for neither HIV nor MDR-TB, 33.5% only for MDR-TB, 0.9% only for HIV and 0.6% for both HIV and MDR-TB. Among injection drug users, 12.5% were positive for HIV and MDR-TB. CONCLUSION: We showed increasing HIV prevalence among TB patients in Kazakhstan. HIV was not an independent risk factor for MDR-TB, but risk factors were largely overlapping and we did identify subgroups at particular risk of HIV-MDR-TB co-infection, notably drug users. Enhanced efforts are necessary to provide care to these socially vulnerable populations.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; MDR-TB; HIV; Kazakhstan	DRUG-RESISTANCE; SURVEILLANCE
10.1093_tropej_fms065	Trends in Childhood Tuberculosis in Zambia: A Situation Analysis	Objectives: To ascertain childhood tuberculosis (TB) trends, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection rates and multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) prevalence rates in Zambia. Methods: A retrospective review of Zambian annual TB notification data and National TB Programme reports for a 7 year period (2004-2011). TB trends were stratified by age and HIV status. Results: The total number of children notified during this period with all forms of TB was 40 976. A total of 2670 of 40 976 (6%) were smear-positive cases. Notification rates of all forms of childhood TB show a decline in trends from 135 per 100 000 population in 2004, to 69 per 100 000 population in 2011. Conclusions: Childhood TB is an important but neglected problem in Zambia highlighted by the fact that no data exists on HIV co-infection and MDR-TB. Strengthening of the National TB Programme and diagnostics services/algorithms are required to accurately define the TB burden, HIV co-infection and MDR-TB rates in children in Zambia.

10.1128_AAC.02191_12	Aminoglycoside Cross-Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Due to Mutations in the 5 ' Untranslated Region of whiB7	Since the discovery of streptomycin's bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, aminoglycosides have been utilized to treat tuberculosis (TB). Today, the aminoglycosides kanamycin and amikacin are used to treat multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB, and resistance to any of the second-line injectable antibiotics, including kanamycin, amikacin, or capreomycin, is a defining characteristic of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. Resistance to kanamycin and streptomycin is thought to be due to the acquisition of unlinked chromosomal mutations. However, we identified eight independent mutations in the 5' untranslated region of the transcriptional activator whiB7 that confer low-level resistance to both aminoglycosides. The mutations lead to 23- to 145-fold increases in whiB7 transcripts and subsequent increased expression of both eis (Rv2416c) and tap (Rv1258c). Increased expression of eis confers kanamycin resistance in these mutants, while increased expression of tap, which encodes an efflux pump, is a previously uncharacterized mechanism of low-level streptomycin resistance. Additionally, high-level resistance to streptomycin arose at a much higher frequency in whiB7 mutants than in a wild-type (WT) strain. Although whiB7 is typically associated with intrinsic antibiotic resistance in M. tuberculosis, these data suggest that mutations in an uncharacterized regulatory region of whiB7 contribute to cross-resistance against clinically used second-line antibiotics. As drug resistance continues to develop and spread, understanding the mechanisms and molecular basis of antibiotic resistance is critical for the development of rapid molecular tests to diagnose drug-resistant TB strains and ultimately for designing regimens to treat drug-resistant cases of TB.

10.1016_j.jinf.2012.09.002	Hearing loss in children treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Objective: The aminoglycosides and polypeptides are vital drugs for the management of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB). Both classes of drug cause hearing loss. We aimed to determine the extent of hearing loss in children treated for MDR-TB. Methods: In this retrospective study, children (<15 years) admitted to Brooklyn Chest Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa, from January 2009 until December 2010, were included if treated for MDR-TB with injectable drugs. Hearing was assessed and classified using audiometry and otoacoustic emissions. Results: Ninety-four children were included (median age: 43 months). Of 93 tested, 28 (30%) were HIV-infected. Twenty-three (24%) children had hearing loss. Culture-confirmed, as opposed to presumed, diagnosis of TB was a risk factor for hearing loss (OR: 4.12; 95% CI: 1.13e15.0; p = 0.02). Seven of 11 (64%) children classified as having hearing loss using audiometry had progression of hearing loss after finishing the injectable drug.

10.1007_s10156_012_0490_8	Frequency of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) among re-treatment cases in NIDCH, Dhaka, Bangladesh	Emergence of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) in Bangladesh has increased as a result of the inadequate management of TB-infected individuals. The present study attempted to detect the frequency of multidrug resistance (MDR) among the TB patients categorically from relapse, category I failure, category II failure, and return after default category I and II cases, using the conventional drug susceptibility test. Among 100 sputum specimens from all four categories, 81 and 84 positive cases were identified under light-emitting diode fluorescence microscope and the Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) culture method, respectively. Of 84 culture-positive cases, elevated resistance was observed against isoniazid (89.3 %) and rifampicin (91.7 %) compared to that against streptomycin (53.6 %) and ethambutol (47.7 %). Resistance against ofloxacin, gatifloxacin, and kanamycin was 8.3, 5.9, and 2.4 %, consecutively. Fifty-nine cases were found to be MDR-TB. Two of these cases, which showed resistance against kanamycin and ofloxacin, were further identified as XDR. The proportion of XDR cases was more likely to be in the return after default category I and II cases.

10.1093_cid_cis1008	Aggressive Regimens for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Reduce Recurrence	Background. Recurrent tuberculosis disease occurs within 2 years in as few as 1% and as many as 29% of individuals successfully treated for multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis. A better understanding of treatment-related factors associated with an elevated risk of recurrent tuberculosis after cure is urgently needed to optimize MDR tuberculosis therapy. Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among adults successfully treated for MDR tuberculosis in Peru. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to examine whether receipt of an aggressive MDR tuberculosis regimen for >= 18 months following sputum conversion from positive to negative was associated with a reduced rate of recurrent tuberculosis. Results. Among 402 patients, the median duration of follow-up was 40.5 months (interquartile range, 21.2-53.4). Receipt of an aggressive MDR tuberculosis regimen for >= 18 months following sputum conversion was associated with a lower risk of recurrent tuberculosis (hazard ratio, 0.40 [95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.96]; P = .04). A baseline diagnosis of diabetes mellitus also predicted recurrent tuberculosis (hazard ratio, 10.47 [ 95% confidence interval, 2.17-50.60]; P = .004). Conclusions. Individuals who received an aggressive MDR tuberculosis regimen for >= 18 months following sputum conversion experienced a lower rate of recurrence after cure. Efforts to ensure that an aggressive regimen is accessible to all patients with MDR tuberculosis, such as minimization of sequential ineffective regimens, expanded drug access, and development of new MDR tuberculosis compounds, are critical to reducing tuberculosis recurrence in this population. Patients with diabetes mellitus should be carefully managed during initial treatment and followed closely for recurrent disease.	resistance; recurrence; relapse; Peru; regimen	TREATMENT OUTCOMES; DIABETES-MELLITUS; MDR-TB; PERU; METAANALYSIS; RETREATMENT; COHORT; INDIA; RISK; LIMA
10.1186_1471_2334_13_137	Prevalence of multidrug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from HIV seropositive and seronegative patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in north India	Background: Multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively-drug resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) are a serious threat to the national TB control programs of developing countries, and the situation is further worsened by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic. The literature regarding MDR/XDR-TB is, however, scanty from most parts of India. We carried out this study to assess the prevalence of MDR/XDR-TB in new and previously treated cases of pulmonary TB and in HIV seropositive and seronegative patients. Methods: Sputum and blood specimens were obtained from 2100 patients suspected of pulmonary tuberculosis and subjected to sputum microscopy and culture for TB, and HIV serology at our tertiary care centre in north India. The culture positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were subjected to drug susceptibility testing (DST) for first line anti-tuberculosis drugs, and the MDR isolates were further subjected to second line DST. Various parameters of the patients' were analyzed viz. clinical presentation, radiology, previous treatment history, demographic and socioeconomic data and microbiology results. Results: Of the 2100 patients, sputum specimens of 256 were smear positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), 271 (12.9%) grew Mycobacterium spp., and M. tuberculosis was isolated in 219 (10.42%). Of the 219 patients infected with M. tuberculosis, 20.1% (44/219) were found to be seropositive for HIV. Overall, MDR-TB was observed in 17.4% (39/219) isolates. There were 121 newly diagnosed and 98 previously treated patients, of which MDR-TB was found to be associated with 9.9% (12/121) and 27.6% (27/98) cases respectively. There was significantly higher association of MDR-TB (12/44, 27.3%) with HIV seropositive patients as compared to HIV seronegative patients (27/175, 15.4%) after controlling previous treatment status, age, and sex (odd's ratio, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.000-5.350]; p-value, 0.05). No XDR-TB was found among the MDR-TB isolates. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated a high prevalence of drug resistance amongst pulmonary TB isolates of M. tuberculosis from north India as compared to the WHO estimates for India in 2010, though this could possibly be attributed to the clustering of more serious or referred cases at our tertiary care centre. The prevalence of MDR-TB in HIV seropositive patients was significantly higher than seronegative individuals. The study emphasizes the need to monitor the trends of drug resistance in TB in various populations in order to timely implement appropriate interventions to curb the menace of MDR-TB.

10.1371_journal.pone.0058664	Aggressive Regimens for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Decrease All-Cause Mortality	Rationale: A better understanding of the composition of optimal treatment regimens for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is essential for expanding universal access to effective treatment and for developing new therapies for MDR-TB. Analysis of observational data may inform the definition of an optimized regimen. Objectives: This study assessed the impact of an aggressive regimen-one containing at least five likely effective drugs, including a fluoroquinolone and injectable-on treatment outcomes in a large MDR-TB patient cohort. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients treated in a national outpatient program in Peru between 1999 and 2002. We examined the association between receiving an aggressive regimen and the rate of death. Measurements and Main Results: In total, 669 patients were treated with individualized regimens for laboratory-confirmed MDR-TB. Isolates were resistant to a mean of 5.4 (SD 1.7) drugs. Cure or completion was achieved in 66.1% (442) of patients; death occurred in 20.8% (139). Patients who received an aggressive regimen were less likely to die (crude hazard ratio [HR]: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.44,0.89), compared to those who did not receive such a regimen. This association held in analyses adjusted for comorbidities and indicators of severity (adjusted HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.43,0.93). Conclusions: The aggressive regimen is a robust predictor of MDR-TB treatment outcome. TB policy makers and program directors should consider this standard as they design and implement regimens for patients with drug-resistant disease. Furthermore, the aggressive regimen should be considered the standard background regimen when designing randomized trials of treatment for drug-resistant TB.

10.7883_yoken.66.89	"A Reduction in Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance after the Implementation of the National ""STOP TB"" Program in Central Taiwan, 2003-2007"	"The aim of this study was to determine the performance of the national ""STOP TB"" program in central Taiwan during 2003-2007 by examining trends in the combined drug resistance to first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs among clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. Using 4,819 clinical M. tuberculosis isolates obtained from two mycobacteriology referral laboratories, the resistance to drugs was measured and analyzed along with the treatment outcomes in notified TB patients. The proportion of isolates showing total resistance and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates were 17.7% and 3.67%, respectively. More number of MDR-TB isolates showed high-level resistance to isoniazid (84.18%) and streptomycin (SM) (30.51%); low-level resistance to ethambutol (EMB) (61.58%), SM (41.81%), and pyrazinamide (66.1%); and resistance to ofloxacin (30.4%). However, fewer isolates showed high-level resistance to EMB (19.77%), levofloxacin (17.9%), moxifloxacin (19.6%), kanamycin (8.9%), amikacin (8.9%), and capreomycin (8.9%). Of these MDR-TB isolates, 7.1% were extensively drug-resistant. Trends in combined drug resistance to all the first-line anti-TB drugs and the incidence of MDR-TB were stable during the 2 years (2003-2004) before the implementation of the national ""STOP TB"" program. After the ""STOP TB"" program, there were significant declines in the incidence of MDR-TB during 2005-2007 in central Taiwan as well as improved TB-treatment outcomes. Thus, the national ""STOP TB"" program had a significant positive impact on TB control in central Taiwan."

10.1016_j.bjid.2012.10.011	Multidrug resistant tuberculosis versus non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections: a CT-scan challenge	Introduction: Clinical, laboratory and imaging findings in patients with multidrug resistant-tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and non-tuberculosis mycobacterium (NTM) are similar, and the majority of these patients present with positive smear for Acid Fast Bacilli (ADB) and no response to first line anti-TB treatment, so sputum culture and PCR are necessary, especially in NTM. Objective: In this study we evaluate more details of imaging findings to help earlier diagnosis of pathogens. Materials and methods: 66 patients with positive smear for AFB and no response to first line anti-TB drugs were divided into two groups by PCR and culture: MDR-TB (43 patients) and NTM (23 patients). Age, sex, history of anti-TB treatment, smoking and CT-scan findings (parenchymal, pleural and mediastinal variables) by details and lobar distribution were analyzed. Results: Mean age of NTM patients was slightly higher (52 versus 45) and there is no significant difference in sex and smoking. In MDR-TB group, history of anti-TB treatment and evidence of chronic pulmonary disease such as calcified and fibrodestructed parenchyma, volume loss and pleural thickening were higher significantly. Cavities in MDR-TB were thick-wall in the background of consolidation, while NTM cavities were more thin-walled with adjacent satellite nodules in same segment or lobe. Prevalence of bronchiectasis was similar in both groups, while bronchiectasis in MDR-TB group was in fibrobronchiectatic background in upper lobes, and in NTM group the distribution was more uniform with slightly middle lobes predominance. Prevalence and distribution of nodular infiltrations were similar more in Tree in Buds and scattered pattern. Calcified or non-calcified lymph nodes and also pleural changes were more frequent in MDR-TB but prevalence of lymphadenopathy was mildly higher in NTM. Conclusion: A check-list with multiple variables is helpful for differentiation between the two groups. (C) 2013 Elsevier Editora Ltda. All rights reserved.

10.1016_j.bjid.2013.01.005	Tuberculosis in Brazil: last ten years analysis-2001-2010	Objective: To describe tuberculosis epidemiological situation in Brazil, as well as program performance indicators in 2001-2010 period, and discuss the relationship between changes observed and control measures implemented in this century first decade. Methods: It is a descriptive study, data source was the Information System for Notifiable Diseases (Sinan), Mortality Information System (SIM), Unified Health System Hospital Information System (SIH/SUS) and TB Multidrug-resistant Surveillance System (MDR-TB/SS). Indicators analyzed were organized into four major groups: TB control program (TCP) coverage and case detection; morbidity; treatment and TCP performance; and mortality. Results: In the years analyzed there was a decrease in the number of new cases and incidence rate, mortality reduction (relative and absolute), and improvement in TB detection and diagnosis, as well in TB/HIV coinfection and drug resistance. However, little progress was found in contact investigation, diagnosis in primary care and TB cure rate. Discussion: Results showed many advances in tuberculosis control in the 10 years analyzed, but it also points to serious obstacles that need to be solved so Brazil can eliminate tuberculosis as a public health problem.

10.1016_j.bjid.2013.01.007	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Despite the efforts made worldwide to reduce the number of cases of drug-susceptible tuberculosis, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) constitutes an important public health issue. Around 440,000 new cases of MDR-TB are estimated annually, although in 2008 only 7% of these (29,423 cases) were notified. The laboratory tests for diagnosing resistance may be phenotypic (based on culture growth in the presence of drugs) or genotypic (i.e. identification of the presence of mutations that confer resistance). The urgent need for a rapid means of detecting resistance to anti-TB drugs has resulted in the development of many genotypic methods over recent years. The treatment of MDR-TB is expensive, complex, prolonged (18-24 months) and associated with a higher incidence of adverse reactions. Some basic principles must be observed when prescribing an adequate treatment regimen for MDR-TB: (a) the association of at least four drugs (three of which should not have been used previously); (b) use of a fluoroquinolone; and (c) use of an injectable anti-TB drug. In Brazil, the therapeutic regimen for MDR-TB has been standardized and consists of five drugs: terizidone, levofloxacin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and an aminoglycoside (streptomycin or amikacin). Pulmonary resection is an important tool in the coadjuvant treatment of MDR-TB. While a recent meta-analysis revealed an average cure rate of MDR-TB of 69%, clinical studies are currently being conducted with new drugs and with drugs already available on the market but with a new indication for TB, with encouraging results that will enable more effective treatment regimens to be planned in the future.

10.1016_j.meegid.2012.12.024	Genetic diversity among multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in Mexico	Tuberculosis is an important public health problem in Mexico. However, limited information about the genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains circulating in the country is available. In this work, 109 multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis isolates collected in 23 different states of Mexico in 2003 were retrospectively characterized by spoligoping and MIRU-VNTRs. All isolates, except for a single cluster containing two gtrains (subcluster El), were split when information from the 12-loci MIRUs and spoligo-pattern was simultaneously analyzed. The discriminative power of 12-loci MIRU-VNTR and spoligotyping, by the Hunter-Gaston index, were 0.9998 and 0.9011, respectively. These findings suggest that almost all cases were epidemiologically unrelated. Instead, the genetic variations observed among these strains are suggestive of emergence of acquired drug-resistance during the course of treatment. The results suggest a high degree of genetic variability and a high frequency of SIT53 (T1 family) spoligotype among the MDR M. tuberculosis isolates included in the study. Published by Elsevier B.V.

10.7196_SAMJ.6266	Tuberculosis in medical doctors - a study of personal experiences and attitudes	Background. The concurrent TB and HIV epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa place all healthcare workers (HCWs) at increased risk of exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Aim. This study explores personal experiences, attitudes and perceptions of medical doctors following treatment for TB within the healthcare system. Method. Sixty-two medical doctors who were diagnosed with and treated for TB during 2007 - 2009 agreed to participate and complete a semi-structured questionnaire. Results. The response rate was 64.5% (N=40). The mean age of participants was 33.7 years (standard deviation +/- 10.6). A correct diagnosis of TB was made within 7 days of clinical presentation in 20% of participants, and was delayed beyond 3 weeks in 52.5%. Non-routine special investigations and procedures were performed in 26 participants. Complications following invasive procedures were reported by 8 participants. Multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) was diagnosed in 4 participants. Nineteen considered defaulting on their treatment because of drug side-effects. The majority (n=36) expressed concerns regarding lack of infection control at the workplace, delays in TB diagnosis and negative attitudes of senior medical colleagues and administrators. Ninety per cent of participants indicated that their personal illness experiences had positively changed their professional approach to patients in their current practice. Conclusion. The inappropriate delays in diagnosis in a large number of participants, coupled with a number of negative personal perceptions towards their treatment, are cause for concern. The results further amplify the need for improved educational and awareness programmes among all healthcare personnel (including hospital administrators), adherence to national health guidelines, effective infection control measures, pre- and post-employment screening in all HCWs> and changes in attitudes on the part of senior medical colleagues and administrators.

10.4161_hv.23229	The study of novel DNA vaccines against tuberculosis Induction of pathogen-specific CTL in the mouse and monkey models of tuberculosis	Results: HSP 65 + IL-12 DNA vaccine showed higher protective efficacy compared with BCG in both mouse and monkey models of TB. It induced the TB-specific CTL in the mouse model of TB, while little level of activity was observed after the injection of BCG. It also showed strong therapeutic efficacy against MDR-TB. In the monkey model, the vaccine augmented the production of IFN-gamma. and IL-2 from PBL and the therapeutic effect was correlated with the level of IL-2. We next evaluated the potential of DNA vaccine encoding a granulysin, which is an important defensive molecule expressed by human T cells. We found that granulysin-encoding vaccine induced the differentiation of the CTL in vitro and in vivo. It also showed therapeutic efficacy against TB in the monkey as well as the mouse model. The DNA vaccine encoding a Ksp37 also induced the TB-specific CTL in vitro and in vivo in the mouse model. It augmented the production of IL-2, IFN-gamma and IL-6 from T cells and spleen cells. A synergistic effect on the activation of the TB-specific CTL was observed by the combination of Ksp37 DNA vaccine with granulysin DNA vaccine. Purpose and Methods: Emergence of the multi-drug resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is a big problem in the world. We have developed novel TB vaccines [DNA vaccines encoding HSP 65 + IL-12, granulysin or killer-specific secretory protein of 37kDa (Ksp37)] using Hemagglutinating virus of Japan -envelope (HVJ-E). It is suggested that the activity of the TB-specific CTL is one of the most important factor for the resistance to TB and immunity for TB in chronic human TB disease. Therefore, we examined the level of activation of the TB-specific CTL after the administration of these vaccines. Conclusion: These data indicate that our novel vaccines (HSP 65 + IL-12 DNA, granulysin and Ksp37) have a capability to activate the TB-specific CTL and will be very strong protective and therapeutic vaccines against TB.	tuberculosis; vaccines against tuberculosis; CTL; monkeys; mice; HVJ-Envelope; HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA Vaccine; granulysin vaccine; Ksp37	HVJ ENVELOPE VECTOR; CD8(+) T-CELLS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; CYNOMOLGUS MONKEY; HEMAGGLUTINATING VIRUS; THERAPEUTIC VACCINE; GRANULYSIN; DIFFERENTIATION; LYMPHOCYTES; BCG
10.4161_hv.23230	Novel therapeutic vaccines [(HSP65+IL-12) DNA-, granulysin- and Ksp37-vaccine] against tuberculosis and synergistic effects in the combination with chemotherapy	Purpose: Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extremely drug resistant (XDR) TB are big problems in the world. We have developed novel TB therapeutic vaccines, HVJ-Envelope/HSP65 + IL-12 DNA vaccine (HSP65-vaccine), granulysin vaccine and killer specific secretory protein of 37kDa (Ksp37) vaccine. Results and Methods: HSP65 vaccine showed strong therapeutic effect against both MDR-TB and XDR-TB in mice. Intradermal immunization of HSP65-vaccine showed stronger therapeutic effect against TB than intramuscular or subcutaneous immunization. Furthermore, the synergistic therapeutic effect was observed when the vaccine was administrated in combination with Isoniazid (INH), which is a first line drug for chemotherapy. The combination of types of vaccines (HSP65- and granulysin-vaccines) also showed synergistic therapeutic effect. In the monkey model, granulysin-vaccine prolonged the survival period after the infection of TB and long-term survival was observed in vaccine-treated group. We examined the potential of two kinds of novel DNA vaccines (Ksp37-vaccine and granulysin-vaccine). Both vaccines augmented in vivo differentiation of CTL against TB. We measured the amount of Ksp37 protein in human serum and revealed that the level of Ksp37 protein of patients with tuberculosis was lower than that of healthy volunteers. Therefore, we established Ksp37 transgenic mice as well as granulysin transgenic mice to elucidate the function of those proteins. Both transgenic mice were resistant to TB infection. Conclusion: These data indicate the potential of combinational therapy; the combination of two DNA vaccines or combination of DNA vaccine with antibiotic drug. Thus, it will provide a novel strategy for the treatment of MDR-TB.	therapeutic vaccine against; tuberculosis; HSP65 DNA + IL-12 DNA vaccine; granulysin vaccine; Ksp37 vaccine; chemotherapy; Ksp37 transgenic mouse; synergistic therapeutic efficacy; MDR-TB; XDR-TB	HVJ ENVELOPE VECTOR; T-CELL-ACTIVATION; CYNOMOLGUS MONKEY; HEMAGGLUTINATING VIRUS; TRANSGENIC MICE; LYMPHOCYTES; DELIVERY; MODELS
10.1055_s_0031_1299578	Outcomes Following Surgery for Complicated Tuberculosis: Analysis of 108 Patients	Background Both incidence and complications of pleuropulmonary tuberculosis (TB) have increased due to recent increase of immunocompromising conditions. The aim of this study was to assess surgical outcomes in patients suffering from complicated pleuropulmonary TB. Methods This study included 108 patients with pleuropulmonary TB who underwent surgery. Age, sex, surgical indications, operative techniques, complications, mortality, and morbidity were evaluated. Results Male-female ratio was 1:11 with mean age of 40 years; 72.2 and 27.8% of the patients underwent surgery due to parenchymal and pleural complications. In the parenchymal group, the most common indication was parenchymal destruction (27.7%) and the most common procedure was lobectomy (50.9%). Out of 20 sputum smear-positive patients, 15 had multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and 5 had smear-positive open cavity. Overall 13 of the MDR-TB group and all smear-positive open cavity group became sputum-negative after the surgery. There were 13 patients with undiagnosed masses, among whom 3 patients had adenocarcinoma. In the pleural group, the most common surgical indication was empyema (13.8%) and the most common procedure was decortication and pleurectomy (13.8%). In the bronchopleural fistula group (6.4%), patients showed good results after surgery. There were 19.4% of patients who showed postoperative complications. The most common complication was residual space (5.5%). The main factors leading to major postoperative complications included positive preoperative sputum smear and history of immunocompromising condition. Mortality rate was 2.7%. Conclusion Considering the favorable results achieved by surgery in patients with pleuropulmonary TB, this treatment can be recommended for this group of patients.	pleuropulmonary tuberculosis; diagnosis; treatment; complication	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; SURGICAL INTERVENTION; RESISTANT
10.5588_ijtld.12.0355	Substandard and falsified anti-tuberculosis drugs: a preliminary field analysis	SETTING: Pharmacies in 19 cities in Angola, Brazil, China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, India (n = 3), Kenya, Nigeria, Russia, Rwanda, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia. OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality of the two main first-line anti-tuberculosis medicines, isoniazid and rifampicin, procured from private-sector pharmacies, to determine if substandard and falsified medicines are available and if they potentially contribute to drug resistance in cities in low- and middle-income countries. DESIGN: Local nationals procured 713 treatment packs from a selection of pharmacies in 19 cities. These samples were tested for quality using 1) thin-layer chromatography to analyze levels of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), and 2) disintegration testing. RESULTS: Of 713 samples tested, 9.1% failed basic quality testing for requisite levels of API or disintegration. The failure rate was 16.6% in Africa, 10.1% in India, and 3.9% in other middle-income countries. CONCLUSIONS: Substandard and falsified drugs are readily available in the private marketplace and probably contribute to anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in low- and middle-income countries. This issue warrants further investigation through large-scale studies of drug quality in all markets.

10.5588_ijtld.11.0670	Diabetes is associated with drug-resistant tuberculosis in Eastern Taiwan	We assessed the association between diabetes mellitus and drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). Among new patients, diabetes was significantly associated with any resistance to isoniazid excluding multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB; adjusted OR [aOR] 1.88, 95%CI 1.07-3.31), but not with MDR-TB (aOR 0.95, 95%CI 0.34-2.68). Among previously treated patients, diabetes was also significantly associated with INH resistance (aOR 6.76, 95%CI 1.53-29.98) but not with MDR-TB (aOR 1.52, 95%CI 0.59-3.95). We concluded that diabetes was associated with INH resistance and speculated that the sample size of retreatment cases was insufficient to confirm the association between diabetes and MDR-TB.	diabetes; isoniazid resistance; transmission; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	
10.5588_ijtld.12.0464	Risk factors and timing of default from treatment for non-multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Moldova	SETTING: The Republic of Moldova, in Eastern Europe, has among the highest reported nationwide proportions of tuberculosis (TB) patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) worldwide. Default has been associated with increased mortality and amplification of drug resistance, and may contribute to the high MDR-TB rates in Moldova. OBJECTIVE: To assess risk factors and timing of default from treatment for non-MDR-TB from 2007 to 2010. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of routine surveillance data on all non-MDR-TB patients reported. RESULTS: A total of 14.7% of non-MDR-TB patients defaulted from treatment during the study period. Independent risk factors for default included sociodemographic factors, such as homelessness, living alone, less formal education and spending substantial time outside Moldova in the year prior to diagnosis; and health-related factors such as human immunodeficiency virus co-infection, greater lung pathology and increasing TB drug resistance. Anti-tuberculosis treatment is usually initiated within an institutional setting in Moldova, and the default risk was highest in the month following the phase of hospitalized treatment (among civilians) and after leaving prison (among those diagnosed while incarcerated). CONCLUSIONS: Targeted interventions to increase treatment adherence for patients at highest risk of default, and improving the continuity of care for patients transitioning from institutional to community care may substantially reduce risk of default.

10.1007_s00284_012_0215_3	The Expression of ABC Efflux Pump, Rv1217c-Rv1218c, and Its Association with Multidrug Resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in China	Currently the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection is largely limited due to the prevalence of multidrug resistance strains. Over-expressing the efflux pumps such as the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter has been reported to significantly contribute to its resistance to several antibiotics. This study investigated the expression profile of one important ABC efflux pump, Rv1217c-Rv1218c, by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) in clinical isolates from China, which also revealed its association with the multidrug resistance of M. tuberculosis. Significantly increased expressions of Rv1217c and Rv1218c at transcriptional level have been observed in multidrug-resistant TB group (MDR-TB) compared to those of the drug-susceptible group (P < 0.05), when H37Rv strain was used as the control. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed that the over-expression of both Rv1217c and Rv1218c resulted in the higher minimum inhibition concentrations (MICs) of rifampicin (RIF) (OR = 1.01, P < 0.05 of Rv1217c; OR = 1.23, P < 0.05 of Rv1218c), while the over-expression of Rv1218c only led to the higher MICs of isoniazid (INH) (OR = 1.17, P < 0.05). Our findings contributed to the better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ABC efflux pumps, in particular Rv1217c-Rv1218c, in M. tuberculosis and will assist in developing new antibiotic treatments for multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis in the future.

A convenience sample of 309 drug-susceptible and 342 multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB isolates, collected July 2008-July 2009, were characterized by spoligotyping, DNA fingerprinting, insertion site mapping, and targeted DNA sequencing. Analysis of molecular-based data showed diverse genetic backgrounds among drug-sensitive and MDR TB sensu stricto isolates in contrast to restricted genetic backgrounds among pre-extensively drug-resistant (pre-XDR) TB and XDR TB isolates. Second-line drug resistance was significantly associated with the atypical Beijing genotype. DNA fingerprinting and sequencing demonstrated that the pre-XDR and XDR atypical Beijing isolates evolved from a common progenitor; 85% and 92%, respectively, were clustered, indicating transmission. Ninety-three percent of atypical XDR Beijing isolates had mutations that confer resistance to 10 anti-TB drugs, and some isolates also were resistant to para-aminosalicylic acid. These findings suggest the emergence of totally drug-resistant TB.		MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; BEIJING GENOTYPE; WESTERN-CAPE; STRAIN; CAPREOMYCIN; MUTATIONS; EPIDEMIC; AMIKACIN; ASSAY
10.3201_eid1903.121287	Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis, Somalia, 2010-2011	In a nationwide survey in 2011, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) was found in 5.2% and 40.8% of patients with new and previously treated TB, respectively. These levels of drug resistance are among the highest ever documented in Africa and the Middle East. This finding presents a serious challenge for TB control in Somalia.		
10.5588_ijtld.12.0100	Impact of the human immunodeficiency virus on early multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment outcomes in Botswana	SETTING: The impact of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa, where extensive rollout of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has occurred, remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To compare the time to initial culture conversion among patients with and those without HIV infection in a setting of individualized MDR-TB care in Botswana. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of MDR-TB patients receiving ambulatory, integrated TB-HIV care at two public clinics in Botswana. The time to culture conversion was compared by HIV status using Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: A total of 40 HIV-infected and 30 non-HIV-infected patients with MDR-TB and follow-up cultures were identified. The median time to initial culture conversion was 78 days (interquartile range [IQR] 42-186) for HIV-infected and 95 days (IQR 70-133) for non-HIV-infected individuals (log rank P > 0.5; unadjusted HR 0.9, 95%CI 0.5-1.5). Adjusting for age, sex, treatment history and number of active anti-tuberculosis drugs did not change this result (adjusted HR 0.8, 95%CI 0.4-1.4). CONCLUSION: We found no difference in the proportion of or time to initial sputum culture conversion between an HIV-infected and a non-infected cohort of MDR-TB patients in Botswana, suggesting that outcomes may be comparable in similar settings with access to individualized anti-tuberculosis treatment and HAART.

10.1371_journal.pone.0057719	Effectiveness of a Government-Organized and Hospital-Initiated Treatment for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients-A Retrospective Cohort Study	Background: In contrast to the conventional model of hospital-treated and government directly observed treatment (DOT) for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patient care, the Taiwan MDR-TB Consortium (TMTC) was launched in May 2007 with the collaboration of five medical care groups that have provided both care and DOT. This study aimed to determine whether the TMTC provided a better care model for MDR-TB patients than the conventional model. Methods and Findings: A total of 651 pulmonary MDR-TB patients that were diagnosed nation-wide from January 2000-August 2008 were enrolled. Of those, 290 (45%) MDR-TB patients whose initial sputum sample was taken in January 2007 or later were classified as patients in the TMTC era. All others were classified as patients in the pre-TMTC era. The treatment success rate at 36 months was better in the TMTC era group (82%) than in the pre-TMTC era group (61%) (p<0.001). With multiple logistic regressions, diagnosis in the TMTC era (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-4.2) was an independent predictor of a higher treatment success rate at 36 months. With the time-dependent proportional hazards method, a higher treatment success rate was still observed in the TMTC era group compared to the pre-TMTC era group (adjusted hazard ratio 6.3, 95% CI 4.2-9.5). Conclusion: The improved treatment success observed in the TMTC era compared to the pre-TMTC era is encouraging. The detailed TMTC components that contribute the most to the improved outcome will need confirmation in follow-up studies with large numbers of MDR-TB patients.

10.1371_journal.pone.0056074	A Systematic Review of Reported Cost for Smear and Culture Tests during Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment	Background: In 2011, World Health Organization revised its recommendation for microbiological monitoring during treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) by increasing the frequency of culture examination from quarterly to monthly after culture conversion. Implementing the recommendation requires substantial additional investment in laboratory infrastructure. The objective of this review is to provide cost evidence that is needed for national TB programs to budget for optimal monitoring strategies. Methods and Findings: We conducted the first systematic literature review on unit cost estimates of three monitoring strategies: 1) smear only; 2) culture only; 3) combined smear and culture. 26 peer-reviewed studies were selected by searching 10 databases in English and Chinese for literature published between 1995 and 2012. Cost estimates were converted into 2010 constant USD and international dollars. We assessed the quality of the estimates using a matrix with five essential elements and provided a cost projection for the combined smear and culture tests where the data were available. The 26 studies reported the cost estimates in 16 predominantly high- or middle-income countries from 1993 to 2009. The estimated unit cost for smear, culture, and combined tests ranges from $0.26 to $10.50, $1.63 to $62.01, and $26.73 to $39.57, respectively. The ratio of culture to smear costs varies from 1.35 to 11.98. The wide range of estimates is likely attributable to using different laboratory methods in different regions and years and differing practices in collecting and reporting cost data. Most studies did not report information critical for generalizing their conclusions. Conclusion: The paucity and low quality of unit cost estimates for TB monitoring in resource-poor settings impose technical challenges in predicting the resources needed for strengthening microbiological monitoring. To improve the validity and comparability of the cost data, we strongly advocate the data collection, estimation, and reporting follow protocols proposed by WHO.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed available clinical and drug susceptibility data for drug-resistant TB suspects referred for culture and drug-susceptibility testing between April 1, 2011 and March 1, 2012. The diagnostic accuracy of MODS was estimated against a reference standard including Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) media and manual liquid (BACTEC MGIT) culture. The accuracy of MODS drug-susceptibility testing (DST) was assessed against a reference standard absolute concentration method. Results: One hundred thirty-eight sputum samples were collected from 99 drug-resistant TB suspects; in addition, six previously cultured MDR isolates were included for assessment of DST accuracy. Among persons with known HIV infection status, 39/59 (66%) were HIV-infected. Eighty-six percent of patients had a history of prior TB treatment, and 80% of individuals were on antituberculous treatment at the time of sample collection. M. tuberculosis was identified by reference standard culture among 34/98 (35%) MDR-TB suspects. Overall MODS sensitivity for M. tuberculosis detection was 85% (95% CI, 69-95%) and specificity was 93% (95% CI, 84-98%); diagnostic accuracy did not significantly differ by HIV infection status. Median time to positivity was significantly shorter for MODS (7 days; IQR 7-15 days) than MGIT (12 days; IQR 6-16 days) or LJ (28 days; IQR 21-35 days; p < 0.001). Of 33 specimens with concurrent DST results, sensitivity of the MODS assay for detection of resistance to isoniazid, rifampin, and MDR-TB was 88% (95% CI, 68-97%), 96% (95% CI, 79-100%), and 91% (95% CI, 72-99%), respectively; specificity was 89% (95% CI, 52-100%), 89% (95% CI, 52-100%), and 90% (95% CI, 56-100%), respectively. Conclusion: In a high HIV-prevalence setting, MODS diagnosed TB and drug-resistant TB with high sensitivity and shorter turnaround time compared with standard culture and DST methods.

10.3760_cma.j.issn.0366_6999.20121366	Transmission of extensively drug-resistant and multidrug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in families identified by genotyping	Background Diagnosis and appropriate treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) remain major challenges. We sought to elucidate that persons who share a household with drug resistance tuberculosis patients are at high risk for primary drug resistance tuberculosis and how to prevent these outbreaks. Methods We used 12-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit and 7-locus variable-number tandem repeat to identify household transmission of extensively drug resistant and multiple drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in three families admitted in Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital affiliated with Tongji University. Drug susceptibility tests were done by the modified proportion method in the MGIT 960 system in the same time. Clinical data were also obtained from the subjects' medical records. Results All of the six strains were defined as Beijing genotype by the deletion-targeted multiplex PCR (DTM-PCR) identification on the genomic deletion RD105. Strains from family-1 had the same minisatellite interspersed repetitive unit (MIRU) pattern (232225172531) and the same MIRU pattern (3677235). Strains from family-2 had the same MIRU pattern (2212261553323) and the same MIRU pattern (3685134). Strains from family-3 did not have the same MIRU pattern and they differed at only one locus (223326173533, 223325173533), and did not have the same VNTR pattern with two locus differed (3667233, 3677234). Conclusions Household transmission exists in the three families. A clear chain of tuberculosis transmission within family exists. Tuberculosis susceptibility should be considered when there is more than one tuberculosis patients in a family. Household tuberculosis transmission could be prevented with adequate treatment of source patients.

10.1371_journal.pone.0055299	Incidence and Risk Factors for Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Delhi Region	Background: India with a major burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) does not have national level data on this hazardous disease. Since 2006, emergence of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is considered a serious threat to global TB control. This study highlights the demographic and clinical risk factors associated with XDR-TB in Delhi. Methods: The study was conducted during April 2007 to May 2010. Six hundred eleven MDR-TB suspects were enrolled from four tertiary care hospitals, treating TB patients in Delhi and the demographic details recorded. Sputum samples were cultured using rapid, automated liquid culture system (MGIT 960). Drug susceptibility testing (DST) for Rifampicin (RIF) and Isoniazid (INH) was performed for all positive M. tuberculosis (M.tb) cultures. All MDR-TB isolates were tested for sensitivity to second-line drugs [Amikacin (AMK), Capreomycin (CAP), Ofloxacin (OFX), Ethionamide (ETA)]. Results/Findings: Of 611, 483 patients were infected with MDR M. tuberculosis (M. tb) strains. Eighteen MDR-TB isolates (3.7%) were XDR M.tb strains. Family history of TB (p 0.045), socioeconomic status (p 0.013), concomitant illness (p 0.001) and previous intake of 2nd line injectable drugs (p 0.001) were significantly associated with occurrence of XDR-TB. Only two of the patients enrolled were HIV seropositive, but had a negative culture for M. tuberculosis. 56/483 isolates were pre-XDR M. tuberculosis, though the occurrence of pre-XDR-TB did not show any significant demographical associations. Conclusions: The actual incidence and prevalence rate of XDR-TB in India is not available, although some scattered data is available. This study raises a concern about existence of XDR-TB in India, though small, signaling a need to strengthen the TB control program for early diagnosis of both tuberculosis and drug resistance in order to break the chains of transmission.

10.1016_j.rmed.2012.10.021	The efficacy of rifabutin for rifabutin-susceptible, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Objective: We investigated the efficacy of rifabutin (RFB)-containing regimens for the treatment of RFB-susceptible, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Methods: From 146 patients diagnosed with MDR-TB between January 2006 and December 2009 at Asan Medical Center in South Korea, 31 patients (21.2%) were found to have RFB-susceptible MDR-TB. Of these 31 patients, 14 patients who had been treated with RFB for more than one month were included. Forty-two patients with RFB-resistant MDR-TB were selected as a control group, and the outcomes of both groups were retrospectively compared. Results: Of 14 patients with RFB-susceptible MDR-TB, the mean age was 44.4 years and the proportion of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) was 35.7% (5/14). Baseline characteristics and the drug resistance pattern (except RFB) did not differ between the two groups. Treatment success was achieved in 12 (85.7%) patients in the RFB group: cure in 10 (71.4%) and treatment completion in two (14.3%). The treatment success rate was 52.4% (22/42) in the control group (p = 0.032). Treatment failure was more common in patients of the control group (40.5% vs. 14.3%; p = 0.106). Conclusions: RFB is useful as an additional drug in the treatment of MDR-TB in patients with RFB-susceptible MDR-TB. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.5588_ijtld.12.0195	Spoligotyping of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in Ethiopia	SETTING: St Peter Tuberculosis (TB) Specialized Hospital and the Aklilu Lemma Institute of Pathobiology, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. OBJECTIVE: To genotype multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates and assess the magnitude of their clustering. DESIGN: A total of 183 consecutive MDR-TB isolates collected between September 2009 and February 2012 were characterised using molecular typing. Prior to the study, the isolates were confirmed as MDR-TB using GenoType (R) MTBDRplus. Recent transmission index was used to analyse the clusters. RESULTS: Spoligotyping identified 43 different patterns, of which 17 consisted of at least two isolates forming clusters, while 26 had only a single isolate. The most frequent patterns were spoligo international typing (SIT) number 21 and 149. Twenty-four patterns did not match existing patterns in the SpolDB4 database. The strains belonged to three lineages, the predominant lineages being Euro-American and Indo-Oceanic, each consisting of 65 isolates. High proportions (86%) of patients were infected with clustered strains, suggesting probable recent transmission of MDR-TB in the study area. CONCLUSION: The observation of cluster formation of the spoligotype patterns of MDR-TB isolates could suggest transmission of MDR-TB strains among the population, thus warranting further attention.	drug resistance; recent transmission; clustering; lineage; tuberculosis	FRAGMENT-LENGTH-POLYMORPHISM; MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; DIFFERENTIATION; IS6110; TRANSMISSION; UTILITY; HEALTH
10.5588_ijtld.12.0533	A pilot external quality assurance programme for line-probe assay detection of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance	BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB; resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin) is difficult to detect and control. Line-probe assays (LiPA) are widely used for the rapid detection of MDR-TB. OBJECTIVE: To ensure the quality of the test, a pilot external quality assurance (EQA) programme was initiated to assess the feasibility of running such a programme and the possibility of improving the proficiency of TB laboratories in performing the test. DESIGN: Prepared filter-paper-based Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA samples were shipped to participant laboratories for LiPA EQA. The tests were performed blind, and the results were returned to the organising laboratory for comparison and analysis. RESULTS: A total of four rounds of EQA samples were dispatched to five laboratories in four countries. Overall inter- and intra-laboratory reproducibility was respectively 97% and 96%. The strengths and weaknesses of the participant laboratories in performing the test were discussed. CONCLUSION: A LiPA EQA programme can ensure quality and improve the performance of TB laboratories. This is a critical step during the initial stages at the time of setting up this method of testing.	rapid tests; MDR-TB; molecular; laboratory	EXPERIENCE; DNA; PCR
10.1128_JCM.02837_12	How Many Sputum Culture Results Do We Need To Monitor Multidrug-Resistant-Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Patients during Treatment?	Discharge of a hospital patient after a single negative sputum culture may save money when treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. However, after initial sputum conversion in 336 South Africans, 11.6% and 5.4% reconverted after 1 and 2 months, respectively. These findings endorse the WHO definitions of 2 negative cultures taken >= 30 days apart after sputum culture conversion.		CONVERSION
10.1097_INF.0b013e31826f6063	Tuberculosis in Children Exposed at Home to Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis	Background: The tuberculosis burden in children exposed at home to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is unquantified. With limited access to MDR-TB treatment, likely millions of children share the experience of chronic exposure to an infectious patient. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of child and adult household contacts of patients treated for MDR-TB in Lima, Peru, in 1996 to 2003. The primary outcome was TB disease. We estimated prevalence of TB disease when the index case began MDR-TB treatment and incidence of TB disease over the subsequent 4 years. Results: Among 1299 child contacts, 67 were treated for TB. TB prevalence was 1771 (confidence interval [CI]: 1052-2489) per 100,000 children. In 4362 child-years of follow-up, TB incidence rates per 100,000 child-years were: 2079 (CI: 1302-2855) in year 1; 315 (CI: 6-624) in year 2; 634 (CI: 195-1072) in year 3; and 530 (CI: 66-994) in year 4. TB disease rates in children aged > 1 year were not significantly different from those observed in adults. Children accounted for 20% of TB cases. Seven (87.5%) of 8 children tested had MDR-TB. Child contacts had TB disease rates approximately 30 times higher than children in the general population. Conclusions: Children were at high risk for TB disease when the index case started MDR-TB treatment and during the following year. These results highlight the need for implementing contact investigations and establishing systems for prompt referral and treatment of pediatric household contacts of MDR-TB patients, regardless of the age of the child.	pediatric; household; contact investigation; disease burden; prevalence; incidence; follow-up; person-years; evaluation; drug resistance; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	COMMUNITY-BASED THERAPY; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; CHILDHOOD TUBERCULOSIS; PEDIATRIC TUBERCULOSIS; YOUNG-CHILDREN; LIMA; PERU; HOUSEHOLDS; PROGRAMS; CONTACTS
10.1111_cei.12007	Different immunosuppressive mechanisms in multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria patients	Previous studies have demonstrated that cells from both multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) patients respond poorly to mycobacterial antigens in vitro. In the prepercentage of CD4+CD25+- forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3)+ and CD4+CD25+CD127- regulatory T (Treg) cells when compared to NR-TB. Increased numbers of Treg cells and interleukin (IL)-10 serum levels were detected in MDR-TB, whereas elevated serum transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta was found in the NTM group. Cells of MDR-TB patients stimulated with early secretory antigenic target (ESAT)-6, but not purified protein derivative (PPD), showed a lower frequency of CD4+/interferon (IFN)-?+ T cells and enhanced CD4+CD25+FoxP3+, CD4+CD25+CD127- and CD4+CD25+IL-10+ T cell population. In addition, increased IL-10 secretion was observed in cultured MDR-TB cells following ESAT-6 stimulation, but not in NR-TB or NTM patients. In vitro blockade of IL-10 or IL-10Ra decreased the CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ frequencies induced by ESAT-6 in MDR-TB, suggesting a role of IL-10 on impaired IFN-? responses seen in MDR-TB. Depletion of CD4+CD25+ T lymphocytes restored the capacity of MDR-TB T cells to respond to ESAT-6 in vitro, which suggests a potential role for Treg/T regulatory 1 cells in the pathogenesis of MDR-TB. Together, our results indicate that although the similarities in chronicity, NTM- and MDR-TB-impaired antigenic responses involve different mechanisms.

pub-1062	Contribution of medical colleges to tuberculosis control in India under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP): Lessons learnt & challenges ahead	Medical college faculty, who are academicians are seldom directly involved in the implementation of national public health programmes. More than a decade ago for the first time in the global history of tuberculosis (TB) control, medical colleges of India were involved in the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) of Government of India (GOI). This report documents the unique and extraordinary course of events that led to the involvement of medical colleges in the RNTCP of GOI. It also reports the contributions made by the medical colleges to TB control in India. For more than a decade, medical colleges have been providing diagnostic services (Designated Microscopy Centres), treatment [Directly Observed Treatment (DOT) Centres] referral for treatment, recording and reporting data, carrying out advocacy for RNTCP and conducting operational research relevant to RNTCP. Medical colleges are contributing to diagnosis and treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-TB co-infection and development of laboratory infrastructure for early diagnosis of multidrug-resistant and/or extensively drug-resistant TB (M/XDR-TB) and DOTS-Plus sites for treatment of MDR-TB cases. Overall, at a national level, medical colleges have contributed to 25 per cent of TB suspects referred for diagnosis; 23 per cent of 'new smear-positives' diagnosed; 7 per cent of DOT provision within medical college; and 86 per cent treatment success rate among new smear-positive patients. As the Programme widens its scope, future challenges include sustenance of this contribution and facilitating universal access to quality TB care; greater involvement in operational research relevant to the Programme needs; and better co-ordination mechanisms between district, state, zonal and national level to encourage their involvement.

10.1371_journal.pone.0054587	What is the Cost of Diagnosis and Management of Drug Resistant Tuberculosis in South Africa?	Background: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is undermining TB control in South Africa. However, there are hardly any data about the cost of treating DR-TB in high burden settings despite such information being quintessential for the rational planning and allocation of resources by policy-makers, and to inform future cost-effectiveness analyses. Methodology: We analysed the comparative 2011 United States dollar ($) cost of diagnosis and treatment of drug sensitive TB (DS-TB), MDR-TB and XDR-TB, based on National South African TB guidelines, from the perspective of the National TB Program using published clinical outcome data. Principal Findings: Assuming adherence to national DR-TB management guidelines, the per patient cost of XDR-TB was $ 26,392, four times greater than MDR-TB ($ 6772), and 103 times greater than drug-sensitive TB ($ 257). Despite DR-TB comprising only 2.2% of the case burden, it consumed,similar to 32% of the total estimated 2011 national TB budget of US $ 218 million. 45% and 25% of the DR-TB costs were attributed to anti-TB drugs and hospitalization, respectively. XDR-TB consumed 28% of the total DR-TB diagnosis and treatment costs. Laboratory testing and anti-TB drugs comprised the majority (71%) of MDR-TB costs while hospitalization and anti-TB drug costs comprised the majority (92%) of XDR-TB costs. A decentralized XDR-TB treatment programme could potentially reduce costs by $ 6930 (26%) per case and reduce the total amount spent on DR-TB by,similar to 7%. Conclusion/Significance: Although DR-TB forms a very small proportion of the total case burden it consumes a disproportionate and substantial amount of South Africa's total annual TB budget. These data inform rational resource allocation and selection of management strategies for DR-TB in high burden settings.

10.1371_journal.pone.0053466	Multidrug and Extensively Drug-resistant Tuberculosis in Canada 1997-2008: Demographic and Disease Characteristics	Setting: Nationwide Canadian public health surveillance. Objective: Description of demographic features and disease characteristics of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in Canada over a 12 year period. Design: Continuous surveillance of all cases of culture-confirmed TB in Canada. Demographic and microbiologic features were analyzed and comparisons between drug-susceptible, multidrug-resistant (MDR), and drug-resistant not-MDR were made. Cases of extensively drug resistant TB are described. Results: 15,993 cases of culture-confirmed TB were reported during the study period. There were 5 cases of XDR-TB, 177 cases of MDR-TB, and 1,234 cases of first-line drug resistance not-MDR. The majority of drug-resistant cases were reported in foreign-born individuals, with drug-resistant cases diagnosed earlier post-arrival in Canada compared to drug-susceptible cases. In MDR-TB isolates, there was a high rate of drug-resistance to other first- and second-line drugs, making reliable empiric therapeutic recommendations for MDR-TB difficult. There was a statistically significant association between both MDR and drug-resistance not-MDR, and the risk of a negative treatment outcome (defined as treatment failure, absconded, or treatment ongoing >3 yrs). Conclusion: Drug-resistance complicates TB management even in developed nations with well-established TB control programs. The predominantly international origin of drug-resistant cases highlights the need for global strategies to combat TB.		MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS
pub-1065	Investigation of Extensive Drug Resistance in Multidrug Resistance Tuberculosis Isolates	Increasing number of drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) cases, observed in recent years, is an important public health problem. Extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) is the development of resistance against any fluoroquinolones and at least one of the injectable second line anti-TB drugs in addition to resistance against isoniazide and rifampicin which are the first line anti-TB drugs [definition of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB)]. Anti-TB therapy failed with first-line anti-TB drugs due to MDR-TB cases is being planned according to second-line anti-TB drug susceptibility test results if available and if not, standart treatment protocols are used. Although it is recommended that individual anti-TB therapy should be designed according to the isolate's susceptibility test results, standart therapeutic protocols are always needed since second-line anti-TB drug susceptibility testing generally could not be performed in developing countries like Turkey. For this reason, nationwide and regional surveillance studies to determine the resistance patterns are always needed to make decisions about the standard therapy algorithms. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the presence of extensive drug resistance among 81 MDR-TB isolates obtained from various health care facilities from Istanbul, Izmir and Manisa and to determine the XDR-TB incidence in Marmara and Aegean regions. Furthermore, we aimed to provide epidemiological data to clinicians to support their choice of second-line anti-TB drugs for MDR-TB infections. Susceptibility testing of isolates for the first and the second-line anti-TB drugs were performed by using modified Middlebrook 7H9 broth in fluorometric BACTEC MGIT 960 system (Becton Dickinson, USA). Eighty-one MDR-TB isolates included in this study were isolated from 43 (53.1%) patients residing in Istanbul, 26 (32.1%) in Izmir and 12 (14.8%) in Manisa provinces. We could not find any isolate consistent with XDR-TB definition in this study. Second-line drug resistance rates of MDR-TB isolates to amikacin and kanamycin were 1.2%, ofloxacin and levofloxacin were 2.5%, capreomycin was 14.8%, ethionamide was 37% whereas linezolid resistance was not detected. Statistically significant correlation was detected between resistance rates of these antibiotic pairs; levofloxacin-ofloxacin (p< 0.01), amikacin-kanamycin (p= 0.01) and streptomycin-ethionamide (p= 0.04). In our study, extensive drug resistance was not encountered in any MDR-TB isolates while high resistance rates was observed against ethionamide and capreomycin. It can be concluded that parenteral aminoglycosides amikasin and kanamycin, fluoroquinolones and linezolid seemed to be reliable anti-TB agents in MDR-TB treatment, however, further larger scale studies are needed.

10.1002_jcla.21558	Rapid Genotypic Detection of rpoB and katG Gene Mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Clinical Isolates from Northern India as Determined by MAS-PCR	BackgroundThere is a growing need to develop rapid laboratory research methods to counter the menace of drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases worldwide especially in developing countries. The present study was undertaken to investigate the type and frequency of rpoB and katG mutations in rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) resistant strains respectively of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) circulating in Northern India and to explore the utility of multiplex-allele-specific (MAS)-PCR assay for detection of drug-resistant MTB isolates in low resource set up. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 27:31-37, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. MethodsPhenotypic and genotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed on 354 MTB isolates. ResultsMutation in rpoB gene was found most frequently at codons 531, 526 and 516 (59.83%, 45.29% and 22.22%, respectively). Further, combinations of 2-3 point mutations were also observed in 19.66% of RIF-resistant MTB strains. The frequency of mutations in katG gene was found at codon 315 among 82.95% of the INH-resistant MTB isolates. MAS-PCR detected rpoB and katG mutations in phenotypically resistant isolates with sensitivities of 93% and 83% respectively. ConclusionMAS-PCR assays can be used for rapid detection of drug-resistant TB strains in routine diagnostic practice, enabling early administration of appropriate treatment regimens to the affected patients.

10.1159_000348374	Impact of Diabetes on Treatment Outcomes and Long-Term Survival in Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Background: Few studies have investigated the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM), a globally increasing metabolic disease, on treatment outcomes and long-term survival in patients with multidrug-resistant forms of tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Objectives: We analyzed outcomes in a large cohort to assess the impact of DM on treatment outcomes of patients with MDR-TB. Methods: MDR-TB patients newly diagnosed or retreated between 2000 and 2002 and followed for 8-11 years were retrospectively analyzed with respect to the effect of DM as a comorbidity on their treatment outcome and long-term survival. Results: Of 1,407 patients with MDR-TB, 239 (17.0%) had coexisting DM. The mean age and body mass index were higher in MDR-TB patients with DM [MDRTBDM(+)] than in those without DM [MDR-TBDM(-)]. Patients with MDR-TB and a comorbidity of DM had a significantly lower treatment success rate than those without a history of DM (36.0 vs. 47.2%, p = 0.002). In addition, DM was the negative predictor for MDR-TB treatment success in multivariate analyses [odds ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26-0.99]. Mean survival times were also lower in MDR-TBDM(+) than in MDR-TBDM(-) patients (102 vs. 114 months, p = 0.001), with DM as a significant predictor of poor long-term survival in multivariate analyses (hazard ratio 1.59, 95% CI 1.01-2.50). Conclusions: Among MDR-TB patients, DM was a relatively common comorbidity. In patients undergoing treatment for MDR-TB and followed for 8-11 years, it was found to be independently associated with an increased risk of both treatment failure and death. Copyright (C) 2013 S.

10.7754_Clin.Lab.2012.120618	Evaluation of Rezasurin Microtiter Assay and High Resolution Melting Curve Analysis for Detection of Rifampicin and Isoniazid Resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Clinical Isolates	Background: Several methods have been proposed for rapid detection of drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). High resolution melting (HRM) curve analysis has been developed for accurate and simultaneous detection of resistance of M. tuberculosis isolates to rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH). Other techniques include the resazurin microtiter assay (REMA) which is one of the new colorimetric phenotypic methods. The present study evaluated the HRM curve analysis and REMA assay in comparison to the proportional method (PM) for rapid identification of multidrug resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis isolates. Methods: Thirty M. tuberculosis clinical isolates of known resistance phenotypes were used. An HRM curve was generated for each isolate to scan for mutations in the rpoB and katG genes to detect REF and INH resistance, respectively. The REMA colorimetric assay was also evaluated using the same isolates. The results of both techniques were compared to the gold standard proportional method. Results: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of the REMA assay for RIF and INH susceptibility testing were 100%. The HRM curve assay results for RIF susceptibility testing were 92.3%, 100%, 100%, 94.4%, and 96.7%, respectively, and for INH they were 85%, 100%, 100%, 76.9%, and 90%, respectively. Conclusions: REMA is a rapid non-conventional and inexpensive method and may serve as a replacement for the proportion method in resource limited settings, while the PPV and NPV of the HRM curve make this assay an ideal screening method for the TB laboratory.

10.1155_2013_167954	Mutations in the embB Gene and Their Association with Ethambutol Resistance in Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Clinical Isolates from Poland	"Ethambutol (EMB) continues to be used as part of a standard drug regimen for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). Mutations in the embB gene and those within its conserved EMB resistance determining region (ERDR) in particular have repeatedly been associated with resistance to EMB in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The aim of this study was to examine the mutational ""hot spots"" in the embB gene, including the ERDR, among multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis clinical isolates and to find a possible association between embB mutations and resistance to EMB. An 863-bp fragment of the embB gene was sequenced in 17 EMB-resistant and 33 EMB-susceptible MDR-TB isolates. In total, eight embB mutation types were detected in 6 distinct codons of 27 (54%) M. tuberculosis isolates. Mutations in codon 306 were most common, found in both EMB-resistant (9) and EMB-susceptible (11) isolates. Only mutations in codons 406 and 507 were found exclusively in four and one EMB-resistant isolates, respectively. Sequence analysis of the ERDR in the embB gene is not sufficient for rapid detection of EMB resistance, and the codon 306 mutations are not good predictive markers of resistance to EMB."

10.7150_ijms.6806	Magnitude of Gene Mutations Conferring Drug Resistance in Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Isolates from Lymph Node Aspirates in Ethiopia	Objective: Resistance to drugs is due to particular genomic mutations in the specific genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Timely genetic characterization will allow identification of resistance mutations that will optimize an effective antibiotic treatment regimen. We determine the magnitude of gene mutations conferring resistance to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP) and ethambutol (EMB) among tuberculosis (TB) lymphadenitis patients. Methods: A cross sectional prospective study was conducted among 226 M. tuberculosis isolates from culture positive lymph node aspirates collected from TB lymphadenitis patients between April 2012 and May 2012. Detection of mutations conferring resistance to drugs was carried out using GenoType (R) MTBDRplus and GenoType (R) MTBDRsl assay. Results: Out of the 226 strains, mutations conferring resistance to INH, RMP, multidrug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and EMB were 8, 3, 2 and 2 isolates, respectively. There was no isolated strain that showed mutation in the inhA promoter region gene. All INH resistant strains had mutations in the katG gene at codon 315 with amino acid change of S315T1. Among rifampicin resistant strains, two isolates displayed mutations at codon 531 in the rpoB gene with amino acid change of S531L and one isolate was by omission of wild type probes at Q513L. According to mutations associated with ethambutol resistance, all of the isolates had mutations in the embB gene with aminoacid change of M306I. All isolates resistant to INH, RMP and MDR using BacT/AlerT 3D system were correctly identified by GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay. Conclusion: We observed mutations conferring resistance to INH at S315T1 of the katG gene, RMP at S531L and Q513L in the rpoB genes and EMB at M306I of the embB gene. In the absence of conventional drug susceptibility testing, the effort to develop easy, rapid and cost effective molecular assays for drug resistance TB monitoring is definitely desirable and the GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay was found to be a useful method for diagnosis of resistance to INH, RMP and MDR from lymph node aspirates. Further molecular cluster analysis to determine transmission dynamics of mutated strain is required.

10.4103_0255_0857.108720	Changing patterns and trends of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis at referral centre in Northern India: A 4-year experience	Purpose: India has a high burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), although there is little data on multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Although MDR-TB has existed for long time in India, very few diagnostic laboratories are well-equipped to test drug sensitivity. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of MDR-TB, first-line drug resistance patterns and its changing trends in northern India in the 4 years. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective study from July 2007 to December 2010. Microscopy, culture by Bactec460 and p-nitro-alpha-acety lamino-beta-hydroxypropiophenone (NAP) test was performed to isolate and identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) complex (MTBC). Drug sensitivity testing (DST) was performed by 1% proportional method (Bactec460) for four drugs: Rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and streptomycin. Various clinical and demographical profiles were evaluated to analyse risk factors for development of drug resistance. Results: We found the overall prevalence rate of MDR-TB to be 38.8%, increasing from 36.4% in 2007 to 40.8% in 2010. we found that the prevalence of MDR-TB in new and previously treated cases was 29.1% and 43.3% (P < 0.05; CI 95%). The increasing trend of MDR-TB was more likely in pulmonary TB when compared with extra-pulmonary TB (P < 0.05; CI 95%). Conclusions: we found a high prevalence (38.8%) of MDR-TB both in new cases (29.1%) and previously treated cases (43.3%). This study strongly highlights the need to make strategies for testing, surveillance, monitoring and management of such drug-resistant cases.

pub-1072	Association between embB mutations and ethambutol resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Cuba and the Dominican Republic: reproducible patterns and problems	The relation of ethambutol resistance to embB mutations remains unclear, and there are no reports on ethambutol resistance from the Caribbean. We examined the sequence of embB in 57 distinct Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) and non-MDR strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, mostly from Cuba and the Dominican Republic. embB306 codon mutations Were found exclusively in MDR-TB, but in both ethambutol sensitive and resistant strains. Valine substitutions predominated in ethambutol resistant strains, while isoleucine replacements were more common in sensitive strains. Three ethambutol resistant MDR strains without embB306 substitutions had replacements in embB406 or embB497, but these were also found in ethambutol sensitive MDR strains. The results confirm previous findings that amino acid substitutions in EmbB306, EmbB406 and EmbB497 are found only in MDR-TB strains but in both phenotypically resistant and sensitive strains. One ethambutol resistant non-MDR strain did not have any embB mutation suggesting that other undefined mutations can also confer ethambutol resistance.

10.1016_j.tube.2012.10.013	Rifampicin-induced transcriptome response in rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Tuberculosis (TB) is still a major life-threatening infectious disease, within which especially the rise of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) is currently worrying. This study focuses on mechanisms of development of rifampicin resistance, since rifampicin seems to play an important role in the development of MDR-TB. To provide further insight in rifampicin resistance, we performed a genome-wide transcriptional profile analysis for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) using microarray technology and qRT-PCR analysis. We exposed a rifampicin-susceptible H37Rv wild type (H37Rv-WT) and a rifampicin-resistant progeny H37Rv strain with a H526Y mutation in the rpoB gene (H37Rv-H526Y) to several concentrations of rifampicin, to define the effect of rifampicin on the transcription profile. Our study showed that there are resistance-dependant differences in response between both M. tuberculosis strains. Gene clusters associated with efflux, transport and virulence were altered in the rifampicin-resistant H37Rv mutant compared to the rifampicin-susceptible H37Rv-WT strain after exposure to rifampicin. We conclude that the small gene cluster Rv0559c-Rv0560c in the H37Rv-H526Y strain was remarkably up-regulated in the microarray analysis and qRT-PCR results and appeared to be dependent on rifampicin concentration and time of exposure. Therefore this study suggests that Rv0559c and Rv0560c play a pivotal role in rifampicin resistance of M. tuberculosis. Further investigation of Rv0559c and Rv0560c is needed to reveal function and mechanism of both genes that were triggered upon rifampicin exposure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.1111_1348_0421.12000	Drug resistance and IS6110-RFLP patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in patients with recurrent tuberculosis in northern Thailand	The emergence of drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis has become a global threat to tuberculosis (TB) prevention and control efforts. This study aimed to determine the drug resistance profiles and DNA fingerprints of M. tuberculosis strains isolated from patients with relapsed or retreatment pulmonary TB in Chiang Rai province in northern Thailand. Significant differences in multidrug resistance (MDR) (P = 0.025) and resistance to isoniazid (P = 0.025) and rifampin (P = 0.046) between first and second registrations of patients with retreatment TB were found. However, there were no significant differences in resistance to any drugs in patients with relapsed TB. The rate of MDR-TB strains was 12.2% among new patients at first registration, 22.5% among patients with recurrence who had previously undergone treatment at second registration and 12.5% at third registration. Two retreatment patients whose initial treatment had failed had developed MDR-TB with resistance to all TB drugs tested, including rifampin, isoniazid, streptomycin and ethambutol. IS6110-RFLP analysis revealed that 66.7% (10/15 isolates) of MDR-TB belonged to the Beijing family. In most cases, IS6110-RFLP patterns of isolates from the same patients were identical in relapse and retreatment groups. However, some pairs of isolates from retreatment patients after treatment failure had non-identical IS6110-RFLP patterns. These results suggest that, after failure and default treatment, patients with retreatment tuberculosis have a significantly greater risk of MDR-TB, isoniazid and rifampin resistance than do other patients.	drug resistance; IS6110-restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns; recurrent tuberculosis	FRAGMENT-LENGTH-POLYMORPHISM; EXOGENOUS REINFECTION; MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; RESTRICTION; INFECTION; EVOLUTION; OUTCOMES; RELAPSE; STRAIN
10.2471_BLT.12.104588	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Belarus: the size of the problem and associated risk factors	Objective To assess the problem of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) throughout Belarus and investigate the associated risk factors. Methods In a nationwide survey in 2010-2011,1420 tuberculosis (TB) patients were screened and 934 new and 410 previously treated cases of TB were found to meet the inclusion criteria. Isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from each eligible patient were tested for susceptibility to anti-TB drugs. Sociobehavioural information was gathered in interviews based on a structured questionnaire. Findings MDR-TB was found in 32.3% and 75.6% of the new and previously treated patients, respectively, and, 11.9% of the 612 patients found to have MDR-TB had extensively drug-resistant-TB (XDR-TB). A history of previous treatment for TB was the strongest independent risk factor for MDR-TB (odds ratio, OR: 6.1;95% confidence interval, CI:4.8-7.7).The other independent risk factors were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.4-3.5), age <35 years (OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.0-1.8), history of imprisonment (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.0), disability sufficient to prevent work (OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.2-3.0), alcohol abuse (OR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.0-1.8) and smoking (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.0). Conclusion MDR-TB is very common among TB patients throughout Belarus. The numerous risk factors identified for MDR-TB and the convergence of the epidemics of MDR-TB and HIV infection call not only for stronger collaboration between TB and HIV control programmes, but also for the implementation of innovative measures to accelerate the detection of TB resistance and improve treatment adherence.

10.1128_JCM.02513_12	Diagnostic Accuracy of the GenoType MTBDRsl Assay for Rapid Diagnosis of Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in HIV-Coinfected Patients	The Russian Federation is a high-tuberculosis (TB)-burden country with high rates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis multidrug resistance (MDR) and extensive drug resistance (XDR), especially in HIV-coinfected patients. Rapid and reliable diagnosis for detection of resistance to second-line drugs is vital for adequate patient management. We evaluated the performance of the GenoType MTBDRsl (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) assay on smear-positive sputum specimens obtained from 90 HIV-infected MDR TB patients from Russia. Test interpretability was over 98%. Specificity was over 86% for all drugs, while sensitivity varied, being the highest (71.4%) for capreomycin and lowest (9.4%) for kanamycin, probably due to the presence of mutations in the eis gene. The sensitivity of detection of XDR TB was 13.6%, increasing to 42.9% if kanamycin (not commonly used in Western Europe) was excluded. The assay is a highly specific screening tool for XDR detection in direct specimens from HIV-coinfected TB patients but cannot be used to rule out XDR TB.		2ND-LINE ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; ETHAMBUTOL RESISTANCE; CLINICAL-SAMPLES; FEASIBILITY; PERFORMANCE; PREVALENCE; STRAINS; RUSSIA
10.5588_ijtld.12.0344	High risk of drug-resistant tuberculosis when first-line therapy fails in a high HIV prevalence setting	SETTING: Lesotho national multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) program. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) among patients registered for MDR-TB treatment after failure or suspected failure of the standard 6-month regimen for new TB patients (Category I). DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients registered for MDR-TB treatment following failure or suspected failure of Category I. RESULTS: A total of 76 patients were included in the analysis, including 51 Category I treatment failures and 25 suspected Category I treatment failures. The prevalence of resistance to any drug was 92% among the treatment failures and 72% among the suspected failures. The proportion of MDR-TB was respectively 78% and 28% among the treatment failures and suspected failures. Among the subgroup of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients, the proportion of MDR-TB was 84% among failures and 23% among suspected failures. CONCLUSION: DR-TB and MDR-TB were common among patients in whom Category I failed. Early initiation of empiric second-line anti-tuberculosis treatment while awaiting culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) results should be considered for HIV-negative and -positive patients who have failed first-line anti-tuberculosis treatment; patients suspected to be failing a first-line regimen should undergo DST at the end of the intensive phase.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; drug resistance; treatment failure; HIV/AIDS	STANDARD RETREATMENT REGIMEN; SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE; MDR-TB; CATEGORY; PROGRAMS; RELAPSE; AFRICA
10.5588_ijtld.12.0197	GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay detection of drug-resistant tuberculosis in routine practice in Korea	SETTING: Korea is an intermediate-burden country with high rates of tuberculosis (TB) drug resistance. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of the GenoType (R) MTBDRplus (MTBDR) assay in diagnosing drug-resistant TB in routine practice in Korea. DESIGN: The MTBDR assay was performed on 428 samples, and the results were retrospectively compared with the results of conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST). The interval between treatment and diagnosis of drug resistance was also compared. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of the MTBDR assay were respectively 96.6%, 98.9%, 93.4% and 99.5% for the detection of rifampicin (RMP) resistance; 93.8%, 98.3%, 92.7% and 98.6% for isoniazid (INH) resistance; and 91.1%, 99.2%, 99.4% and 98.7% for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). The median interval between the start of anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy and the reporting of results was 88.9 days for conventional DST and 19.8 days for MTBDR using clinical specimens. CONCLUSION: The specificity of the MTBDR assay in detecting MDR-TB was very high, although the sensitivity in detecting INH resistance and MDR-TB was not optimal (<95%). Although the turnaround time in detecting drug resistance was dramatically reduced with MTBDR compared to conventional DST, more effort is needed to shorten the turnaround time.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; sensitivity and specificity; line-probe assay	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; RIFAMPIN; SPECIMENS
10.1093_bioinformatics_bts641	MycPermCheck: the Mycobacterium tuberculosis permeability prediction tool for small molecules	Motivation: With >8 million new cases in 2010, particularly documented in developing countries, tuberculosis (TB) is still a highly present pandemic and often terminal. This is also due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains (MDR-TB and XDR-TB) of the primary causative TB agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Efforts to develop new effective drugs against MTB are restrained by the unique and largely impermeable composition of the mycobacterial cell wall. Results: Based on a database of antimycobacterial substances (CDD TB), 3815 compounds were classified as active and thus permeable. A data mining approach was conducted to gather the physico-chemical similarities of these substances and delimit them from a generic dataset of drug-like molecules. On the basis of the differences in these datasets, a regression model was generated and implemented into the online tool MycPermCheck to predict the permeability probability of small organic compounds. Discussion: Given the current lack of precise molecular criteria determining mycobacterial permeability, MycPermCheck represents an unprecedented prediction tool intended to support antimycobacterial drug discovery. It follows a novel knowledge-driven approach to estimate the permeability probability of small organic compounds. As such, MycPermCheck can be used intuitively as an additional selection criterion for potential new inhibitors against MTB. Based on the validation results, its performance is expected to be of high practical value for virtual screening purposes.

10.1111_tmi.12018	Costs of inpatient treatment for multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa	Background In South Africa, patients with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are hospitalised from MDR-TB treatment initiation until culture conversion. Although MDR-TB accounts for <3% of incident TB in South Africa, 55% of the public sector TB budget is spent on MDR-TB. To inform new strategies for MDR-TB management, we estimated the per-patient cost (USD 2011) of inpatient MDR-TB treatment. Methods All resources used by patients admitted to the MDR-TB hospital with confirmed MDR-TB from March 2009 to February 2010 were abstracted from patient records for up to 12 months after initial admission or until the earliest of final discharge, abscondment or death. Costs of hospital stay/day were estimated from hospital expenditure records and costs for drugs, laboratory tests, radiography and surgery from public sector sources. 133 patients met study inclusion criteria of whom 121 had complete cost records. Results By 12 months, 86% were discharged with culture conversion, 8% died in hospital, 2% were still admitted, and 3% had absconded. The mean hospital stay was 105 days. The mean total cost per patient was $17 164, of which 95% were hospitalisation costs (buildings, staff, etc.) and = 2% each for MDR-TB drugs ($380); TB laboratory tests, including drug susceptibility testing ($236); and other costs. Conclusions The inpatient cost per patient treated for MDR-TB is more than 40 times the cost of treating drug-susceptible TB in South Africa. There is potential for substantial cost savings from improved management of drug-susceptible TB and shifting to a model of decentralised, outpatient MDR-treatment.	multi-drug-resistant; tuberculosis; cost; South Africa; hospitalisation	
10.1093_jac_dks371	From multidrug-resistant to extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in Lisbon, Portugal: the stepwise mode of resistance acquisition	The development and transmission of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) constitutes a serious threat to the effective control of TB in several countries. Here, in an attempt to further elucidate the dynamics of the acquisition of resistance to second-line drugs and investigate an eventual role for eis promoter mutations in aminoglycoside resistance, we have studied a set of multidrug-resistant (MDR)/XDR-TB isolates circulating in Lisbon, Portugal. Forty-four MDR-TB or XDR-TB isolates were genotyped and screened for mutations in genes associated with second-line drug resistance, namely tlyA, gyrA, rrs and eis. The most prevalent mutations found in each gene were Ins755GT in tlyA, A1401G in rrs, G-10A in eis and S91P in gyrA. Additionally, two genetic clusters were found in this study: Lisboa3 and Q1. The characteristic mutational profile found among recent XDR-TB circulating in Lisbon was also found in MDR-TB strains isolated in the 1990s. Also investigated was the resistance level conferred by eis G-10A mutations, revealing that eis G-10A mutations may result in amikacin resistance undetectable by widely used phenotypic assays. The analysis of the distribution of the mutations found by genetic clustering showed that in the Q1 cluster, two mutations, gyrA D94A and rrs A1401G, were enough to ensure development of XDR-TB from an MDR strain. Moreover, in the Lisboa3 cluster it was possible to elaborate a model in which the development of low-level kanamycin resistance was at the origin of the emergence of XDR-TB strains that can be discriminated by tlyA mutations.

10.1186_1471_2334_12_385	Characteristics of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Namibia	Background: To describe the epidemiology and possible risk factors for the development of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Namibia. Methods: Using medical records and patient questionnaires, we conducted a case-control study among patients diagnosed with TB between January 2007 and March 2009. Cases were defined as patients with laboratory-confirmed MDR-TB; controls had laboratory-confirmed drug-susceptible TB or were being treated with WHO Category I or Category II treatment regimens. Results: We enrolled 117 MDR-TB cases and 251 TB controls, of which 100% and 2% were laboratory-confirmed, respectively. Among cases, 97% (113/117) had been treated for TB before the current episode compared with 46% (115/251) of controls (odds ratio [OR] 28.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 10.3-80.5). Cases were significantly more likely to have been previously hospitalized (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.5) and to have had a household member with MDR-TB (OR 5.1, 95% CI 2.1-12.5). These associations remained significant when separately controlled for being currently hospitalized or HIV-infection. Conclusions: MDR-TB was associated with previous treatment for TB, previous hospitalization, and having had a household member with MDR-TB, suggesting that TB control practices have been inadequate. Strengthening basic TB control practices, including expanding laboratory confirmation, directly observed therapy, and infection control, are critical to the prevention of MDR-TB.

10.1186_1471_2334_12_369	Comparison between the BACTEC MGIT 960 system and the agar proportion method for susceptibility testing of multidrug resistant tuberculosis strains in a high burden setting of South Africa	Background: The increasing problem of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) [ie resistant to at least isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF)] is becoming a global problem. Successful treatment outcome for MDR-TB depends on reliable and accurate drug susceptibility testing of first-line and second-line anti-TB drugs. Method: Consecutive M. tuberculosis isolates identified as MDR-TB during August 2007 to January 2008 using the BACTEC MGIT 960 systems and the agar proportion method were included in this study. Susceptibility testing of MDR-TB isolates against ethambutol (EMB) and streptomycin (STR) as well as two second-line anti-TB drugs, kanamycin (KAN) and ofloxacin (OFX) was performed using the BACTEC MGIT 960 systems at a routine diagnostic laboratory. The results were compared to those obtained by the agar proportion method. Result: The agreement between the BACTEC MGIT 960 system and the agar proportion method was 44% for EMB, 61% for STR and 89% for both KAN and OFX. The sensitivity and specificity of the BACTEC MGIT 960 system using the agar proportion method as a gold standard was 92% and 37% for EMB, 95% and 37% for STR, 27% and 97% for KAN and 84% and 90% for OFX, respectively. Conclusions: The BACTEC MGIT 960 system showed acceptable sensitivity for EMB, STR, and OFX; however, the BACTEC MGIT 960 system was less specific for EMB and STR and demonstrated a low sensitivity for KAN. The lower agreement found between the two methods suggests the unreliability of the BACTEC MGIT 960 system for the drugs tested. The reasons for the lower agreement between the two methods need to be investigated and further studies are needed in this setting to confirm the study finding.

pub-1084	Docking studies on novel alkaloid tryptanthrin and its analogues against enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Isoniazid resistance is a serious threat in the battle against the treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). Isoniazid is an inhibitor of enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is an important and functional enzyme of the type II fatty acid synthesis system and important therapeutic target. Natural alkaloid tryptanthrin and its analogues have shown anti-tubercular activity against MDR-TB, but their cellular target is unknown. In this work, in silico molecular docking was performed using docking server in order to see the interaction of tryptanthrin and its 15 analogues with InhA of M. tuberculosis. Results showed that among tryptanthrin and its 15 analogues, tryptanthrin and its two analogues exhibited good affinity to the binding site of InhA with free binding energy of -7.94 kcal/mol and inhibition constant (Ki) of 1.50 mu m. Active site residues of InhA interacting with tryptanthrin were Ser13, Thr39, Phe41, Leu63, Asp64, Val65, Ile95, Phe97 and Ile122. In binding mode, polar bond were found between O1 (1) with Asp64 of bond length (3.34 angstrom) and hydrophobic bonds were found between Leu63 with C15 and C12, Val65 with C7, Val65 with C12 and C4, Ile95 with C6 and C7, Ile95 with C10, C12 and C14. Important pi-pi bonds were found between Phe41 with C2, C5, C7, C12, C4, C6, C8, C9, C13 and Phe97 with C9. These interactions indicated stability of tryptanthrin in active residue and suggested it as a potential drug candidate. Thus, good affinity of tryptanthrin to binding site of InhA may lead to synthesis of anti-tubercular drug capable of combating MDR strains of M. tuberculosis.

pub-1085	Pulmonary Resection for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis: The Israeli Experience (1998-2011)	Background: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) presents a difficult therapeutic problem due to the failure of medical treatment. Pulmonary resection is an important adjunctive therapy for selected patients with MDR-TB. Objectives: To assess the efficacy of pulmonary resection in the management of MDR-TB patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of MDR-TB patients referred for major pulmonary resections as part of a treatment strategy. The operations were performed in the departments of thoracic surgery at Assaf Harofeh and Wolfson Medical Centers. For the period under study, 13 years (1998 2011), we analyzed patients' medical history, bacteriological, medical and surgical data, morbidity, mortality, and short-term and long-term outcome. Results: We identified 19 pulmonary resections (8 pneumonectomies, 4 lobectomies, 1 segmentectomy, 6 wedge resections) from among 17 patients, mostly men, with a mean age of 32.9 years (range 18-61 years). Postoperative complications developed in six patients (35.3%) (broncho-pleural fistula in one, empyema in two, prolonged air leak in two, and acute renal failure in one). Only one patient (5.8%) died during the early postoperative period, three (17.6%) in the late postoperative period, and one within 2 years after the resection. Of 12 survivors, 9 were cured, 2 are still under medical treatment, and 1 is lost from follow-up because of poor compliance. Conclusions: Pulmonary resection for MDR-TB patients is an effective adjunctive treatment with acceptable morbidity and mortality.

10.1371_journal.pmed.1001358	Research on Implementation of Interventions in Tuberculosis Control in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review	Background: Several interventions for tuberculosis (TB) control have been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) over the past decade. These include isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) for HIV-infected individuals and household contacts of infectious TB patients, diagnostic algorithms for rule-in or rule-out of smear-negative pulmonary TB, and programmatic treatment for multidrug-resistant TB. There is no systematically collected data on the type of evidence that is publicly available to guide the scale-up of these interventions in low-and middle-income countries. We investigated the availability of published evidence on their effectiveness, delivery, and cost-effectiveness that policy makers need for scaling-up these interventions at country level. Methods and Findings: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and several regional databases were searched for studies published from 1 January 1990 through 31 March 2012 that assessed health outcomes, delivery aspects, or cost-effectiveness for any of these interventions in low-or middle-income countries. Selected studies were evaluated for their objective(s), design, geographical and institutional setting, and generalizability. Studies reporting health outcomes were categorized as primarily addressing efficacy or effectiveness of the intervention. These criteria were used to draw landscapes of published research. We identified 59 studies on IPT in HIV infection, 14 on IPT in household contacts, 44 on rule-in diagnosis, 19 on rule-out diagnosis, and 72 on second-line treatment. Comparative effectiveness studies were relatively few (n = 9) and limited to South America and sub-Saharan Africa for IPT in HIV-infection, absent for IPT in household contacts, and rare for second-line treatment (n = 3). Evaluations of diagnostic and screening algorithms were more frequent (n = 19) but geographically clustered and mainly of non-comparative design. Fifty-four studies evaluated ways of delivering these interventions, and nine addressed their cost-effectiveness. Conclusions: There are substantial gaps in published evidence for scale-up for five WHO-recommended TB interventions settings at country level, which for many countries possibly precludes program-wide implementation of these interventions. There is a strong need for rigorous operational research studies to be carried out in programmatic settings to inform on best use of existing and new interventions in TB control.

Aim: To characterize the resistance to isoniazid (INH) in M tuberculosis. Methods: Phenotypic and genotypic methods were used to determine the contribution of mutations at 315 codon of katG gene to the phenotypic expression of resistance. The analysis of susceptibility to antibiotics was performed by the proportional method of Canetti and nitrate reductase method. Genotypic analysis of INH resistance was performed by PCR-RFLP. Results: 193 strains of M tuberculosis from patients with respiratory symptoms were analyzed. Nineteen (9.8%) strains resistant to INH were identified, of which 12 (63.2%) showed resistance to other drugs. Genotypic analysis allowed to detect the mutation S315T in the katG gene in 15 of 17 strains phenotypically resistant to INH, showing a sensitivity of 88.24%, 100% specificity, 100% positive predictive value, 92% negative predictive value and high concordance with phenotypic methods (kappa = 0.85 (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The S31ST mutation in the katG gene is the predominant mechanism of INH resistance in our circulating strains. This feature could be used as a rapid diagnostic tool with potential to detect at least 88% of isoniazid resistant strains, with great impact on the therapeutic management of patients.

10.5588_ijtld.12.0315	Lessons from a randomised clinical trial for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	BACKGROUND: The treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is currently based upon expert opinion and findings from case series, rather than upon randomised clinical trials (RCTs). OBJECTIVE: To describe the challenges encountered during an RCT for the treatment of MDR-TB. METHODS: Tuberculosis Trials Consortium Study 30 was a pilot, Phase I/II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, RCT of the safety and tolerability of 16 weeks of daily, low-dose linezolid treatment for MDR-TB. RESULTS: A total of 36 patients, 56% of the target of 64 patients, consented to participate, for an average of 0.69 enrolments per week. Of the 36 patients enrolled, only 25 (69%) completed at least 90 doses of study treatment. Among the 12 (33%) patients who did not complete all 112 doses of the study treatment, the median time to study withdrawal was 15 days (range 0-92). After the study, we discovered discordance between treatment assignment and study drug for at least 9 (25%) of the 36 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment and retention in this MDR-TB clinical trial posed substantial challenges, suggesting the need for a large, multidisciplinary group of study staff to support the participants. Withdrawal tended to occur early in study treatment. The discrepancy in assigned study medication reflects the need for stronger administrative controls for study drugs.	multidrug resistance; tuberculosis; HIV; clinical trial; treatment allocation; linezolid	EFFICACY; TB
10.1183_09031936.00022912	Efficacy, safety and tolerability of linezolid containing regimens in treating MDR-TB and XDR-TB: systematic review and meta-analysis	Linezolid is used off-label to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in absence of systematic evidence. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on efficacy, safety and tolerability of linezolid-containing regimes based on individual data analysis. 12 studies (11 countries from three continents) reporting complete information on safety, tolerability, efficacy of linezolid-containing regimes in treating MDR-TB cases were identified based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Meta-analysis was performed using the individual data of 121 patients with a definite treatment outcome (cure, completion, death or failure). Most MDR-TB cases achieved sputum smear (86 (92.5%) out of 93) and culture (100 (93.5%) out of 107) conversion after treatment with individualised regimens containing linezolid (median (inter-quartile range) times for smear and culture conversions were 43.5 (21-90) and 61 (29-119) days, respectively) and 99 (81.8%) out of 121 patients were successfully treated. No significant differences were detected in the subgroup efficacy analysis (daily linezolid dosage <= 600 mg versus >600 mg). Adverse events were observed in 63 (58.9%) out of 107 patients, of which 54 (68.4%) out of 79 were major adverse events that included anaemia (38.1%), peripheral neuropathy (47.1%), gastro-intestinal disorders (16.7%), optic neuritis (13.2%) and thrombocytopenia (11.8%). The proportion of adverse events was significantly higher when the linezolid daily dosage exceeded 600 mg. The study results suggest an excellent efficacy but also the necessity of caution in the prescription of linezolid.

10.1371_journal.pone.0049898	The Impact of Expanded Testing for Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis Using Geontype MTBDRplus in South Africa: An Observational Cohort Study	Introduction: Globally, multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) remains underdiagnosed. The Genotype MTBDRplus (R), a rapid drug susceptibility testing (DST) assay used to detect resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin in the diagnosis of MDR-TB, has good diagnostic accuracy, but its impact on patient outcomes in routine practice is unproven. We assessed the clinical impact of routine DST using MTBDRplus in a single health district in South Africa. Methods: Data were collected on all adult pulmonary TB patients registered at 25 public health clinics in the periods before and after introduction of an expanded DST algorithm using MTBDRplus version 1.0. Results: We collected data on 1176 TB patients before implementation and 1177 patients afterwards. In the before period, measured MDR-TB prevalence among new cases was 0.7% (95% CI1.4-3.1%), and among retreatment cases 6.2% (95% CI:3.5-8.8%), versus 3.7% (95% CI:2.4-5.0, p<0.01) and 6.6% (95% CI:3.8-9.4%, p = 0.83) respectively after MTBDRplus introduction. The median times from sputum collection to MDR treatment in the before and after periods were 78 days (IQR:52-93) and 62 days (IQR:32-86, p = 0.05), respectively. Among MDR-TB cases, 27% (95% CI:10-44) in the before period converted sputum cultures to negative by 8 months following treatment initiation, while 52% (95% CI:38-66) converted in the intervention period (p = 0.04). Conclusions: The expanded use of MTBDRplus DST resulted in a substantial increase in the proportion of new cases identified as MDR-TB; though time to MDR treatment was reduced, it was still over two months. Culture conversion for MDR-TB patients improved after introduction of MTBDRplus. This work illustrates the mixture of successes and challenges resulting from increased access to rapid DST in a setting with a high TB burden.		DIAGNOSIS; RIFAMPIN; MTB/RIF
10.1371_journal.pone.0049238	Should Sputum Smear Examination Be Carried Out at the End of the Intensive Phase and End of Treatment in Sputum Smear Negative Pulmonary TB Patients?	Background: The Indian guidelines on following up sputum smear-negative Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients differ from the current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines in that the former recommends two follow up sputum examinations (once at the end of intensive phase and the other at the end of treatment) while the latter recommends only one follow up sputum smear microscopy examination, which is done at the end of the intensive phase. This study was conducted to examine if there was any added value in performing an additional sputum smear examination at the end of treatment within the context of a national TB program. Methods: This study was a descriptive record based review conducted in nine tuberculosis (TB) units in Delhi, India. All consecutive new sputum smear-negative PTB patients registered in these nine TB units from 1st January 2009 to 31st December 2009 were included in the study. Results: Of 2567 new sputum smear-negative TB patients, 1973 (90%) had sputum specimens examined at the end of the intensive phase, of whom 36 (2%) were smear-positive: the majority (n = 28) successfully completed treatment with either the same or a re-treatment regimen. At treatment completion, 1766 (85%) patients had sputum specimens examined, of whom 16 (0.9%) were smear-positive: all these were changed to a re-treatment regimen. Amongst the sputum-positive patients identified as a result of follow up (n = 52), four were diagnosed with multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), three of whom were detected after smear examination at the end of treatment. Conclusions: Given the high burden of TB in India, a 0.9% additional yield of smear-positive sputum smears at the end of treatment translates to 3,297 cases of smear-positive PTB. End-of-treatment smear is a low-yield strategy for detection of smear-positive TB cases, although further studies are needed to determine its population-level impact and cost, particularly in relation to other TB control interventions.		
10.1186_1472_6947_12_125	Adaptation of a web-based, open source electronic medical record system platform to support a large study of tuberculosis epidemiology	Background: In 2006, we were funded by the US National Institutes of Health to implement a study of tuberculosis epidemiology in Peru. The study required a secure information system to manage data from a target goal of 16,000 subjects who needed to be followed for at least one year. With previous experience in the development and deployment of web-based medical record systems for TB treatment in Peru, we chose to use the OpenMRS open source electronic medical record system platform to develop the study information system. Supported by a core technical and management team and a large and growing worldwide community, OpenMRS is now being used in more than 40 developing countries. We adapted the OpenMRS platform to better support foreign languages. We added a new module to support double data entry, linkage to an existing laboratory information system, automatic upload of GPS data from handheld devices, and better security and auditing of data changes. We added new reports for study managers, and developed data extraction tools for research staff and statisticians. Further adaptation to handle direct entry of laboratory data occurred after the study was launched. Results: Data collection in the OpenMRS system began in September 2009. By August 2011 a total of 9,256 participants had been enrolled, 102,274 forms and 13,829 laboratory results had been entered, and there were 208 users. The system is now entirely supported by the Peruvian study staff and programmers. Conclusions: The information system served the study objectives well despite requiring some significant adaptations mid-stream. OpenMRS has more tools and capabilities than it did in 2008, and requires less adaptations for future projects. OpenMRS can be an effective research data system in resource poor environments, especially for organizations using or considering it for clinical care as well as research.

10.1371_journal.pone.0048599	Impact of Xpert MTB/RIF Testing on Tuberculosis Management and Outcomes in Hospitalized Patients in Uganda	Rationale: The clinical impact of Xpert MTB/RIF for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis in high HIV-prevalence settings is unknown. Objective: To determine the diagnostic accuracy and impact of Xpert MTB/RIF among high-risk TB suspects. Methods: We prospectively enrolled consecutive, hospitalized, Ugandan TB suspects in two phases: baseline phase in which Xpert MTB/RIF results were not reported to clinicians and an implementation phase in which results were reported. We determined the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF in reference to culture (solid and liquid) and compared patient outcomes by study phase. Results: 477 patients were included (baseline phase 287, implementation phase 190). Xpert MTB/RIF had high sensitivity (187/237, 79%, 95% CI: 73-84%) and specificity (190/199, 96%, 95% CI: 92-98%) for culture-positive TB overall, but sensitivity was lower (34/81, 42%, 95% CI: 31-54%) among smear-negative TB cases. Xpert MTB/RIF reduced median days-to-TB detection for all TB cases (1 [IQR 0-26] vs. 0 [IQR 0-1], p < 0.001), and for smear-negative TB (35 [IQR 22-55] vs. 22 [IQR 0-33], p = 0.001). However, median days-to-TB treatment was similar for all TB cases (1 [IQR 0-5] vs. 0 [IQR 0-2], p = 0.06) and for smear-negative TB (7 [IQR 3-53] vs. 6 [IQR 1-61], p = 0.78). Two-month mortality was also similar between study phases among 252 TB cases (17% vs. 14%, difference +3%, 95% CI: -21% to +27%, p = 0.80), and among 87 smear-negative TB cases (28% vs. 22%, difference +6%, 95% CI: -34 to +46%, p = 0.77). Conclusions: Xpert MTB/RIF facilitated more accurate and earlier TB diagnosis, leading to a higher proportion of TB suspects with a confirmed TB diagnosis prior to hospital discharge in a high HIV/low MDR TB prevalence setting. However, our study did not detect a decrease in two-month mortality following implementation of Xpert MTB/RIF possibly because of insufficient powering, differences in empiric TB treatment rates, and disease severity between study phases.

10.1371_journal.pmed.1001348	Screening and Rapid Molecular Diagnosis of Tuberculosis in Prisons in Russia and Eastern Europe: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis	Background: Prisons of the former Soviet Union (FSU) have high rates of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and are thought to drive general population tuberculosis (TB) epidemics. Effective prison case detection, though employing more expensive technologies, may reduce long-term treatment costs and slow MDR-TB transmission. Methods and Findings: We developed a dynamic transmission model of TB and drug resistance matched to the epidemiology and costs in FSU prisons. We evaluated eight strategies for TB screening and diagnosis involving, alone or in combination, self-referral, symptom screening, mass miniature radiography (MMR), and sputum PCR with probes for rifampin resistance (Xpert MTB/RIF). Over a 10-y horizon, we projected costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and TB and MDR-TB prevalence. Using sputum PCR as an annual primary screening tool among the general prison population most effectively reduced overall TB prevalence (from 2.78% to 2.31%) and MDR-TB prevalence (from 0.74% to 0.63%), and cost US$543/QALY for additional QALYs gained compared to MMR screening with sputum PCR reserved for rapid detection of MDR-TB. Adding sputum PCR to the currently used strategy of annual MMR screening was cost-saving over 10 y compared to MMR screening alone, but produced only a modest reduction in MDR-TB prevalence (from 0.74% to 0.69%) and had minimal effect on overall TB prevalence (from 2.78% to 2.74%). Strategies based on symptom screening alone were less effective and more expensive than MMR-based strategies. Study limitations included scarce primary TB time-series data in FSU prisons and uncertainties regarding screening test characteristics. Conclusions: In prisons of the FSU, annual screening of the general inmate population with sputum PCR most effectively reduces TB and MDR-TB prevalence, doing so cost-effectively. If this approach is not feasible, the current strategy of annual MMR is both more effective and less expensive than strategies using self-referral or symptom screening alone, and the addition of sputum PCR for rapid MDR-TB detection may be cost-saving over time.

10.1016_j.tube.2012.07.005	Molecular mechanism of rifampicin and isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis from Bangladesh	Despite having 100% coverage of directly observed treatment short-course, multi drug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) is still increasing in Bangladesh. Early detection of MDR-TB by rapid molecular test and early initiation of treatment will effectively stop this trend. To develop rapid diagnostic tools, molecular characterization of genes conferring Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) will be required. Hence, this study elucidated the molecular mechanism RIF and INH resistance in 218 MDR strains from hospitalized (n = 161) and non-hospitalized (n = 57) TB patients in Bangladesh. Mutations in rpoB gene were detected in 207 (95.0%) with majority at codon 531 (52.3%). Mutations in katG or inhA or both were detected in 206 (94.5%) with majority at codon 315 of katG (83.9%). It was noteworthy that a novel C to T mutation at position 34 and G to A mutations at position -47 in inhA regulatory region were found, respectively, in combination with mutation at codon 315 of katG. This is the first comprehensive molecular analysis of rpoB and katG genes and inhA regulatory regions of MDR isolates from Bangladesh. This study provides basic data for the construction of low cost tailor-made molecular system for rapid diagnosis of MDR-TB in Bangladesh. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.1016_j.jinf.2012.06.007	Genomic sequence based scanning for drug resistance-associated mutations and evolutionary analysis of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Objective: To better understand the molecular mechanisms and evolution of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), we performed a genomic sequence based scanning of drug resistance-associated loci for multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) M. tuberculosis strains. Materials and methods: Forty-five pairs of primers covering known drug resistance-associated loci compiled in the TBDReaMDB database were designed to perform the analysis of drug resistance-associated mutations for 14 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates from TB patients in China. Genetic diversity and evolutionary analysis was done using concatenated nucleotide sequences of drug resistance-associated loci. Results: Forty-four types of mutations were identified in 14 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates. Average nucleotide diversity for drug resistance-associated loci increased in the M. tuberculosis isolates as the drug resistance increased (pi = 0, pi = 0.00021, and pi = 0.00028 for susceptible, MDR, and XDR isolates, respectively). The dN/dS ratios for coding regions of drug resistance-associated genes in MDR and XDR isolates were 2.73 and 1.83, respectively. MDR and XDR isolates were distributed sporadically on different branches in the phylogenetic trees. Conclusions: Our study provides supporting evidence to demonstrate that the MDR- and XDR-M. tuberculosis strains have evolved independently driven by positive selection.

10.5588_ijtld.12.0122	Risk and outcome of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: vitamin D receptor polymorphisms and serum 25(OH)D	SETTING: All India Institute of Medical Sciences and Rajan Babu Institute of Pulmonary Medicine and Tuberculosis, New Delhi, India. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms and scrum 25(OH)D with susceptibility to, and response to treatment of, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in comparison with drug-susceptible pulmonary TB (DS-PTB) and healthy controls. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A total of 897 participants from northern India were consecutively enrolled into three groups (MDR-TB 354, DS-PTB 338, controls 205). Genotypic and allelic frequencies of FokI, BsmI and TaqI VDR polymorphisms, and serum 25(OH)D, calcium and intact parathyroid hormone were measured in all participants. In those with active TB, disease severity, time to sputum smear and culture conversion were correlated with VDR genotype and biochemical parameters. RESULTS: FokI Ff genotype and TaqI t allele correlated positively with MDR-TB; ff genotype and f allele of FokI frequency were higher in both TB groups. BsmI Bb genotype correlated inversely with MDR-TB. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly lowest in MDR-TB, correlating inversely with time to sputum smear conversion. CONCLUSIONS: VDR gene polymorphisms and hypovitaminosis D may predispose to MDR-TB. Lower serum 25(OH)D may increase time to MDR-TB sputum smear negativity.	serum calcium; intact parathyroid hormone; drug-susceptible TB; vitamin D deficiency	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; D DEFICIENCY; GENE POLYMORPHISMS; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; DOUBLE-BLIND; ASSOCIATION; SUSCEPTIBILITY; METAANALYSIS; VARIANTS; DISEASE
10.5588_ijtld.12.0026	Alcohol use and abuse among patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Botswana	BACKGROUND: Data on alcohol abuse as a risk factor for the development of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To describe the patterns of alcohol use in MDR-TB patients and to determine whether alcohol use is associated with the development of MDR-TB in Botswana. METHODS: We compared the level of alcohol use among MDR-TB patients against three control groups: 1) non-MDR-TB patients, 2) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients without a history of TB, and 3) the general population. Alcohol use and abuse was measured with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test 10 (AUDIT) questionnaire. RESULTS: Of a total national population of 164 MDR-TB cases, 114 (70%) were interviewed. MDR-TB cases had a lifetime prevalence of alcohol use of 35.1%, which was lower than that of all control groups (P < 0.001). MDR-TB cases had higher 1-month prevalence of alcohol dependence symptoms and a lower 1-year period prevalence of alcohol dependence symptoms (P < 0.01 and P = 0.01 respectively). Among patients with TB, alcohol abuse was found to be a risk factor for the development of MDR-TB. CONCLUSION: MDR-TB patients in Botswana have high rates of alcohol use and abuse. Among TB patients, alcohol abuse is associated with the diagnosis of MDR-TB, and could be an important modifiable factor.	tuberculosis; multidrug resistance; alcohol; case control	USE DISORDERS IDENTIFICATION; SOUTH-AFRICA; RISK-FACTORS; RUSSIA; TOMSK; CONSUMPTION; TRIAL; WOMEN
10.1128_AAC.01300_12	Pyrazinamide May Improve Fluoroquinolone-Based Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	The role of pyrazinamide in the current treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) is uncertain. From a territory-wide registry of MDR-TB cases diagnosed between 1995 and 2009, we assembled a cohort of 194 patients with MDR pulmonary TB given fluoroquinolone-containing regimens. Stratified by pyrazinamide use and susceptibility, there were 83 users with pyrazinamide-susceptible MDR-TB (subgroup A), 24 users with pyrazinamide-resistant MDR-TB (subgroup B), 40 nonusers with pyrazinamide-susceptible MDR-TB (subgroup C), and 47 nonusers with pyrazinamide-resistant MDR-TB (subgroup D). We estimated the adjusted risk ratio (ARR) of early sputum culture conversion (ARR-culture) that occurred within 90 days posttreatment and that of cure or treatment completion (ARR-success) that occurred by 2 years posttreatment due to pyrazinamide use with susceptibility. In comparison with subgroup B, ARR-culture and ARR-success were 1.38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89 to 2.12) and 1.38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88 to 2.17), respectively. Corresponding findings were 0.99 (95% CI, 0.81 to 1.22) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.26) in comparison with subgroup C and 1.09 (95% CI, 0.84 to 1.42) and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.74 to 1.20) in comparison with subgroup D. Early culture conversion significantly increased the incidence proportion of cure or treatment completion by 71% (95% CI, 26% to 133%). Selection bias among pyrazinamide nonusers might have underestimated the role of pyrazinamide. Comparison of pyrazinamide users showed that pyrazinamide increased the incidence proportion of early culture conversion and that of cure or treatment completion by a best estimate of 38% for both. This magnitude of change exceeded the 15 to 20% increase in the 2-month culture conversion rate of drug-susceptible TB that results from adding pyrazinamide to isoniazid and rifampin. Pyrazinamide is likely important in fluoroquinolone-based treatment of MDR-TB.

10.1128_AAC.01054_12	Dried Blood Spot Analysis for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Linezolid in Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Linezolid is a promising antimicrobial agent for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), but its use is limited by toxicity. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may help to minimize toxicity while adequate drug exposure is maintained. Conventional plasma sampling and monitoring might be hindered in many parts of the world by logistical problems that may be solved by dried blood spot (DBS) sampling. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a novel method for TDM of linezolid in MDR-TB patients using DBS sampling. Plasma, venous DBS, and capillary DBS specimens were obtained simultaneously from eight patients receiving linezolid. A DBS sampling method was developed and clinically validated by comparing DBS with plasma results using Passing-Bablok regression and Bland-Altman analysis. This study showed that DBS analysis was reproducible and robust. Accuracy and between- and within-day precision values from three validations presented as bias and coefficient of variation (CV) were less than 17.2% for the lower limit of quantification and less than 7.8% for other levels. The method showed a high recovery of approximately 95% and a low matrix effect of less than 8.7%. DBS specimens were stable at 37 degrees C for 2 months and at 50 degrees C for 1 week. The ratio of the concentration of linezolid in DBS samples to that in plasma was 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12 to 1.27). Linezolid exposure calculated from concentrations DBS samples and plasma showed good agreement. In conclusion, DBS analysis of linezolid is a promising tool to optimize linezolid treatment in MDR-TB patients. An easy sampling procedure and high sample stability may facilitate TDM, even in underdeveloped countries with limited resources and where conventional plasma sampling is not feasible.

10.3201_eid1811.120126	HIV Infection and Geographically Bound Transmission of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis, Argentina	During 2003-2009, the National Tuberculosis (TB) Laboratory Network in Argentina gave 830 patients a new diagnosis of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB and 53 a diagnosis of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. HIV co-infection was involved in nearly one third of these cases. Strain genotyping showed that 7 major clusters gathered 56% of patients within restricted geographic areas. The 3 largest clusters corresponded to epidemic MDR TB strains that have been undergoing transmission for >10 years. The indigenous M strain accounted for 29% and 40% of MDR and XDR TB cases, respectively. Drug-resistant TB trends in Argentina are driven by spread of a few strains in hotspots where the rate of HIV infection is high. To curb transmission, the national TB program is focusing stringent interventions in these areas by strengthening infection control in large hospitals and prisons, expediting drug resistance detection, and streamlining information-sharing systems between HIV and TB programs.

10.1371_journal.pmed.1001347	Population Health Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Tuberculosis Diagnosis with Xpert MTB/RIF: A Dynamic Simulation and Economic Evaluation	Background: The Xpert MTB/RIF test enables rapid detection of tuberculosis (TB) and rifampicin resistance. The World Health Organization recommends Xpert for initial diagnosis in individuals suspected of having multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) or HIV-associated TB, and many countries are moving quickly toward adopting Xpert. As roll-out proceeds, it is essential to understand the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies based on Xpert. Methods and Findings: We evaluated potential health and economic consequences of implementing Xpert in five southern African countries-Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland-where drug resistance and TB-HIV coinfection are prevalent. Using a calibrated, dynamic mathematical model, we compared the status quo diagnostic algorithm, emphasizing sputum smear, against an algorithm incorporating Xpert for initial diagnosis. Results were projected over 10- and 20-y time periods starting from 2012. Compared to status quo, implementation of Xpert would avert 132,000 (95% CI: 55,000-284,000) TB cases and 182,000 (97,000-302,000) TB deaths in southern Africa over the 10 y following introduction, and would reduce prevalence by 28% (14%-40%) by 2022, with more modest reductions in incidence. Health system costs are projected to increase substantially with Xpert, by US$ 460 million (294-699 million) over 10 y. Antiretroviral therapy for HIV represents a substantial fraction of these additional costs, because of improved survival in TB/HIV-infected populations through better TB case-finding and treatment. Costs for treating MDR-TB are also expected to rise significantly with Xpert scale-up. Relative to status quo, Xpert has an estimated cost-effectiveness of US$ 959 (633-1,485) per disability-adjusted life-year averted over 10 y. Across countries, cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from US$ 792 (482-1,785) in Swaziland to US$ 1,257 (767-2,276) in Botswana. Assessing outcomes over a 10-y period focuses on the near-term consequences of Xpert adoption, but the cost-effectiveness results are conservative, with cost-effectiveness ratios assessed over a 20-y time horizon approximately 20% lower than the 10-y values. Conclusions: Introduction of Xpert could substantially change TB morbidity and mortality through improved case-finding and treatment, with more limited impact on long-term transmission dynamics. Despite extant uncertainty about TB natural history and intervention impact in southern Africa, adoption of Xpert evidently offers reasonable value for its cost, based on conventional benchmarks for cost-effectiveness. However, the additional financial burden would be substantial, including significant increases in costs for treating HIV and MDR-TB. Given the fundamental influence of HIV on TB dynamics and intervention costs, care should be taken when interpreting the results of this analysis outside of settings with high HIV prevalence.

10.4187_respcare.01532	The Functional Assessment of Patients With Pulmonary Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) remains an important public health problem worldwide, as its residual lesions result in functional and quality of life impairments. Few studies have investigated multiple-drug-resistant pulmonary TB (MDR-TB), and the literature regarding the functional parameters of this group of patients is scarce. Functional characterization may point to the need for post-treatment intervention measures that optimize the quality of life in patients with MDR-TB. Thus, this study sought to analyze the respiratory function, functional capacity, and quality of life of patients who were treated for MDR pulmonary TB. METHODS: This study investigated a cross-sectional cohort of MDR-TB patients who underwent drug treatment for at least 18 months. Patients who had associated diseases (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], severe heart disease, and hypertension) or disabilities that prevented them from walking were excluded. The subjects underwent the following assessments: forced spirometry, a chest radiograph, the 6-min walk test, a bioelectrical impedance analysis, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures, and a health-related quality of life questionnaire. RESULTS: Eighteen patients who met the eligibility criteria were enrolled. Spirometric evaluation showed that 78% of the subjects had abnormal patterns. The maximal respiratory pressures were significantly decreased in all subjects, despite the fact that their nutritional status was within the normal range. The distance completed in the 6-min walk test was less than expected in 72% of the subjects. All of the subjects who were evaluated had residual lesions, and 78% reported a worsening in their quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion MDR-TB cured subjects exhibit impaired respiratory function and a mildly reduced functional capacity and quality of life, suggesting that a portion of these patients may require a pulmonary rehabilitation approach.	tuberculosis; TB; multiple-drug-resistant; pulmonary; quality of life; respiratory function; pulmonary; rehabilitation	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; 6-MINUTE WALK; LUNG-FUNCTION; ASSOCIATION; DISEASE; ADULTS; REHABILITATION; POPULATION; GUIDELINES; DISABILITY
10.1371_journal.pone.0046943	Outcomes of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment with Early Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV Co-Infected Patients in Lesotho	Background: Although the importance of concurrent treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and HIV co-infection has been increasingly recognized, there have been few studies reporting outcomes of MDR-TB and HIV co-treatment. We report final outcomes of comprehensive, integrated MDR-TB and HIV treatment in Lesotho and examine factors associated with death or treatment failure. Methods: We reviewed clinical charts of all adult patients who initiated MDR-TB treatment in Lesotho between January 2008 and September 2009. We calculated hazard ratios (HR) and used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to identify predictors of poor outcomes. Results: Of 134 confirmed MDR-TB patients, 83 (62%) were cured or completed treatment, 46 (34%) died, 3 (2%) transferred, 1 (1%) defaulted, and 1 (1%) failed treatment. Treatment outcomes did not differ significantly by HIV status. Among the 94 (70%) patients with HIV co-infection, 53% were already on antiretroviral therapy (ART) before MDR-TB treatment initiation, and 43% started ART a median of 16 days after the start of the MDR-TB regimen. Among HIV co-infected patients who died, those who had not started ART before MDR-TB treatment had a shorter median time to death (80 days vs. 138 days, p = 0.065). In multivariable analysis, predictors of increased hazard of failure or death were low and severely low body mass index (HR 2.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-5.93; HR 5.50, 95% CI 2.38-12.69), and a history of working in South Africa (HR 2.37, 95% CI 1.24-4.52). Conclusions: Favorable outcomes can be achieved in co-infected patients using a community-based treatment model when both MDR-TB and HIV disease are treated concurrently and treatment is initiated promptly.

10.1186_1471_2334_12_266	Long term follow-up of drug resistant and drug susceptible tuberculosis contacts in a Low incidence setting	Background: Studies examining the transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains have yielded conflicting results. Methods: We examined transmission of MDR-TB strains using contact tracing data from a low incidence setting. Contacts of MDR-TB cases diagnosed in British Columbia, Canada, from 1990-2008 were identified through a provincial tuberculosis (TB) registry. Tuberculin skin test (TST) results and TB disease incident rates were determined for contacts. For comparison, TB disease incident rates and TST results were measured in close contacts of isoniazid mono-resistant (HMR-TB) and drug susceptible TB (DS-TB) cases. Results: Of 89 identified close contacts of MDR-TB patients, 5 patients (6%) developed TB disease and 42 (47%) were TST positive. The incidence rate of TB disease (3%, p = 0.31) and TST positivity (49%, p = 0.82) were similar in contacts of HMR-TB cases. Compared with MDR-TB contacts, DS-TB contacts had lower incidence rate of TB disease (2%, p = 0.04) and TST positivity (32%, p < 0.01). All MDR-TB contacts with culture positive TB diagnosed in follow-up were drug-susceptible; three of six HMR-TB contacts with culture positive TB were HMR-TB. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that contact with MDR-TB (adjusted OR 1.72; 95%CI 1.05-2.81) and HMR-TB (adjusted OR 1.99; 95%CI 1.48-2.67) was associated with TST positivity. In addition, adult age, male gender, BCG positivity, source case sputum smear positivity, foreign birth and fewer contacts per source case were significantly associated with TST positivity in the multivariate model. Conclusion: Contacts of MDR-TB and HMR-TB patients in a low incidence setting show high rates of TST positivity and TB disease but low rates of drug resistance.

10.1186_1471_2334_12_262	Tuberculosis in Kazakhstan: analysis of risk determinants in national surveillance data	"Background: Development of tuberculosis (TB) is determined by various risk factors and the interactions of temporal and spatial distributions. The aim of this study was to identify the most salient risk factors for TB disease as well as multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) at the oblast (provincial) level in Kazakhstan. Methods: Correlational and descriptive analyses were conducted at the oblast and national level using data provided by the country's National Institute of Geography (NIG) and the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP). Reported incident case notification rates (CNRs) and prevalence vary by oblast, thus the study investigated which determinants contributed to this regional variation and compared burdens among oblasts. Results: The results showed that while tuberculosis CNRs decreased over the study period, MDR-TB conversely increased. Two oblasts-Atyrauskaya and Mangystauskaya - presented especially significant anomalies with large decreases in TB incident CNRs coupled with comparatively large increases in MDR-TB incident CNRs. Conclusion: Understanding the distribution of TB and MDR-TB cases and associated risk factors, especially the ""unknown risk factor"" categorization points to the need for future research."

10.1021_jm300828h	Identification of Less Lipophilic Riminophenazine Derivatives for the Treatment of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Clofazimine (CFZ), a member of the riminophenazine class, has been studied in clinical trials for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). CFZ has several side effects which can be attributed to its extremely high lipophilicity. A series of novel riminophenazine analogues bearing a C-2 pyridyl substituent was designed and synthesized with the goal of maintaining potent activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) while improving upon its safety profile by lowering the lipophilicity. All compounds were evaluated for their in vitro activity and cytotoxicity. The results demonstrated that many new compounds had potent activity against M. tuberculosis with MICs of less than 0.03 mu g/mL and low cytotoxicity with IC50 values greater than 64 mu g/mL. Some compounds were tested for in vivo efficacy against MDR-TB in an experimental mouse infection model. Two compounds demonstrated equivalent or better efficacy than CFZ in this model with significantly reduced skin discoloration potential.		CLOFAZIMINE ANALOGS; PHENAZINES; DISCOVERY; SERIES
10.1586_ERI.12.108	Rediscovering high technology from the past: thoracic surgery is back on track for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Expert Rev. Anti Infect. Ther. 10(10), 1109-1115 (2012) Evaluation of: Man MA, Nicolau D. Surgical treatment to increase the success rate of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Eur. J. Cardiothorac. Surg. 42, e9-e12 (2012). The global emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB represents a core challenge for global tuberculosis control. MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistant TB are more difficult to treat and have a worse outcome compared with drug-susceptible disease. Surgery has proved to improve treatment success in MDR-TB patients. This study was designed to assess the impact of surgery in a cohort of MDR-TB patients. The authors evaluate one of the largest cohorts treated by a single center, demonstrating that specialized thoracic surgery centers may achieve excellent results with a low rate of complications after surgery, and proposing an effective model of teamwork based on pulmonologists and surgeons. A review of the evidence supporting the role of surgery in addition to chemotherapy to improve treatment outcomes in difficult-to-treat cases of TB is also performed.	extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; surgical treatment; thoracotomy	PULMONARY RESECTION; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; METAANALYSIS
10.4103_0255_0857.103761	Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from pediatric population of Chennai, India	Purpose: Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) has been reported in almost all parts of the world. Childhood TB is accorded low priority by national TB control programs. Probable reasons include diagnostic difficulties, limited resources, misplaced faith in BCG and lack of data on treatment. Good data on the burden of all forms of TB among children in India are not available. Objective: To study the drug sensitivity pattern of tuberculosis in children aged from 3 months to 18 years and the outcome of drug-resistant tuberculosis by BACTEC culture system and PCR-based DNA sequencing technique. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study. One hundred and fifty-nine clinical specimens were processed for Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Mycobacterial culture by BACTEC method, phenotypic DST for first-line drugs for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) isolates and PCR-based DNA sequencing was performed for the M. tuberculosis isolates targeting rpoB, katG, inhA, oxyR-ahpC, rpsL, rrs and pncA. Results and Conclusion: Out of the 159 Mycobacterial cultures performed during the study period, 17 clinical specimens (10.7%) were culture positive for M. tuberculosis. Among the 17 M. tuberculosis isolates, 2 were multidrug-resistant TB. PCR-based DNA sequencing revealed the presence of many novel mutations targeting katG, inhA, oxyR-ahpC and pncA and the most commonly reported mutation Ser531Leu in the rpoB gene. This study underlines the urgent need to take efforts to develop methods for rapid detection and drug susceptibility of tubercle bacilli in the pediatric population.

10.1016_j.ijid.2012.06.001	Assessing the transmission risk of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis epidemics in regions of Taiwan	Objective: The objective of this study was to link transmission dynamics with a probabilistic risk model to provide a mechanistically explicit assessment for estimating the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) infection risk in regions of Taiwan. Methods: A relative fitness (RF)-based MDR TB model was used to describe transmission, validated with disease data for the period 2006-2010. A dose-response model quantifying by basic reproduction number (R-0) and total proportion of infected population was constructed to estimate the site-specific MDR TB infection risk. Results: We found that the incidence rate of MDR TB was highest in Hwalien County (4.91 per 100 000 population) in eastern Taiwan, with drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant R-0 estimates of 0.89 (95% CI 0.23-2.17) and 0.38 (95% CI 0.05-1.30), respectively. The predictions were in apparent agreement with observed data in the 95% credible intervals. Our simulation showed that the incidence of MDR TB will be falling by 2013-2016. Our results indicated that the selected regions of Taiwan had only similar to 1% probability of exceeding 50% of the population with infection attributed to MDR TB. Conclusions: Our study found that the ongoing control programs implemented in Taiwan may succeed in curing most patients with MDR TB and will reduce the TB incidence countrywide.

10.5588_ijtld.12.0092	Long-term follow-up of contacts exposed to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Victoria, Australia, 1995-2010	SETTING: The effectiveness of public health strategies following exposure to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is not clear. OBJECTIVE: To perform long-term follow-up of MDR-TB contacts and review individual outcomes and management approaches. DESIGN: Retrospective review of MDR-TB contacts identified by the Victorian Department of Health from 1995 to 2010. Health records, including personal medical and pharmacy records and statewide clinical and laboratory TB databases, were searched to identify management strategies and individual outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 570 contacts of 47 MDR-TB cases were identified, with a total follow-up period of 3093 person-years of observation (PYO) since exposure. Of 570 contacts, 49 (8.6%) were considered likely to have been infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis from index cases, and 11/49 (22.5%) of these were prescribed preventive therapy tailored to isolate susceptibility. No MDR-TB cases occurred in those receiving preventive treatment, while two cases were observed in those not treated (incidence 2878/100 000 PYO during the first 2 years post exposure). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of MDR-TB transmission to close contacts in this low-prevalence setting highlights the potential for public health strategies involving preventive treatment.	tuberculosis; drug resistant; contact tracing; public health	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; RISK; COHORT
10.5588_ijtld.12.0038	Screening outcomes from patients with suspected multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: lessons learned in the Philippines	SETTING: The high prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the Philippines is a challenge for the National TB Programme. OBJECTIVE: To assess patterns of drug resistance and screening outcomes among MDR-TB suspects evaluated from 2003 to 2008 at DOTS-Plus clinics in the Philippines. METHODS: Descriptive study of 4897 consecutive patients with suspected MDR-TB. RESULTS: The median time from the first visit until a diagnosis of drug-resistant TB was 132 days (IQR 110-166 days). Among patients screened for MDR-TB, the most frequent resistance pattern among those previously treated in DOTS facilities was resistance to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP). Resistance to INH+RMP plus fluoroquinolones was the most common pattern among those who had failed Category II treatment and patients treated by non-DOTS facilities. Among patients with MDR-TB, 57% ultimately received appropriate treatment with second-line drugs. The remaining 43% were lost to follow-up (25%), died (14%) or refused treatment (4%). CONCLUSION: Resistance to INH+RMP is the most frequent resistance pattern among patients referred from DOTS clinics in the Philippines for suspected MDR-TB. Initial use of standard regimens based on national survey data and quick uptake of new rapid molecular resistance tests may be useful to reduce diagnostic delays and expedite treatment for drug-resistant TB.

10.5588_ijtld.11.0812	Impact of second-line drug resistance on tuberculosis treatment outcomes in the United States: MDR-TB is bad enough	SETTING: The worldwide emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) has focused attention on treatment with second-line drugs (SLDs). OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact on outcomes of resistance to individual SLDs, we analyzed successful treatment completion and death among drug-resistant TB cases in the US national TB surveillance system, 1993-2007 (N = 195518). DESIGN: We defined four combinations of first-line drug (FLD) resistance based on isoniazid (INH) and rifamycin, and three patterns of SLD resistance: fluoroquinolones, injectable SLDs and other oral SLDs. We compared treatment outcomes of cases by FLD resistance, with and without each pattern of SLD resistance. RESULTS: In all but one instance, cases with FLD resistance but no SLD resistance had better outcomes than cases with SLD resistance. Rifamycin resistance, alone or with INH, resulted in a greater decline in treatment completion and greater increase in deaths than resistance to SLDs. Among patients with multidrug-resistant TB, additional resistance to injectable SLDs was statistically significant. Outcomes were better for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative than HIV-positive cases for all resistance patterns, but improved among HIV-infected cases after 1998, when highly active antiretroviral treatment became widely available. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the effect of rifamycin resistance may outweigh the more modest effects of resistance to specific SLDs.	drug-resistant TB; treatment outcomes; second-line resistance	SURVEILLANCE
10.5588_ijtld.11.0811	Predictors of sputum culture conversion among patients treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of initial sputum culture conversion, estimate the usefulness of persistent positive cultures at different time points in predicting treatment failure, and evaluate different definitions of culture conversion for predicting failure among patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in five countries, 2000-2004. METHODS: Predictors of time to conversion were identified using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. Receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted to visualize the effect of using different definitions of 'culture conversion' on the balance between sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Overall, 1209/1416 (85%) of patients with baseline positive cultures converted in a median of 3.0 months (interquartile range 2.0-5.0). Independent predictors of less likely conversion included baseline positive smear (hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95%CI 0.53-0.68), resistance to pyrazinamide (HR 0.82, 95%CI 0.70-0.96), fluoroquinolones (FQs; HR 0.65, 95%CI 0.51-0.83) or thioamide (HR 0.83, 95%CI 0.71-0.96), previous use of FQs (HR 0.71, 95%CI 0.60-0.83), poor outcome of previous anti-tuberculosis treatment (HR 0.69, 95%CI 0.54-0.88) and alcoholism (HR 0.74, 95%CI 0.63-0.87). The maximum combined sensitivity (84%) and specificity (94%) in predicting treatment failure was based on lack of culture conversion at month 9 of treatment, assuming conversion is defined as five consecutive negative cultures. CONCLUSION: Patients with identified risk factors were less likely to achieve sputum culture conversion during MDR-TB treatment.

10.3346_jkms.2012.27.10.1143	Proportion of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Mycobacterium tuberculosis Co-Infected Patients in Korea	Much controversy surrounds the issue of whether HIV infection is a risk factor for developing multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of and risk factors for MDR-TB in HIV-infected patients at the National Medical Center of Korea. We reviewed the medical records of HIV/TB co-infected patients from January 2005 to May 2011; the drug susceptibility profiles were available for 55 patients. Of these, 32.7% had MDR-TB, which was approximately 3.6 times higher than the prevalence among the general population. Additionally, there were more additional AIDS-defining clinical illnesses in the MDR-TB group than in the non-MDR-TB group (27.8% vs 5.4%, P = 0.032). These results suggest that HIV infection and HIV-related immunosuppresion may contribute to the development of MDR-TB.

10.1016_j.meegid.2012.04.021	Implication of the RDRio Mycobacterium tuberculosis sublineage in multidrug resistant tuberculosis in Portugal	Multidrug and extensively drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis are a threat to tuberculosis control programs. Genotyping methods, such as spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR typing (Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units), are useful in monitoring potentially epidemic strains and estimating strain phylogenetic lineages and/or genotypic families. M. tuberculosis Latin American Mediterranean (LAM) family is a major worldwide contributor to tuberculosis (TB). LAM specific molecular markers, Ag85C(103) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and RDRio long-sequence polymorphism (LSP), were used to characterize spoligotype signatures from 859 patient isolates from Portugal. LAM strains were found responsible for 57.7% of all tuberculosis cases. Strains with the RDRio deletion (referred to as RDRio) were estimated to represent 1/3 of all the strains and over 60% of the multidrug resistant (MDR) strains. The major spoligotype signature SIT20 belonging to the LAM1 RDRio sublineage, represented close to 1/5th of all the strains, over 20% of which were MDR. Analysis of published datasets according to stipulated 12 loci MIRU-VNTR RDRio signatures revealed that 96.3% (129/134) of MDR and extensively drug resistant (XDR) clusters were RDRio. This is the first report associating the LAM RDRio sublineage with MDR. These results are an important contribution to the monitoring of these strains with heightened transmission for future endeavors to arrest MDR-TB and XDR-TB. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

10.1093_tropej_fmr104	Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis of the Spine in Children-Characteristics from a High Burden Setting	Methods: Hospital and laboratory records at Brooklyn Chest and Tygerberg Children's Hospitals, Cape Town, South Africa, were analysed (January 2004 until December 2010) searching for children treated for MDR spinal TB. Results: Of the 11 children identified, 4 were excluded. Of the 7 remaining, 5 were boys; median age: 8 years, median delay to treatment initiation: 36 weeks. Among them one child died, five have completed treatment and one is near the end of therapy. Medications were well-tolerated and although two of the surviving children have spinal deformity, none have significant neurological deficit. Conclusions: The diagnosis of spinal MDR-TB is often delayed in children, frequently leading to advanced disease and severe vertebral damage. Children tolerate therapy well and, once identified, it is a condition that can be treated successfully.

10.1128_AAC.05385_11	Systematic Analysis of Pyrazinamide-Resistant Spontaneous Mutants and Clinical Isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a first-line antitubercular drug known for its activity against persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli. We set out to systematically determine the PZA susceptibility profiles and mutations in the pyrazinamidase (pncA) gene of a collection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) clinical isolates and PZA-resistant (PZA(r)) spontaneous mutants. The frequency of acquired resistance to PZA was determined to be 10(-5) bacilli in vitro. Selection at a lower concentration of PZA yielded a significantly larger number of spontaneous mutants. The methodical approach employed allowed for determination of the frequency of the PZA(r) phenotype correlated with mutations in the pncA gene, which was 87.5% for the laboratory-selected spontaneous mutants examined in this study. As elucidated by structural analysis, most of the identified mutations were foreseen to affect protein activity through either alteration of an active site residue or destabilization of protein structure, indicating some preferential mutation site rather than random scattering. Twelve percent of the PZA(r) mutants did not have a pncA mutation, strongly indicating the presence of at least one other mechanism(s) of PZA(r).

10.1111_j.1440_1843.2012.02218.x	Poor correlation between tuberculin skin tests and interferon-gamma assays in close contacts of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Background and Objective: The results of tuberculin skin tests (TST) and QuantiFERON TB-Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assays were compared in close contacts of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Methods: Close contacts of patients with bacteriologically confirmed MDR-TB (n = 101) were assessed. Most contacts were members of the households of patients, and 79 (78.2%) had received Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination. Samples from each contact were tested using the TST and the QFT-GIT assay on the same day, and the concordance between these results was assessed using kappa (?) coefficients. Results: Forty-eight subjects (47.5%) showed positive responses on TST, using a 10-mm induration cut-off, and 54 (53.5%) were positive for the QFT-GIT assay. Of the 48 individuals who were TST positive, 34 (70.8%) were positive for the QFT-GIT assay. Of the 53 subjects who were TST negative, 33 (62.5%) were negative for the QFT-GIT assay. The overall agreement between the two tests (? coefficient) was 0.33. The ? coefficient was higher in the 22 subjects who had not received BCG vaccination (? = 0.48) than in the 79 subjects who had received BCG vaccination (? = 0.29). Conclusion: The TST and QFT-GIT assays showed poor correlation in close contacts of patients with MDR-TB, especially those contacts who had received BCG vaccination.	close contact; interferon-? assay; multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis; tuberculin skin test	HEALTH-CARE WORKERS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; INFECTION; RESPONSES; DISCREPANCY; DIAGNOSIS; BURDEN; COHORT
10.1007_s10482_012_9777_0	Exploring anti-TB leads from natural products library originated from marine microbes and medicinal plants	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and TB-HIV co-infection have become a great threat to global health. However, the last truly novel drug that was approved for the treatment of TB was discovered 40 years ago. The search for new effective drugs against TB has never been more intensive. Natural products derived from microbes and medicinal plants have been an important source of TB therapeutics. Recent advances have been made to accelerate the discovery rate of novel TB drugs including diversifying strategies for environmental strains, high-throughput screening (HTS) assays, and chemical diversity. This review will discuss the challenges of finding novel natural products with anti-TB activity from marine microbes and plant medicines, including biodiversity- and taxonomy-guided microbial natural products library construction, target- and cell-based HTS, and bioassay-directed isolation of anti-TB substances from traditional medicines.

10.1371_journal.pone.0045554	Is One Sputum Specimen as Good as Two during Follow-Up Cultures for Monitoring Multi Drug Resistant Tuberculosis Patients in India?	Background: In India, the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) has adopted the strategy of examining two specimens during follow-up culture examinations to monitor the treatment response of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients. Objectives: To determine the incremental yield of the second sputum specimen during follow-up culture examinations among patients with MDR-TB and the effect on case management on changing from two to one specimen follow-up strategy. Methods: A cross sectional record review of MDR-TB patients registered during 2008-09 under RNTCP was undertaken in three MDR-TB treatment sites of India. Results: Of 1721 pairs of follow-up sputum culture examinations done among 220 MDR-TB patients, 451(26%) were positive with either of the two specimens; 29(1.7%) were culture positive only on the second specimen indicating the incremental yield. To detect one additional culture positive result on the second specimen, 59 specimens needed to be processed. If we had examined only one specimen, we would have missed 29 culture-positive results. By current RNTCP guidelines, however, a single specimen policy would have altered case management in only 3(0.2%) instances, where patients would have missed a one month extension of the intensive phase of MDR-TB treatment. There is no meaningful advantage in using two specimens for the monitoring of MDR-TB patients. A single specimen policy could be safely implemented with negligible clinical effect on MDR-TB patients and favourable resource implications for RNTCP.

An in silico ligand-based model based on structure-activity data from 170 BTZ compounds was used to design a new series. Compounds were tested against a panel of mycobacterial strains and were profiled for cytotoxicity, stability, and antiproliferative effects. Several of the compounds showed improved activity against MDR-TB while retaining low toxicity with higher microsomal, metabolic, and plasma stability.

10.1016_j.gene.2012.06.044	Screening and comparison of differentially expressed genes between one MDR-TB strain and the virulent M. tuberculosis H37Rv	To screen and compare the differentially expressed genes between one MDR-TB strain separated from one child patient and the virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) technology was used to build a library of cDNAs that were differentially expressed in the MDR and H37Rv. From this cDNA library, genes that were expressed in the MDR-TB but not in the H37Rv were selected for gene sequencing and homology analysis; 113 positive clones were obtained, their cDNA fragments were sequenced, and homology analysis was performed. Four novel sequences were identified. The results provide a partial list of genes differentially expressed in MDR-TB and four novel genes were found. Identification of these genes may contribute to our understanding of MDR-TB development. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

10.1186_1471_2180_12_191	Drug resistance-conferring mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis from Madang, Papua New Guinea	Background: Monitoring drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is essential to curb the spread of tuberculosis (TB). Unfortunately, drug susceptibility testing is currently not available in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and that impairs TB control in this country. We report for the first time M. tuberculosis mutations associated with resistance to first and second-line anti-TB drugs in Madang, PNG. A molecular cluster analysis was performed to identify M. tuberculosis transmission in that region. Results: Phenotypic drug susceptibility tests showed 15.7% resistance to at least one drug and 5.2% multidrug resistant (MDR) TB. Rifampicin resistant strains had the rpoB mutations D516F, D516Y or S531L; Isoniazid resistant strains had the mutations katG S315T or inhA promoter C15T; Streptomycin resistant strains had the mutations rpsL K43R, K88Q, K88R), rrs A514C or gidB V77G. The molecular cluster analysis indicated evidence for transmission of resistant strain. Conclusions: We observed a substantial rate of MDR-TB in the Madang area of PNG associated with mutations in specific genes. A close monitoring of drug resistance is therefore urgently required, particularly in the presence of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis transmission. In the absence of phenotypic drug susceptibility testing in PNG, molecular assays for drug resistance monitoring would be of advantage.

pub-1127	GENETIC POLYMORPHISMS AMONG MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS ISOLATES FROM PATIENTS WITH PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS IN NORTHERN INDIA	Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) based on IS6110 is considered the gold standard for Mycobacterium tuberculosis molecular typing. It is useful to discriminate among M. tuberculosis strains, investigate outbreaks and distinguish between reactivation and re-infection. We studied polymorphisms among M. tuberculosis isolates from northern India using RFLP to determine the presence of a correlation between IS6110 based fingerprints and drug resistance and to look for relapse and transmission among patients and their contacts. RFLP patterns of PvuII digested genomic DNA of 100 M. tuberculosis isolates were analyzed using southern blotting with a 245 bp IS6110 probe. Drug sensitivity testing (DST) was conducted for rifampicin (40 mu g/ml), isoniazid (1 mu g/ml), ethambutol (2 mu g/ml) and streptomycin (4 mu g/ml) using the proportion method. A high degree of polymorphism was seen among the M. tuberculosis isolates and the number of IS6110 copies varied from 0 to 14, with a predominance of isolates with 11 bands. Seventy-five isolates had a high number of bands, 9 had an intermediate number, 6 isolates had a low number and 10 isolates had no bands. No correlation between IS6110 band numbers and RFLP banding patterns was found with drug resistance or for any particular geographical area, although clustering was seen amongst MDR-TB cases. No cases of relapses or transmissions were seen.

10.1007_s13312_012_0158_6	Clinical profile of drug resistant tuberculosis in children	This Cross-sectional observational study was conducted to determine the clinical profile of drug-resistant tuberculosis in children. Patients were classified as monoresistant TB, polyresistant TB, multidrug resistant (MDR)-TB and extensively drug resistant (XDR - TB). We coined a term called as Partial XDR-TB when isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were confirmed to be resistant in vitro to be MDR along with either a fluoroquinolone or an aminoglycoside resistance (apart from streptomycin). Of 500 children analysed, 34 (6.8%) had drug resistant TB. Mean age of presentation was 6.8 +/- 3.2 years (Male: Female ratio 13:21). 18 (52.9%) children had been treated for tuberculosis in the past (1 defaulted), 7 patients had been in contact with an adult suffering from drug resistant TB and 3 patients (10.3%) were HIV co-infected. Fourteen children (41.2 %) had MDR TB, 11 (32.4 %) had Partial XDR, 1 each (2.9 %) had polyresistant TB and XDR TB. Clinical features of DR-TB are similar in all age groups. Past history of TB with treatment with antitubercular agents, and contact with adults suffering with drug-resistant TB are important risk factors in development of drug-resistant -TB in children.

10.1590_S0074_02762012000600009	A study of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in risk groups in the city of Santos, Sao Paulo, Brazil	Monitoring the extent of and trends in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a priority of the Brazilian National Tuberculosis Control Programme. The current study aimed to estimate the incidence of MDR-TB, describe the profile of TB drug resistance in risk groups and examine whether screening for MDR-TB adhered to the recommended guidelines. A descriptive study that examined diagnosed cases of pulmonary TB was conducted in the city of Santos, Brazil, between 2000-2004. Of the 2,176 pulmonary TB cases studied, 671 (30.8%) met the criteria for drug sensitivity testing and, of these cases, 31.7% (213/671) were tested. Among the tested cases, 9.4% were resistant to one anti-TB drug and 15% were MDR. MDR was observed in 11.6% of 86 new TB cases and 17.3% of 127 previously treated cases. The average annual incidence of MDR-TB was 1.9 per 100,000 inhabitants-years. The extent of known MDR-TB in the city of Santos is high, though likely to be underestimated. Our study therefore indicates an inadequate adherence to the guidelines for MDR-TB screening and suggests the necessity of alternative strategies of MDR-TB surveillance.	pulmonary tuberculosis; drug resistance; multidrug resistance; surveillance	DRUG-RESISTANCE; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; TRANSMISSION
10.1007_s11427_012_4368_x	Immunotherapy using IL-2 and GM-CSF is a potential treatment for multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis	This study investigated the therapeutic effects of interleukin (IL)-2 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) co-administrated with antibacterial agents isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF) to treat a mouse model of tuberculosis (TB) infection. A drug-susceptible TB strain, H37Rv was used to infect mice and the effectiveness of IL-2 and GM-CSF was initially evaluated based on survival rate, bacterial counts in lungs and spleens and the pathological condition of the lungs. Next, the therapeutic effect of the immunotherapy regimen was assessed in multidrug-resistant strain OB35-infected mice. In the H37Rv infection model, IL-2 and GM-CSF monotherapies reduced bacterial numbers in the lungs by 0.82 (P < 0.01) and 0.58 (P < 0.05) lg colony-forming units (CFU), respectively, and in the spleens by 1.42 (P < 0.01) and 1.22 (P < 0.01) lg CFU, respectively, compared with the untreated group. Mice receiving immunotherapy developed fewer lesions in the lungs compared with mice receiving antibacterial therapy alone. In the OB35 infection model, immunotherapy with either cytokine resulted in a significant reduction of bacterial load in the lungs and spleens and less severe lesions in the lungs compared with the untreated or antibacterial therapy treated mice. Notably, mice receiving immunotherapy with both cytokines had a 30% survival rate which was higher than that in other treated groups, and had significantly less CFUs in the lungs and spleens (1.02 and 1.34 lg CFU) compared with antibacterial therapy alone (P < 0.01). This study demonstrated that immunotherapy with both IL-2 and GM-CSF may be useful to treat multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).	tuberculosis; MDR-TB; IL-2; GM-CSF; immunotherapy	COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR; DNA VACCINES; AVIUM COMPLEX; INFECTION; RESPONSES; COMBINATION; MICE; MACROPHAGES
10.1016_j.rppneu.2012.04.001	Impact of diabetes on the presenting features of tuberculosis in hospitalized patients	Introduction: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor for tuberculosis (TB) and may modify its presenting features. The aim of this study was to find out the influence of DM on clinical, radiological and treatment features of TB in hospitalized patients. Material and methods: In a retrospective study we reviewed the records of 123 patients with TB and DM admitted from 2000 to 2008 and compared this group with another one of 123 patients with TB without DM. Results: Although in both groups multilobar lung lesions predominated, there were more cases of isolated lower lung field (LLF) involvement in diabetics than in nondiabetics (10.6% vs 3.3%, p = 0.03). Cavitary lesions were less frequent (63.4% vs 82.1%, p = 0.01) and extra-pulmonary TB manifestations were more frequent (28.5% vs 16.3%, p = 0.02) in diabetics than in nondiabetics. There were no significant differences between groups regarding multidrug resistant - TB (MDR-TB) and adverse effects of anti-tuberculosis drugs. The in-hospital mortality was higher in diabetics (8.1% vs 0.8%, p = 0.01), but using a binary logistic regression there was significant difference in mortality only in respect to the variable MDR-TB. Conclusions: This study showed that DM affected some clinical and radiological presenting features in hospitalized TB patients. LLF involvement and extra-pulmonary TB manifestations were more frequent in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic ones. (C) 2011 Sociedade Portuguesa de Pneumologia. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.

10.1016_j.tube.2012.06.003	Predictors of poor outcomes among patients treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis at DOTS-plus projects	The Objective of this analysis was to identify predictors of death, failure, and default among MDR-TB patients treated with second-line drugs in DOTS-plus projects in Estonia, Latvia, Philippines, Russia, and Peru, 2000-2004. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using multivariable regression. Of 1768 patients, treatment outcomes were: cure/completed - 1156 (65%), died - 200 (11%), default - 241 (14%), failure -118 (7%). Independent predictors of death included: age>45 years (RR = 1.90 (95% CI 1.29-2.80), HIV infection (RR = 4.22 (2.65-6.72)), extrapulmonary disease (RR = 1.54 (1.04-2.26)), BMI<18.5 (RR = 2.71 (1.91-3.85)), previous use of fluoroquinolones (RR = 1.91 (1.31-2.78)), resistance to any thioamide (RR = 1.59 (1.14-2.22)), baseline positive smear (RR = 2.22 (1.60-3.10)), no culture conversion by 3rd month of treatment (RR = 1.69 (1.19-2.41)); failure: cavitary disease (RR = 1.73 (1.07-2.80)), resistance to any fluoroquinolone (RR = 2.73 (1.71-4.37)) and any thioamide (RR = 1.62 (1.12-2.34)), and no culture conversion by 3rd month (RR = 5.84 (3.02-11.27)); default: unemployment (RR = 1.50 (1.12-2.01)), homelessness (RR = 1.52 (1.00-2.31)), imprisonment (RR = 1.86 (1.42-2.45)), alcohol abuse (RR = 1.60 (1.18-2.16)), and baseline positive smear (RR = 1.35 (1.07-1.71)). Patients with biomedical risk factors for treatment failure or death should receive heightened medical attention. To prevent treatment default, management of patients who are unemployed, homeless, alcoholic, or have a prison history requires extra measures to insure treatment completion.

10.5588_ijtld.12.0037	Predictors of recurrence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis	OBJECTIVE: To assess the treatment outcome of the first Green Light Committee (GLC) approved countrywide management of multidrug-resistant (MDR-) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in Estonia and to evaluate risk factors contributing to TB recurrence over 8 years of follow-up. DESIGN: Prospective assessment of MDR- and XDR-TB patients starting second-line anti-tuberculosis drug treatment between 1 August 2001 and 31 July 2003, with follow-up until 31 December 2010. RESULTS: In 211 MDR- and XDR-TB patients, treatment success was 61.1%; 22.3% defaulted, 8.5% failed and 8.1% died. TB recurrence among successfully treated patients was 8.5%, with no significant difference between XDR-TB and MDR-TB. TB recurrence was associated with resistance to all injectables (HR 2.27, 95%CI 1.16-5.06, P = 0.046), resistance to a greater number of drugs (HR 1.35, 95%CI 1.11-1.64, P = 0.003), and sputum smear positivity (HR 2.16, 95%CI 1.16-4.00, P = 0.016). A history of previous TB treatment was associated with TB recurrence among successfully treated patients (HR 4.28, 95%CI 1.13-16.15, P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: The internationally recommended Category IV treatment regimens are sufficiently effective to cure 75% of adherent MDR- and XDR-TB patients. A history of previous treatment, resistance to all injectable agents and resistance to a greater number of drugs increase the recurrence of MDR- and XDR-TB.	treatment outcome; MDR- and XDR-TB recurrence; previously treated MDR- and XDR-TB; sputum smear positivity	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; RELAPSE; COHORT
10.1128_JCM.00358_12	Molecular Characterization and Second-Line Antituberculosis Drug Resistance Patterns of Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates from the Northern Region of South Africa	Despite South Africa being one of the high-burden multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) countries, information regarding the population structure of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains is limited from many regions of South Africa. This study investigated the population structure and transmission patterns of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates in a high-burden setting of South Africa as well as the possible association of genotypes with drug resistance and demographic characteristics. A total of 336 consecutive MDR-TB isolates from four provinces of South Africa were genotyped using spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing. Drug susceptibility testing for ofloxacin, kanamycin, and capreomycin was performed using the agar proportion method. The results showed that 4.8% of MDR-TB isolates were resistant to ofloxacin, 2.7% were resistant to kanamycin, and 4.5% were resistant to capreomycin, while 7.1% were extensively drug resistant (XDR), and the remaining 83.6% were susceptible to all of the second-line drugs tested. Spoligotyping grouped 90.8% of the isolates into 25 clusters, while 9.2% isolates were unclustered. Ninety-one percent of the 336 isolates were assigned to 21 previously described shared types, with the Beijing family being the predominant genotype in the North-West and Limpopo Provinces, while the EAI1_SOM family was the predominant genotype in the Gauteng and Mpumalanga Provinces. No association was found between genotypes and specific drug resistance patterns or demographic information. The high level of diversity and the geographical distribution of the drug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates in this study suggest that the transmission of TB in the study settings is not caused by the clonal spread of a specific M. tuberculosis strain.

10.1128_JCM.00982_12	Genetic Determinants of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis among HIV-Infected Patients in Nigeria	Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common opportunistic infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is a growing problem in resource-limited settings. Adequate infrastructure for testing drug sensitivity and sufficient evidence of first-line resistance are currently unavailable in Nigeria. We collected sputum samples from HIV-infected patients enrolled in the Harvard PEPFAR/APIN Plus program over 12 months at two PEPFAR antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinics in the southwest and north central regions in Nigeria. Smear-positive sputum samples were submitted for GenoType MTBDRplus testing (n = 415); mutations were confirmed through sequencing. Our results show high rates of DR-TB in Nigerian HIV-infected individuals (7.0% for rifampin [RIF] and 9.3% for RIF or isoniazid [INH]). Total RIF resistance indicative of MDR-TB in treatment-naive patients was 5.52%, far exceeding the World Health Organization predictions (0 to 4.3%). RIF resistance was found in 6/213 (2.8%) cases, INH resistance was found in 3/215 (1.4%) cases, and MDR-TB was found in 8/223 (3.6%) cases. We found significantly different amounts of DR-TB by location (18.18% in the south of the country versus 3.91% in the north central region [P < 0.01]). Furthermore, RIF resistance was genetically distinct, suggesting possible location-specific strains are responsible for the transmission of drug resistance (P < 0.04). Finally, GenoType MTBDRplus correctly identified the drug-resistant samples compared to sequencing in 96.8% of cases. We found that total DR-TB in HIV-infection is high and that transmission of drug-resistant TB in HIV-infected patients in Nigeria is higher than predicted.

10.1371_journal.pone.0044245	Activity of Trifluoperazine against Replicating, Non-Replicating and Drug Resistant M-tuberculosis	Trifluoperazine, a knowm calmodulin antagonist, belongs to a class of phenothiazine compounds that have multiple sites of action in mycobacteria including lipid synthesis, DNA processes, protein synthesis and respiration. The objective of this study is to evaluate the potential of TFP to be used as a lead molecule for development of novel TB drugs by showing its efficacy on multiple drug resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) and non-replicating dormant M.tb. Wild type and MDR M.tb were treated with TFP under different growth conditions of stress like low pH, starvation, presence of nitric oxide and in THP-1 infection model. Perturbation in growth kinetics of bacilli at different concentrations of TFP was checked to determine the MIC of TFP for active as well as dormant bacilli. Results show that TFP is able to significantly reduce the actively replicating as well as non-replicating bacillary load. It has also shown inhibitory effect on the growth of MDR M.tb. TFP has shown enhanced activity against intracellular bacilli, presumably because phenothiazines are known to get accumulated in macrophages. This concentration was, otherwise, found to be non-toxic to macrophage in vitro. Our results show that TFP has the potential to be an effective killer of both actively growing and non-replicating bacilli including MDR TB. Further evaluation and in vivo studies with Trifluoperazine can finally help us know the feasibility of this compound to be used as either a lead compound for development of new TB drugs or as an adjunct in the current TB chemotherapy.

10.5897_AJMR12.888	Genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex based on restriction enzyme analysis of the hsp65 gene	Several genotypes of Mycobacterium with varied degree of virulence and drug resistance exist globally. Grouping of the genotypes into principal genetic groups is critical for tuberculosis (TB) control. This study determined the suitability of polymerase chain reaction-restriction enzyme analysis (PCR-REA) technique as an epidemiological typing tool and a technique for drug resistance surveillance of TB. Seventy-five Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from National TB Reference Laboratory, Nigeria Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) Yaba, Lagos, Nigeria were identified and their susceptibility to isoniazid and rifampicin determined using Genotype MTBDRplus technique. Isolates were further confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primer specific to 65 kDa heat shock protein (hsp65) of Mycobacterium species, Fingerprinting was done by restriction enzyme (Bst Ell) analysis. Of the 75 isolates studied, 5(6.7%) were multi- drug resistant (MDR)- TB, 11(14.7%) and 7(9.3%) were mono-resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid respectively. PCR-REA profile revealed 3 different patterns. Majority (96.2%) of the susceptible strains and 100% each of mono-resistant and MDR -TB yielded 2 fragments of 250 and 120 bp. Our findings demonstrated that hsp65 kDa based molecular genotyping technique is a rapid, simple and easy-to-interpret method and may be used as a predictor of M. tuberculosis genetic variation.

10.1371_journal.pone.0042323	Increased Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing Genotype Strains Associated with Resistance to Streptomycin: A Population-Based Study	Background: Studies have shown that the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing genotype is an emerging pathogen that is frequently associated with drug resistance. This suggests that drug resistant Beijing strains have a relatively high transmission fitness compared to other drug-resistant strains. Methods and Findings: We studied the relative transmission fitness of the Beijing genotype in relation to anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in a population-based study of smear-positive tuberculosis patients prospectively recruited and studied over a 4-year period in rural Vietnam. Transmission fitness was analyzed by clustering of cases on basis of three DNA typing methods. Of 2531 included patients, 2207 (87%) were eligible for analysis of whom 936 (42%) were in a DNA fingerprint cluster. The clustering rate varied by genotype with 292/786 (37%) for the Beijing genotype, 527/802 (67%) for the East-African Indian (EAI) genotype, and 117/619 (19%) for other genotypes. Clustering was associated with the EAI compared to the Beijing genotype (adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) 3.4: 95% CI 2.8-4.4). Patients infected with streptomycin-resistant strains were less frequently clustered than patients infected with streptomycin-susceptible strains when these were of the EAI genotype (ORadj 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9), while this pattern was reversed for strains of the Beijing genotype (ORadj 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.8, p for difference 0.002). The strong association between Beijing and MDR-TB (ORadj 7.2; 95% CI 4.2-12.3) existed only if streptomycin resistance was present. Conclusions: Beijing genotype strains showed less overall transmissibility than EAI strains, but when comparisons were made within genotypes, Beijing strains showed increased transmission fitness when streptomycin-resistant, while the reverse was observed for EAI strains. The association between MDR-TB and Beijing genotype in this population was strongly dependent on resistance to streptomycin. Streptomycin resistance may provide Beijing strains with a fitness advantage over other genotypes and predispose to multidrug resistance in patients infected with Beijing strains.

10.1586_ERI.12.73	Why and how thioridazine in combination with antibiotics to which the infective strain is resistant will cure totally drug-resistant tuberculosis	Over a period of 14 years, the authors have studied thioridazine, an old neuroleptic, that has been shown to have in vitro activity against intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis, regardless of its antibiotic resistance status, thioridazine cures infected mice of antibiotic-susceptible and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) infections and, when used in combination with antibiotics used for therapy of TB, renders the organism significantly more susceptible. This article will describe the authors' further work and the mechanisms by which thioridazine alone and in combination with antibiotics cures an extensively drug-resistant infection and why it is expected to cure totally drug-resistant TB infections as well. The concepts presented are entirely new and because they focus on the activation of killing by nonkilling macrophages where M. tuberculosis normally resides during infection, and coupled to the inhibition of efflux pumps which contribute to the antibiotic-resistant status, effective therapy of any antibiotic-resistant TB infection is possible.	efflux pumps; inhibition; killing; MDR TB; TDR TB; TDR TB cures; thioridazine; XDR TB	BACTERIAL EFFLUX PUMPS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; XDR-TB; NEW-YORK; THERAPY; PHENOTHIAZINES; CHLORPROMAZINE; MACROPHAGES; INHIBITION
10.5588_ijtld.11.0713	Integrated, home-based treatment for MDR-TB and HIV in rural South Africa: an alternate model of care	SETTING: Treatment outcomes for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in South Africa have suffered as centralized, in-patient treatment programs struggle to cope with rising prevalence and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection rates. A new treatment model is needed to expand treatment capacity and improve MDR-TB and HIV outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To describe the design and preliminary results of an integrated, home-based MDR-TB-HIV treatment program created in rural KwaZulu-Natal. METHOD: In 2008, a decentralized center was established to provide out-patient MDR-TB and HIV treatment. Nurses, community health workers and family supporters have been trained to administer injections, provide adherence support and monitor adverse reactions in patients' homes. Physicians assess clinical response, adherence and the severity of adverse reactions to MDR-TB and HIV treatment at monthly follow-up visits. Treatment outcomes are assessed by monthly cultures and CD4 and viral load every 6 months. RESULTS: Of 80 patients initiating MDR-TB treatment from February 2008 to April 2010, 66 were HIV-co-infected. Retention has been high (only 5% defaults, 93% of visits attended), and preliminary outcomes have been favorable (77% cured/still on treatment, 82% undetectable viral load). Few patients have required escalation of care (9%), had severe adverse events (8%) or died (6%). CONCLUSION: Integrated, home-based treatment for MDR-TB and HIV is a promising treatment model to expand capacity and achieve improved outcomes in rural, resource-poor and high HIV prevalent settings.

10.5588_ijtld.11.0696	Outcomes and follow-up of patients treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Orel, Russia, 2002-2005	SETTING: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment facility, Orel Oblast, Russian Federation. OBJECTIVES: To determine factors associated with poor outcome and to document status of patients after recording of TB outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective review of prospective single cohort. RESULTS: Among 192 patients, factors significantly associated with poor outcome in multivariate analysis include three or more treatment interruptions during the intensive phase of therapy and alcohol or drug addiction (adjusted OR [aOR] 2.1, 95%CI 1.0-4.3 and aOR 1.9, 95%CI 1.0-3.7). Previous treatment was associated with poor outcome, but only among smear-positive patients (aOR 3.1, 95%CI 1.3-7.3). Ten patients (5%) developed extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) during treatment; of 115 patients with at least 6 months of follow-up data after outcomes were recorded, 13 (11%) developed XDR-TB. CONCLUSION: Interventions focused on supporting patient adherence during the intensive phase of treatment; the management of drug and alcohol addiction should be developed and studied. A substantial proportion of patients developed XDR-TB during and after treatment. Longer term follow-up data of patients treated for MDR-TB are needed to better inform programmatic policy.	recurrence; default; alcohol	MDR-TB; XDR-TB; RETROSPECTIVE COHORT; RISK-FACTORS; RECURRENCE; ALCOHOL; IMPLEMENTATION; METAANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT; DEFAULT
10.1371_journal.pmed.1001300	Multidrug Resistant Pulmonary Tuberculosis Treatment Regimens and Patient Outcomes: An Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis of 9,153 Patients	Background: Treatment of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is lengthy, toxic, expensive, and has generally poor outcomes. We undertook an individual patient data meta-analysis to assess the impact on outcomes of the type, number, and duration of drugs used to treat MDR-TB. Methods and Findings: Three recent systematic reviews were used to identify studies reporting treatment outcomes of microbiologically confirmed MDR-TB. Study authors were contacted to solicit individual patient data including clinical characteristics, treatment given, and outcomes. Random effects multivariable logistic meta-regression was used to estimate adjusted odds of treatment success. Adequate treatment and outcome data were provided for 9,153 patients with MDR-TB from 32 observational studies. Treatment success, compared to failure/relapse, was associated with use of: later generation quinolones, (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.5 [95% CI 1.1-6.0]), ofloxacin (aOR: 2.5 [1.6-3.9]), ethionamide or prothionamide (aOR: 1.7 [1.3-2.3]), use of four or more likely effective drugs in the initial intensive phase (aOR: 2.3 [1.3-3.9]), and three or more likely effective drugs in the continuation phase (aOR: 2.7 [1.7-4.1]). Similar results were seen for the association of treatment success compared to failure/relapse or death: later generation quinolones, (aOR: 2.7 [1.7-4.3]), ofloxacin (aOR: 2.3 [1.3-3.8]), ethionamide or prothionamide (aOR: 1.7 [1.4-2.1]), use of four or more likely effective drugs in the initial intensive phase (aOR: 2.7 [1.9-3.9]), and three or more likely effective drugs in the continuation phase (aOR: 4.5 [3.4-6.0]). Conclusions: In this individual patient data meta-analysis of observational data, improved MDR-TB treatment success and survival were associated with use of certain fluoroquinolones, ethionamide, or prothionamide, and greater total number of effective drugs. However, randomized trials are urgently needed to optimize MDR-TB treatment.

10.1371_journal.pone.0040774	Evaluation of the Burden of Unsuspected Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Co-Morbidity with Non-Communicable Diseases in Sputum Producing Adult Inpatients	Background: A high burden of tuberculosis (TB) occurs in sub-Saharan African countries and many cases of active TB and drug-resistant TB remain undiagnosed. Tertiary care hospitals provide an opportunity to study TB co-morbidity with non-communicable and other communicable diseases (NCDs/CDs). We evaluated the burden of undiagnosed pulmonary TB and multi-drug resistant TB in adult inpatients, regardless of their primary admission diagnosis, in a tertiary referral centre. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this prospective study, newly admitted adult inpatients able to produce sputum at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia, were screened for pulmonary TB using fluorescent smear microscopy and automated liquid culture. The burden of pulmonary TB, unsuspected TB, TB co-morbidity with NCDs and CDs was determined. Sputum was analysed from 900 inpatients (70.6% HIV infected) 277 (30.8%) non-TB suspects, 286 (31.8%) TB suspects and 337 (37.4%) were already receiving TB treatment. 202/900 (22.4%) of patients had culture confirmed TB. TB co-morbidity was detected in 20/275 (7.3%) NCD patients, significantly associated with diabetes (P = 0.006, OR 6.571, 95% CI: 1.706-25.3). 27/202 (13.4%) TB cases were unsuspected. There were 18 confirmed cases of MDR-TB, 5 of which were unsuspected. Conclusions/Significance: A large burden of unsuspected pulmonary TB co-morbidity exists in inpatients with NCDs and other CDs. Pro-active sputum screening of all inpatients in tertiary referral centres in high TB endemic countries is recommended. The scale of the problem of undiagnosed MDR-TB in inpatients requires further study.		SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS; SUBCLINICAL TUBERCULOSIS; TB; COUNTRIES; CULTURE
10.1371_journal.pone.0041318	Mycobacterium tuberculosis Population in Northwestern Russia: An Update from Russian-EU/Latvian Border Region	This study aimed to characterize the population structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Pskov oblast in northwestern Russia, to view it in the geographical context, to compare drug resistance properties across major genetic families. Ninety M. tuberculosis strains from tuberculosis (TB) patients, permanent residents in Pskov oblast were subjected to LAM-specific IS6110-PCR and spoligotyping, followed by comparison with SITVITWEB and MIRU-VNTRplus databases. The Beijing genotype (n = 40) was found the most prevalent followed by LAM (n = 18), T (n = 13), Haarlem (n = 10), Ural (n = 5), and Manu2 (n = 1); the family status remained unknown for 3 isolates. The high rate of Beijing genotype and prevalence of LAM family are similar to those in the other Russian settings. A feature specific for M. tuberculosis population in Pskov is a relatively higher rate of Haarlem and T types. Beijing strains were further typed with 12-MIRU (followed by comparison with proprietary global database) and 3 hypervariable loci QUB-3232, VNTR-3820, VNTR-4120. The 12-MIRU typing differentiated 40 Beijing strains into 14 types (HGI = 0.82) while two largest types were M2 (223325153533) prevalent throughout former USSR and M11 (223325173533) prevalent in Russia and East Asia. The use of 3 hypervariable loci increased a discrimination of the Beijing strains (18 profiles, HGI = 0.89). Both major families Beijing and LAM had similar rate of MDR strains (62.5 and 55.6%, respectively) that was significantly higher than in other strains (21.9%; P = 0.001 and 0.03, respectively). The rpoB531 mutations were more frequently found in Beijing strains while LAM drug resistant strains mainly harbored rpoB516 and inhA -15 mutations. Taken together with a high rate of multidrug resistance among Beijing strains from new TB cases (79.3% versus 44.4% in LAM), these findings suggest the critical impact of the Beijing genotype on the current situation with MDR-TB in the Pskov region in northwestern Russia.

10.1371_journal.pone.0040781	Adverse Events among HIV/MDR-TB Co-Infected Patients Receiving Antiretroviral and Second Line Anti-TB Treatment in Mumbai, India	Background: Significant adverse events (AE) have been reported in patients receiving medications for multidrug- and extensively-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB & XDR-TB). However, there is little prospective data on AE in MDR- or XDR-TB/HIV co-infected patients on antituberculosis and antiretroviral therapy (ART) in programmatic settings. Methods: Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) is supporting a community-based treatment program for drug-resistant tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients in a slum setting in Mumbai, India since 2007. Patients are being treated for both diseases and the management of AE is done on an outpatient basis whenever possible. Prospective data were analysed to determine the occurrence and nature of AE. Results: Between May 2007 and September 2011, 67 HIV/MDR-TB co-infected patients were being treated with anti-TB treatment and ART; 43.3% were female, median age was 35.5 years (Interquartile Range: 30.5-42) and the median duration of anti-TB treatment was 10 months (range 0.5-30). Overall, AE were common in this cohort: 71%, 63% and 40% of patients experienced one or more mild, moderate or severe AE, respectively. However, they were rarely life-threatening or debilitating. AE occurring most frequently included gastrointestinal symptoms (45% of patients), peripheral neuropathy (38%), hypothyroidism (32%), psychiatric symptoms (29%) and hypokalaemia (23%). Eleven patients were hospitalized for AE and one or more suspect drugs had to be permanently discontinued in 27 (40%). No AE led to indefinite suspension of an entire MDR-TB or ART regimen. Conclusions: AE occurred frequently in this Mumbai HIV/MDR-TB cohort but not more frequently than in non-HIV patients on similar anti-TB treatment. Most AE can be successfully managed on an outpatient basis through a community-based treatment program, even in a resource-limited setting. Concerns about severe AE in the management of co-infected patients are justified, however, they should not cause delays in the urgently needed rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy and second-line anti-TB treatment.

10.1371_journal.pone.0040456	Use of Multiplex Allele-Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (MAS-PCR) to Detect Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Panama	The frequency of individual genetic mutations conferring drug resistance (DR) to Mycobacterium tuberculosis has not been studied previously in Central America, the place of origin of many immigrants to the United States. The current gold standard for detecting multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST), which is resource-intensive and slow, leading to increased MDR-TB transmission in the community. We evaluated multiplex allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (MAS-PCR) as a rapid molecular tool to detect MDR-TB in Panama. Based on DST, 67 MDR-TB and 31 drug-sensitive clinical isolates were identified and cultured from an archived collection. Primers were designed to target five mutation hotspots that confer resistance to the first-line drugs isoniazid and rifampin, and MAS-PCR was performed. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed DR mutations identified by MAS-PCR, and provided frequencies of genetic mutations. DNA sequencing revealed 70.1% of MDR strains to have point mutations at codon 315 of the katG gene, 19.4% within mabA-inhA promoter, and 98.5% at three hotspots within rpoB. MAS-PCR detected each of these mutations, yielding 82.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity for isoniazid resistance, and 98.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity for rifampin resistance relative to DST. The frequency of individual DR mutations among MDR strains in Panama parallels that of other TB-endemic countries. The performance of MAS-PCR suggests that it may be a relatively inexpensive and technically feasible method for rapid detection of MDR-TB in developing countries.

10.4103_0022_3859.101379	Trends of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance pattern in new cases and previously treated cases of extrapulmonary tuberculosis cases in referral hospitals in northern India	Background: Drug-resistant tuberculosis is one of major current challenges to global public health. The transmission of resistant strains is increasing as a burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients in extra pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) cases in India. Aim and Objectives: The aim was to study trends of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance pattern in new cases and previously treated cases of EPTB in referral hospitals in northern India. Study Design and Setting: A prospectively observational study and referral medical institutions in northern India. Materials and Methods: All EPTB specimens were processed for Ziehl Neelsen staining, BACTEC culture and BACTEC NAP test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. All M. tuberculosis complex isolates were performed for radiometric-based drug susceptibility pattern against streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol using the 1% proportion method. Results: We found that 165/756 (20.5%) isolates were identified as M. tuberculosis complex by the NAP test. We observed that 39.9% were resistant to first-line antitubercular drugs. The resistance rate was higher in previously treated patients: H (30.3%), R (16.3%), E (15.7%) and S (16.3%). MDR-TB was observed in 13.4%, but, in new cases, this was 11.4% and 19.1% of the previously treated patients (P<0.05). Conclusion: MDR-TB is gradually increased in EPTB cases and predominant resistance to previous treated cases of EPTB. The molecular drug sensitivity test (DST) method can be an early decision for chemotherapy in MDR-TB patients. The International Standards of TB Care need to be used by the RNTCP and professional medical associations as a tool to improve TB care in the country.

10.1177_1010539511408067	Treatment Outcome of Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Nepal	The purpose of this study was to examine factors associated with treatment outcome of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases in Nepal. A retrospective analysis of MDR-TB cases by demographic determinants and treatment was conducted. A total of 494 MDR-TB cases were registered from 2005 to 2008, with data obtained from the National Tuberculosis Center. Chi-squared tests were used to assess statistically the association between smear and culture conversion and treatment outcome. Determinants were analyzed with the use of Kaplan Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models to generate estimates of the associations with the time to treatment outcome. Sputum conversion status and culture conversion status were positively associated with treatment outcome for MDR-TB. In a multiple Cox proportional hazards regression model, no determinants were found to be associated with time to cure.	multidrug-resistant TB; MDR-TB; treatment outcome; sputum smear conversion; culture conversion; Kaplan-Meier curves; Cox proportional hazards; Nepal	
10.1183_09031936.00169411	Cost and cost-effectiveness of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment in Estonia and Russia	Evidence on the cost and cost-effectiveness of treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is limited, and no published data are available from former Soviet Union countries, where rates of MDR-TB are highest globally. We evaluated the cost and cost-effectiveness of MDR-TB treatment in Estonia and Russia (Tomsk Oblast), comparing cohorts enrolled on treatment according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines in 2001 and 2002 with cohorts treated in previous years. Costs were assessed from a health system perspective in 2003 US$; effects were measured as cures, deaths averted and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted. Cure rates when WHO guidelines were followed were 61% (90 out of 149) in Estonia and 76% (76 out of 100) in Tomsk Oblast, with a cost per patient treated of US$ 8,974 and US$ 10,088, respectively. Before WHO guidelines were followed, cure rates were 52% in Estonia and 15% in Tomsk Oblast; the cost per patient treated was US$ 4,729 and US$ 2,282, respectively. Drugs and hospitalisation accounted for 69-90% of total costs. The cost per DALY averted by treatment following WHO guidelines was US$ 579 (range US$ 297-US$ 902) in Estonia and US$ 429 (range US$ 302-US$ 546) in Tomsk Oblast. Treatment of patients with MDR-TB can be cost-effective, but requires substantial additional investment in tuberculosis control in priority countries.

10.1183_09031936.00204611	Tuberculosis: cost of illness in Germany	4,444 new cases of tuberculosis (TB) were reported in Germany in 2009; of those, the proportion of multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB cases increased to 2.1% (63 cases). On the basis of the therapy guidelines of the German Central Committee against Tuberculosis and the new World Health Organization guidelines, this study estimates the mean direct outpatient and combined in- and outpatient costs of TB, together with other attributable costs of the disease on the basis of the most recent German official health statistics and scientific literature. According to this, the mean outpatient costs (rounded) per case were (sic)1,197 (adults) and (sic)1,006 (children) for standard therapy, but (sic)36,543 for treatment of MDR-TB. The mean combined in-patient/outpatient costs were (sic)7,364 (adults) and (sic)7,300 (children), respectively; the combined costs for treatment of MDR-TB amounted to (sic)52,259. Including MDR-TB cases the mean costs of treatment per TB case were (sic)7,931. These are joined by the mean costs due to loss of productivity ((sic)2,313), costs per case for rehabilitation ((sic)74) and contact tracing ((sic)922), adding up to (sic)11,240. When considering the probability of increasing numbers of MDR-TB cases in the near future, TB is still a disease of significant economic impact in Germany.

10.1099_jmm.0.042655_0	Risk factors associated with kanamycin-resistant tuberculosis in a Beijing tuberculosis referral hospital	The rapidly increasing number of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases worldwide underlines the necessity for the rational use of key second-line drugs such as kanamycin. In this study, we determined the prevalence of, and risk factors associated with, kanamycin-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in 309 Hospital, Beijing, China, with the aim of providing information for better case management in order to minimize further development of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). Drug susceptibility testing results and clinical data were retrospectively analysed for hospitalized TB patients for whom such data were available in 309 Hospital for the period 1997-2009. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the risk factors associated with kanamycin-resistant TB. During 1997-2009, 553 (14.4%) of 3843 tested Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from hospitalized TB patients were kanamycin-resistant. The increasing trend of resistance to kanamycin was reversed since 2000. The independent risk factors associated with kanamycin-resistant TB included living in urban areas [adjusted odds ratio (OR)=1.89], being retreated for repeat cases (adjusted OR=1.60), being smear-positive for acid-fast bacilli at admission to the hospital (adjusted OR=1.39), having ofloxacin-resistant (adjusted OR=1.61) or para-aminosalicylic acid-resistant TB (adjusted OR=1.47), having MDR-TB (adjusted OR=5.10), having MDR-TB plus ofloxacin resistance (adjusted OR=4.27) and having poly-resistant TB (adjusted OR=3.94). The remaining rate of kanamycin resistance is still high despite the reversal of the increasing trend during the past decade. Surveillance of kanamycin resistance, especially among high-risk populations, should be continued to closely monitor trends so that appropriate action can be taken.

10.2217_IMT.12.59	Adjunct immune therapy of first-diagnosed TB, relapsed TB, treatment-failed TB, multidrug-resistant TB and TB/HIV	Aim: To evaluate the effect of an adjunct immunotherapy in randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIb trial involving 123 TB patients. Methods: Patients were randomly allocated into two arms: one (n = 62) received a once-daily pill of V-5 Immunitor (TM) (V5) and the other (control; n = 61) received placebo for 30 days in addition to first- or second-line TB drugs administered under directly observed therapy. The subjects in V5 and placebo arms had first-diagnosed, relapsed, treatment-failed and multidrug-resistant TB at ratios of 17:21:11:13 and 20:19:14:8, respectively; among them, ten and seven had HIV coinfection, respectively. Results: After 1 month, 55 out of 62 patients (88.7%) became sputum smear-negative in the V5 arm (p < 0.0001), whereas in the placebo group, nine out of 61 (14.8%) had converted. The conversion rate among V5 recipients was similar, regardless of whether TB was drug-sensitive, drug-resistant or with HIV. V5 downregulated TB-associated inflammation, as shown by the normalization of elevated leukocyte counts (8.7 vs 6.3 x 10(9)/l; p < 0.0001) and decreased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (22.8 vs 12.6 mm/h; p < 0.0001), whereas among placebo recipients, changes were smaller (8.9 vs 8.2 x 10(9)/l and 25.1 vs 19.9 mm/h). Thirty three (54.1%) placebo patients gained on average 0.8 kg (p = 0.0002); by contrast, 57 (91.9%) out of 62 patients in the V5 group gained a mean weight of 2.9 kg (p < 0.0001). No adverse side effects or reactivation of TB were seen at any time. Conclusion: V5 is safe and effective as an immune adjunct to chemotherapy for TB and can potentially reduce the treatment duration down to 1 month.	immunotherapy; MDR-TB; TB; TB/HIV; vaccine	OPEN-LABEL TRIAL; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIUM-VACCAE; VACCINE; IMMUNOTHERAPY; HEPATITIS; BCG
10.2217_FMB.12.56	Discovery and development of SQ109: a new antitubercular drug with a novel mechanism of action	Existing drugs have limited efficacy against the rising threat of drug-resistant TB, have significant side effects, and must be given in combinations of four to six drugs for at least 6 months for drug-sensitive TB and up to 24 months for drug-resistant TB. The long treatment duration has led to increased patient noncompliance with therapy. This, in turn, drives the development of additional drug resistance In a spiral that has resulted in some forms of TB being currently untreatable by existing drugs. New antitubercular drugs in development, particularly those with mechanisms of action that are different from existing first- and second-line TB drugs, are anticipated to be effective against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB. SQ109 is a new TB drug candidate with a novel mechanism of action that was safe and well tolerated in Phase I and early Phase II clinical trials. We describe herein the identification, development and characterization of SQ109 as a promising new antitubercular drug.	antitubercular agent; clinical trial; drug discovery; drug resistance; MDR-TB; pharmacology; tuberculosis; XDR-TB	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; EARLY BACTERICIDAL ACTIVITY; COMBINATORIAL LEAD OPTIMIZATION; DIRECTLY OBSERVED THERAPY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; IN-VITRO; DIARYLQUINOLINE TMC207; MURINE TUBERCULOSIS; ETHAMBUTOL ANALOGS
10.1093_ejcts_ezs215	Surgical treatment to increase the success rate of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects more than one-third of the world's population and causes an estimated 2-3 million deaths annually. The medical treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) can cure 50-75% of cases. The median prevalence of new MDR-TB cases is 1.1%, while that of previously treated cases is 7%. We carried out a retrospective study on 45 patients with MDR-TB who underwent surgical resection at the Leon Daniello Hospital (Regional Surgery Department) between January 1995 and December 2005. The number of MDR-TB cases has continued to increase despite the implementation of MDR-TB treatment strategies. Drug susceptibility tests showed that all our patients were resistant to at least isoniazid (hydrazide) and rifampicin. Therefore, individual drug regimens including at least five antibiotics were prescribed. Surgery under general anaesthesia (double-lumen endotracheal intubation) was performed by a team of thoracic surgeons. The patients had received anti-tuberculosis (TB) treatment for at least 1 month preoperatively as well as postoperatively. We collected and analysed patients' demographic data, clinical characteristics, place of origin, radiological findings, smear and culture status before surgery, TB localization, primary or secondary drug resistance, surgical procedures, complications, bacteriological smear and culture status after surgical treatment. The indications for surgery include medical treatment failure in 39 patients, persistent cavitary lesions with possible relapses in 3 patients and massive haemoptysis in 3 patients. Lobectomy was carried out in 30 cases, segmentectomy in four cases and cavernoplasty (speleoplasty) in 11 cases. Four weeks postoperatively, there were 83% smear-negative and 17% smear-positive patients. Only minor complications were registered: three patients had wound infections, two had minor haemorrhages and one presented a minor pneumothorax. Operative mortality was zero. The absolute indications for the surgical treatment of MDR-TB include failure of medical therapy (due to persistent cavitary disease and lung or lobar destruction) and massive haemoptysis. Proper patient selection and the timing of operations are crucial to avoid relapses and to provide a definitive cure. Good cooperation between chest physicians and thoracic surgeons as well as patients' adherence to pre- and post-chemotherapy can increase the success rate of MDR-TB treatment.

These compounds upon 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with nitrile oxides furnished two enantiomerically pure 1,2,4-oxadiazoles in moderate yields, which were screened for in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (MTB) and multi-drug resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Among the compounds screened, compound 10h was found to be the most active in vitro with a MIC value of 0.07 and 0.14 mu M against MTB and MDR-TB respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

10.5588_ijtld.11.0795	Alcohol use and the management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Tomsk, Russian Federation	SETTING: Alcohol use increases the risk of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and poses challenges for successful MDR-TB treatment, including the potential for additional adverse events. AIM: To investigate the association between alcohol consumption during MDR-TB treatment and adverse events and treatment outcomes in a cohort of patients in Tomsk, Russia DESIGN: From 2000 to 2004, retrospective data were collected on 407 MDR-TB patients in Tomsk. Factors associated with treatment outcomes were assessed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 407 patients, 253 (62.2%) consumed alcohol during treatment ('drinkers'), and 367 (90.2%) had at least one documented adverse advent. No significant differences were noted in frequency of adverse events in drinkers vs. non-drinkers. Drinkers had less favourable treatment outcomes (OR 0.28, 95%CI 0.18-0.45). Among drinkers, favourable treatment outcome was associated with adherence to at least 80% of prescribed doses (OR 2.89, 95%CI 1.30-6.43) and the occurrence of an adverse event requiring treatment interruption (OR 2.49, 95%CI 1.11-5.59). CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol use did not appear to increase the risk of adverse events during MDR-TB treatment; however, alcohol consumption was associated with poor outcome. Our findings suggest that individuals who drink alcohol should receive aggressive attention to optimise treatment adherence and manage adverse events.	adverse effects; alcohol; outcomes; tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; Russia	USE DISORDERS IDENTIFICATION; RISK-FACTORS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; ADVERSE-REACTIONS; TREATMENT DEFAULT; PULMONARY TB; MDR-TB; NONADHERENCE; DEATH; EPIDEMIOLOGY
10.5588_ijtld.11.0679	The evolving epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis among children in Cape Town, South Africa	SETTING: Tygerberg Children's Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and trend of drug resistance and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection among children with culture-confirmed tuberculosis (TB). METHOD: Prospective surveillance from March 2007 to February 2009, compared to three previous surveys (1994-1998, 2003-2005, 2005-2007). Drug susceptibility testing (DST) against isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP) was performed using genotypic and phenotypic testing. If multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was detected, further DST against ethambutol (EMB) and second-line drugs was performed. RESULTS: A total of 294 children with a median age of 26 months (range 3 days-13 years) were diagnosed with culture-confirmed TB. DST results were available for 292 (99.3%); 41 (14%) were INH-resistant, including 26 (8.9%) with MDR-TB. Four children (1.4%) had RMP monoresistance. EMB resistance was present in 12/24 (50%) MDR-TB cases tested. Two isolates were resistant to ofloxacin; none had extensively drug-resistant TB. Of those tested, 29% (63/217) were HIV-infected. Any resistance to RMP increased between 1994 and 2009 (P < 0.001), as did RMP monoresistance (P = 0.009) and MDR-TB (P < 0.001). Sensitivity was 87.5% and specificity 100% for genotypic compared to phenotypic testing for INH resistance. CONCLUSIONS: RMP, and consequently multidrug, resistance is increasing among children with TB in this setting. EMB resistance is common among children with resistance to RMP and INH.	paediatric; DST; resistant; surveillance; TB	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PROVINCE; DISEASE; SURVEILLANCE; PYRAZINAMIDE; MANAGEMENT; INFECTION; CONTACTS
10.5588_ijtld.11.0547	Microscopic observation drug susceptibility assay in the diagnosis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	BACKGROUND: Early detection of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is of primary importance for both patient management and infection control. Optimal methods for identifying MDR-TB in a timely and affordable manner in resource-limited settings are not yet available. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of a low-technology but rapid drug susceptibility testing method, the microscopic observation drug susceptibility assay (MODS), in the concurrent detection of M. tuberculosis and its susceptibility to isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RMP) directly from sputum specimens. METHODS: A total of 115 smear-positive TB patients admitted to Abbasia Chest Hospital, Cairo, Egypt, were simultaneously tested using MODS and the BACTEC (TM) MGIT (TM) 960 mycobacterial detection system for the detection of M. tuberculosis and the identification of MDR-TB samples. RESULTS: MODS detected 112 (97.4%) samples and BACTEC MGIT detected 115 (100%). Of the 115 isolates tested for susceptibility to INH, RMP and MDR-TB, complete agreement between MODS and MGIT results was found among respectively 92.9%, 95.5% and 97.3% of samples. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of MODS in the detection of MDR-TB were respectively 95.3%, 98.6%, 97.6% and 97.1%. MODS results were obtained in a median of 8 days (range 5-21). CONCLUSION: MODS is an optimal alternative method for timely and affordable identification of MDR-TB in resource-limited settings.

10.5588_ijtld.11.0411	A centralised electronic Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Advisory Service: the first 2 years	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB, defined as resistance to at least both rifampicin and isoniazid) has become a serious problem in the United Kingdom. As it is uncommon, no one clinician has sufficient experience of it to be confident in providing the best management for the patient. The model of a centralised system of management, such as is used in the Baltic countries, would seem a suitable method to adapt to the United Kingdom. With the agreement of the relevant professional organisations, a virtual electronic expert panel, the UK Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Service, has been developed. This body gives advice via a secure website on MDR-TB patients referred by e-mail by clinicians across the country managing MDR-TB cases. In the first 2 years of operation, advice was sought on 60 patients with culture-proven MDR-TB (54% of the UK total). The number of clinicians accessing the advisory service increased from 27 in 2008 to 33 in 2009. Patients of non-UK origin accounted for 90% of all cases, including all four extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis cases. A central electronic virtual committee providing advice via a secure website has proved to be practical, economical and efficient. It could provide a model for MDR-TB management in other countries and for the management of other uncommon diseases.	tuberculosis; multidrug resistance; electronic; website	
10.5588_ijtld.11.0574	Frequency of adverse reactions to first- and second-line anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy in a Korean cohort	OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of and risk factors for major adverse drug reactions (MADRs) associated with anti-tuberculosis treatment at a tuberculosis (TB) referral hospital in the Republic of Korea. METHODS: Data from an ongoing natural history cohort study were analyzed for permanent regimen changes due to adverse drug reactions and confirmed by chart review. RESULTS: Among 655 subjects, there were 132 MADRs in 112 (17%) subjects. The most common MADRs were gastrointestinal (n = 53), musculoskeletal (n = 22), psychiatric (n = 10), visual (n = 9) and peripheral neuropathic (n = 8). MADRs were more frequent in subjects being treated with second-line regimens (16%) compared to first-line regimens (2.5%). Drugs frequently associated with MADRs were amikacin (3/10, 30%), linezolid (8/29, 28%), para-aminosalicylic acid (47/192, 24%), pyrazinamide (31/528, 5.8%), macrolides (2/44, 4.5%) and cycloserine (12/272, 4.4%). Fluoroquinolones accounted for a single MADR (1/377, 0.003%), despite widespread usage. In multivariate analysis, infection with multi- or extensively drug-resistant disease and previous history of anti-tuberculosis treatment were risk factors for MADR, with adjusted hazard ratios of respectively 2.2 (P = 0.02) and 1.6 (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: MADRs are common during anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy in this population, occurring in more than one in six subjects. New and less toxic agents to treat drug-resistant TB are urgently needed.	drug-resistant tuberculosis; drug toxicity; linezolid	DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; INTRACTABLE MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; MDR-TB; SURVIVAL; 1ST-LINE; IMPACT
10.5588_ijtld.11.0122	Trends in drug-resistant tuberculosis in a gold-mining workforce in South Africa, 2002-2008	SETTING AND OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in two gold-mining work-forces, South Africa, 2002-2008. DESIGN: TB programme data analysis. RESULTS: TB case notification rates decreased between 2002 and 2008 from 4006 to 3018 per 100000 and from 3192 to 2468/100 000 for Companies A and B, respectively. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence exceeded 80% in TB episodes with known status. The proportion of TB episodes with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) increased from 6/129 (4.7%) to 17/85 (20.0%) among previously treated cases, and from 4/38 (10.4%) to 7/28 (25.0%) in Companies A and B, respectively (tests for trend, Company A, P < 0.001; Company B, P = 0.304). Case notifications of MDR-TB increased during 2002-2008 from 39.8 to 122.9/100 000/year in Company A and from 7.8 to 96.8/100 000/year in Company B. Coverage of second-line drug susceptibility testing (DST) among MDR-TB episodes was low. Previous treatment exposure was a strong risk factor for MDR-TB (prevalence ratio 8.78, 95%CI 5.94-12.97 in previously treated vs. untreated individuals). CONCLUSION: Despite decreasing TB notifications overall, MDR-TB notifications and proportions of episodes with MDR-TB increased in the larger company. Cure must be ensured in first episodes to prevent acquired resistance. Improved coverage of culture, DST and HIV testing is required to allow treatment to be optimised.	multidrug resistance; HIV; drug susceptibility testing; isoniazid; rifampicin	ISONIAZID PREVENTIVE THERAPY; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; HIV-INFECTION; RISK; PREVALENCE; MINERS; OUTCOMES; DISEASE; IMPACT
10.1016_j.socscimed.2012.02.039	Representations of MDR and XDR-TB in South African newspapers	The emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis has brought with it diverse perspectives concerning the way in which the disease should be managed. The media is an important source of these perspectives, as they perform the dual role of reflecting and shaping public discourse. In this study, we are interested in how the media presents multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in South Africa, where both variants are a growing public health concern. We examined newspaper content from 310 South African newspaper articles from February 2004 to July 2009 that discussed MDR-TB and XDR-TB. Newspaper articles were collected from the Dow Jones Factiva database and imported into QDA Miner v3.2.1 for analysis. Using Attride-Stirling's thematic network analysis method, articles were analyzed according to themes, sub-themes, and thematic networks. This analysis identified two main dimensions: causes of MDR/XDR-TB and treatment approaches/solutions. Causes of MDR/XDR-TB revolved around three main global themes: i) patient-centred causes (32.6%); ii) lack of infection control procedures (18.7%); and iii) health systems failures (19.4%). Treatment approaches or solutions to tackling MDR/XDR-TB focused on i) patient targeted solutions (38.4%); ii) improving infection control (12.3%); iii) systems restructuring (10.6%); and iv) new diagnostic and therapeutic options (10%). Our analysis identifies a trend in the South African media to identify a broad range of causes of MDR/XDR-TB, while emphasizing that treatment approaches should be directed primarily at the individual. Of particular importance is the fact that such a perspective runs contrary to the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations for approaching the TB epidemic, in particular by insufficiently addressing systemic and social drivers of the epidemic. Due to the media's potential influence on policy formation, how the media presents issues especially issues pertaining to emerging public health concerns should warrant more attention.

10.1136_thoraxjnl_2011_200018	Factors contributing to the high prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a study from China	Background The rapid spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has attracted global concerns. This study aimed to identify factors contributing to the high prevalence of MDR-TB in China's Heilongjiang province. Methods A cross-sectional survey following the WHO/International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease guidelines was conducted with consecutive recruitment of patients with TB in 30 counties selected at random in Heilongjiang in 2004. A total of 1995 patients were tested for MDR-TB. Factors associated with MDR-TB were identified through multilevel models and traditional logistic regression analysis, along with in-depth interviews with nine patients, five healthcare managers and four doctors. Results 241 patients (12%) were identified with MDR-TB. The retreatment patients were 5.48 times (95% CI 4.04 to 7.44) more likely to have MDR-TB than newly diagnosed patients. The patients who were treated with isoniazid and rifampin for >180 days were 4.82 times (95% CI 2.97 to 7.81) more likely to develop MDR-TB than those treated <180 days. Age and delay in initiating TB treatment were associated with MDR-TB. Financial burden, poor knowledge and side effects of TB treatment were perceived by the interviewees as influencing factors. Lack of coordination of services, unsatisfactory supervision of treatment and infection control jeopardised the control of MDR-TB. Conclusions Inappropriate treatment is the most important influencing factor of MDR-TB. Increasing people's awareness of TB, early detection and appropriate treatment of patients with TB should become a priority, which requires strong commitment and collaboration among health organisations and greater compliance with TB treatment guidelines by service providers and patients.

10.5588_ijtld.11.0502	Impact of patient and program factors on default during treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: In the Philippines, programmatic treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) was initiated by the Tropical Disease Foundation in 1999 and transitioned to the National TB Program in 2006. OBJECTIVE: To determine patient and socio-demographic characteristics associated with default, and the impact of patient support measures on default. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis of 583 MDR-TB patients treated from 1999 to 2006. RESULTS: A total of 88 (15%) patients defaulted from treatment. The median follow-up time for patients who defaulted was 289 days (range 1-846). In multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex and previous TB treatment, receiving a greater number of treatment drugs vs. (>= 5 2-3 drugs, HR 7.2, 95%CI 3.3-16.0, P < 0.001) was significantly associated with an increased risk of default, while decentralization reduced the risk of default (HR 0.3, 95%CI 0.2-0.7, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Improving access to treatment for MDR-TB through decentralization of care to centers near the patient's residence reduced the risk of default. Further research is needed to evaluate the feasibility, impact and cost-effectiveness of decentralized care models for MDR-TB treatment.	drug-resistant tuberculosis; treatment adherence; patient incentives; risk factors; program interventions	
10.1007_s10096_011_1453_1	Performance of the GenoType (R) MTBDRPlus assay in routine settings: a multicenter study	Former Soviet Union countries including the Baltic States (Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia) are hot spots for an emerging epidemic of drug resistant tuberculosis (TB). As a part of the development of a co-ordinated network of centers for diagnostic trials across Eastern Europe we conducted a retrospective multicenter analysis of the performance of the GenoTypeA (R) MTBDRPlus assay for TB identification and susceptibility to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF) in routine settings. A total of 1,045 primary samples, 1045 TB cultures derived from these specimens and 306 separate M. tuberculosis isolates tested in 2007-2010 at four participating sites (Tartu, Estonia; Riga, Latvia; Vilnius, Lithuania; and Samara, Russian Federation) were included in the analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity values for RIF and INH were 95.3% and 95.5%, 89.9 and 87.1%, respectively; there were no statistically significant variations in performance across sites. The proportion of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains in the collections ranged from 21.8% (in Estonia) to 55.9% (in Russia). In a routine non-trial context, the assay reliably detected both rifampicin and isoniazid resistance. The absence of statistically significant differences between sites suggested that the comparable performance obtained using these assays has helped demonstrate the formation of a successful diagnostic trial network.

10.1371_journal.pone.0039754	New Insights into Fluoroquinolone Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis: Functional Genetic Analysis of gyrA and gyrB Mutations	Fluoroquinolone antibiotics are among the most potent second-line drugs used for treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB), and resistance to this class of antibiotics is one criterion for defining extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB). Fluoroquinolone resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been associated with modification of the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of gyrA. Recent studies suggest that amino acid substitutions in gyrB may also play a crucial role in resistance, but functional genetic studies of these mutations in M. tuberculosis are lacking. In this study, we examined twenty six mutations in gyrase genes gyrA (seven) and gyrB (nineteen) to determine the clinical relevance and role of these mutations in fluoroquinolone resistance. Transductants or clinical isolates harboring T80A, T80A+A90G, A90G, G247S and A384V gyrA mutations were susceptible to all fluoroquinolones tested. The A74S mutation conferred low-level resistance to moxifloxacin but susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin, and the A74S+D94G double mutation conferred cross resistance to all the fluoroquinolones tested. Functional genetic analysis and structural modeling of gyrB suggest that M330I, V340L, R485C, D500A, D533A, A543T, A543V and T546M mutations are not sufficient to confer resistance as determined by agar proportion. Only three mutations, N538D, E540V and R485C+T539N, conferred resistance to all four fluoroquinolones in at least one genetic background. The D500H and D500N mutations conferred resistance only to levofloxacin and ofloxacin while N538K and E540D consistently conferred resistance to moxifloxacin only. Transductants and clinical isolates harboring T539N, T539P or N538T+T546M mutations exhibited low-level resistance to moxifloxacin only but not consistently. These findings indicate that certain mutations in gyrB confer fluoroquinolone resistance, but the level and pattern of resistance varies among the different mutations. The results from this study provide support for the inclusion of the QRDR of gyrB in molecular assays used to detect fluoroquinolone resistance in M. tuberculosis.

10.1371_journal.pone.0038816	Implementing the Global Plan to Stop TB, 2011-2015-Optimizing Allocations and the Global Fund's Contribution: A Scenario Projections Study	Background: The Global Plan to Stop TB estimates funding required in low- and middle-income countries to achieve TB control targets set by the Stop TB Partnership within the context of the Millennium Development Goals. We estimate the contribution and impact of Global Fund investments under various scenarios of allocations across interventions and regions. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using Global Plan assumptions on expected cases and mortality, we estimate treatment costs and mortality impact for diagnosis and treatment for drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), including antiretroviral treatment (ART) during DOTS for HIV-co-infected patients, for four country groups, overall and for the Global Fund investments. In 2015, China and India account for 24% of funding need, Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA) for 33%, sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) for 20%, and other low-and middle-income countries for 24%. Scale-up of MDR-TB treatment, especially in EECA, drives an increasing global TB funding need - an essential investment to contain the mortality burden associated with MDR-TB and future disease costs. Funding needs rise fastest in SSA, reflecting increasing coverage need of improved TB/HIV management, which saves most lives per dollar spent in the short term. The Global Fund is expected to finance 8-12% of Global Plan implementation costs annually. Lives saved through Global Fund TB support within the available funding envelope could increase 37% if allocations shifted from current regional demand patterns to a prioritized scale-up of improved TB/HIV treatment and secondly DOTS, both mainly in Africa - with EECA region, which has disproportionately high per-patient costs, funded from alternative resources. Conclusions/Significance: These findings, alongside country funding gaps, domestic funding and implementation capacity and equity considerations, should inform strategies and policies for international donors, national governments and disease control programs to implement a more optimal investment approach focusing on highest-impact populations and interventions.

10.1371_journal.pone.0038409	A Molecular Epidemiological and Genetic Diversity Study of Tuberculosis in Ibadan, Nnewi and Abuja, Nigeria	"Background: Nigeria has the tenth highest burden of tuberculosis (TB) among the 22 TB high-burden countries in the world. This study describes the biodiversity and epidemiology of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB in Ibadan, Nnewi and Abuja, using 409 DNAs extracted from culture positive TB isolates. Methodology/Principal Findings: DNAs extracted from clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex were studied by spoligotyping and 24 VNTR typing. The Cameroon clade (CAM) was predominant followed by the M. africanum (West African 1) and T (mainly T2) clades. By using a smooth definition of clusters, 32 likely epi-linked clusters related to the Cameroon genotype family and 15 likely epi-linked clusters related to other ""modern'' genotypes were detected. Eight clusters concerned M. africanum West African 1. The recent transmission rate of TB was 38%. This large study shows that the recent transmission of TB in Nigeria is high, without major regional differences, with MDR-TB clusters. Improvement in the TB control programme is imperative to address the TB control problem in Nigeria."

10.1371_journal.pone.0039187	Rifampicin for Continuation Phase Tuberculosis Treatment in Uganda: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis	Background: In Uganda, isoniazid plus ethambutol is used for 6 months (6HE) during the continuation treatment phase of new tuberculosis (TB) cases. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using isoniazid plus rifampicin for 4 months (4HR) instead of 6HE. We compared the impact of a continuation phase using 6HE or 4HR on total cost and expected mortality from the perspective of the Ugandan national health system. Methodology/Principal Findings: Treatment costs and outcomes were determined by decision analysis. Median daily drug price was US$0.115 for HR and US$0.069 for HE. TB treatment failure or relapse and mortality rates associated with 6HE vs. 4HR were obtained from randomized trials and systematic reviews for HIV-negative (46% of TB cases; failure/relapse -6HE: 10.4% vs. 4HR: 5.2%; mortality -6HE: 5.6% vs. 4HR: 3.5%) and HIV-positive patients (54% of TB cases; failure or relapse -6HE: 13.7% vs. 4HR: 12.4%; mortality -6HE: 16.6% vs. 4HR: 10.5%). When the initial treatment is not successful, retreatment involves an additional 8-month drug-regimen at a cost of $110.70. The model predicted a mortality rate of 13.3% for patients treated with 6HE and 8.8% for 4HR; average treatment cost per patient was predicted at $26.07 for 6HE and $23.64 for 4HR. These results were robust to the inclusion of MDR-TB as an additional outcome after treatment failure or relapse. Conclusions/Significance: Combination therapy with 4HR in the continuation phase dominates 6HE as it is associated with both lower expected costs and lower expected mortality. These data support the WHO recommendation to transition to a continuation phase comprising 4HR.		MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; 2 8-MONTH REGIMENS; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; METAANALYSIS; OUTCOMES
10.7196_SAMJ.5361	Delay in commencing treatment for MDR TB at a specialised TB treatment centre in KwaZulu-Natal	Background. According to the National Department of Health (NDoH) guidelines, patients diagnosed with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) must be referred to a specialised treatment centre for initiation of effective therapy. MDR TB is difficult to diagnose and the centralised referral model is beset with challenges that contribute to treatment delays, increased patient morbidity and mortality, and MDR TB nosocomial transmission. Culture and drug sensitivity testing (DST) takes 8 weeks or longer to obtain results while line probe assays (LPAs) can give a result in hours. LPAs and the GeneXpert MTB/Rif (GX) are ground-breaking discoveries for TB diagnosis. However, they are not easily accessible or available to those needing it, so culture and sensitivity testing remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Aim. This study aimed to assess the delay in the initiation of MDR TB treatment and profiled the patients being referred to a specialised drug-resistant treatment centre in KwaZulu-Natal. Results. Of all the patients, 75% referred showed a mean delay of 12.4 weeks from the date of sputum collection for culture and drug sensitivity testing to the start of treatment. Most of the patients were symptomatic for TB and HIV-positive. Discussion. Our findings suggest that current policy on the initiation of effective treatment needs urgent revision. Staff should be appropriately trained in LPA and GX technology to reduce delays in initiating treatment for MDR TB. The NDoH's plans for rapid diagnosis and reducing the treatment burden on centralised MDR TB management facilities are in the early phases of implementation and will take years to achieve favourable and significant outcomes. Conclusion. There is a significant delay in initiating definitive management for MDR TB.		TUBERCULOSIS
10.7196_SAMJ.4964	Aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss in HIV-positive and HIV-negative multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients	Background. Ototoxicity following aminoglycoside treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), is a significant problem. This study documents the incidence of ototoxicity in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients with MDR-TB and presents clinical guidelines relating to ototoxicity. Methods. A prospective cohort study of 153 MDR-TB patients with normal hearing and middle ear status at baseline controlling for 6 mitochondrial mutations associated with aminoglycoside-related ototoxicity, at Brooklyn Chest Hospital in Cape Town. Pure tone audiometry was performed monthly for 3 months to determine hearing loss. HIV status was recorded, as was the presence of 6 mutations in the MT-RNR1 gene. Results. Fifty-seven per cent developed high-frequency hearing loss. HIV-positive patients (70%) were more likely to develop hearing loss than HIV-negative patients (42%). Of 115 patients who were genetically screened, none had MT-RNR1 mutations. Conclusion. Ototoxic hearing loss is common in MDR-TB patients treated with aminoglycosides. HIV-positive patients are at increased risk of ototoxicity. Auditory monitoring and auditory rehabilitation should be an integral part of the package of care of MDR-TB patients.		OTOTOXICITY; RISK
pub-1176	Tuberculosis Drug Resistance and Outcomes among Tuberculosis Inpatients in Lilongwe, Malawi	Setting/Objective: We evaluated clinical characteristics, yield of solid vs. liquid culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based drug-resistance profiles, and clinical outcomes of tuberculosis (TB) inpatients in Lilongwe, Malawi. Design: We enrolled adult patients admitted to the Bwaila TB Ward from Jan-Aug/2010. Evaluations included questionnaires, clinical exam, chest radiograph, HIV status, CD4 lymphocyte count, plasma HIVRNA and sputum analysis including Auramine-O stain, Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) and Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) culture, and susceptibility testing using the HAIN GenoType (R) MTBDRplus. Results: Eighty-eight patients were enrolled (88% re-treatment, 42% smear positive, 93% pulmonary TB, 74% HIV co-infected). At baseline, 44/88 (50%) MGIT and 28 (32%) LJ cultures were positive with a mean time to positivity of 12.1 (Range 1-42) and 21.5 (Range 7-58) days, respectively. Four percent (3/77) of retreatment patients or 8% of the 38 MGIT+ PCR-confirmed retreatment cases had multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). One MDR TB patient was smear negative and only one MDR patient was identified with LJ. Lower mean hemoglobin at admission was associated with mortality (10.5 vs. 7.5; p<0.01; CI 101 9.8-11.0). Conclusions: The MDR TB burden among the retreatment population in Lilongwe, Malawi is similar to regional estimates by the WHO (7.7% 95% CI 0-18.1). MDR TB patients are not routinely identified with sputum smear or LJ, suggesting more efficient technology should be adopted.

10.1183_09031936.00145411	Alarming levels of drug-resistant tuberculosis in Belarus: results of a survey in Minsk	Resistance to anti-tuberculosis (TB) medicines is a major public health threat in most countries of the former Soviet Union. As no representative and quality-assured information on the magnitude of this problem existed in Belarus, a survey was conducted in the capital city of Minsk. Between November 2009 and December 2010, 156 consecutively diagnosed new and 68 previously treated culture-positive TB patients residing in Minsk were enrolled in the survey. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were obtained from each patient and tested for susceptibility to first- and second-line anti-TB drugs. Multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB was found in 35.3% (95% Cl 27.7-42.8) of new patients and 76.5% (95% Cl 66.1-86.8) of those previously treated. Overall, nearly one in two patients enrolled had MDR-TB. Extensively drug-resistant TB was reported in 15 of the 107 MDR-TB patients (14.0%, 95% Cl 7.3-20.7). Patients <35 yrs of age have shown a two times higher odds ratio of multidrug-resistant TB than those aged >35 yrs. The findings of this survey in Minsk city are alarming and represent the highest proportions of MDR-TB ever recorded in the world. This study greatly contributes to the understanding of the burden of drug-resistant TB in urban areas of Belarus.

10.1183_09031936.00125711	Multidrug resistance after inappropriate tuberculosis treatment: a meta-analysis	We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence for the postulation that inappropriate tuberculosis (TB) regimens are a risk for development of multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB. MEDLINE, EMBASE and other databases were searched for relevant articles in January 2011. Cohort studies including TB patients who received treatment were selected and data on treatment regimen, drug susceptibility testing results and genotyping results before treatment and at failure or relapse were abstracted from the articles. Four studies were included in the systematic review and two were included in the meta-analysis. In these two studies the risk of developing MDR-TB in patients who failed treatment and used an inappropriate treatment regimen was increased 27-fold (RR 26.7, 95% CI 5.0-141.7) when compared with individuals who received an appropriate treatment regimen. This review provides evidence that supports the general opinion that the development of MDR-TB can be caused by inadequate treatment, given the drug susceptibility pattern of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli. It should be noted that only two studies provided data for the meta-analysis. The information can be used to advocate for adequate treatment for patients based on drug resistance profiles.

10.1128_AAC.06418_11	Molecular Characterization of Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolated in Nepal	Despite the fact that Nepal is one of the first countries globally to introduce multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) case management, the number of MDR-TB cases is continuing to rise in Nepal. Rapid molecular tests applicable in this setting to identify resistant organisms would be an effective tool in reversing this trend. To develop such tools, information about the frequency and distribution of mutations that are associated with phenotypic drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is required. In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of mutations in rpoB and katG genes and the inhA promoter region in 158 M. tuberculosis isolates (109 phenotypically MDR and 49 non-MDR isolates collected in Nepal) by DNA sequencing. Mutations affecting the 81-bp rifampin (RIF) resistance-determining region (RRDR) of rpoB were identified in 106 of 109 (97.3%) RIP-resistant isolates. Codons 531, 526, and 516 were the most commonly affected, at percentages of 58.7, 15.6, and 15.6%, respectively. Of 113 isoniazid (INH)-resistant isolates, 99 (87.6%) had mutations in the katG gene, with Ser315Thr being the most prevalent (81.4%) substitution. Mutations in the inhA promoter region were detected in 14 (12.4%) INH-resistant isolates. The results from this study provide an overview of the current situation of RIF and INH resistance in M. tuberculosis in Nepal and can serve as a basis for developing or improving rapid molecular tests to monitor drug-resistant strains in this country.

10.5588_ijtld.11.0522	First- and second-line anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in Northwest Ethiopia	SETTING: Gondar Hospital, Gondar Health Centre, Metemma Hospital, Bahir Dar Hospital and Debre Markos Hospital in Northwest Ethiopia. OBJECTIVE: To assess the level of and risk factors for first- and second-line drug resistance among tuberculosis (TB) patients. DESIGN: Drug susceptibility testing (DST) against first-line drugs, including isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP), streptomycin (SM), ethambutol (EMB) and pyrazinamide (PZA), was performed using the BacT/ALERT 3D system. DST against second-line drugs, including fluoroquinolones and aminoglycocides/cyclic peptides, was performed using Geno Type MTBDRsl. RESULTS: Of 260 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, 41 (15.8%) were resistant to at least one first-line drug, 13 (5.0%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR) and 9 (3.5%) were resistant to all first-line drugs. Any resistance to INH, RMP, SM, EMB and PZA was respectively 36 (13.8%), 15 (5.8%), 26 (10.0%), 19 (7.3%) and 12 (4.6%). Of 214 new and 46 previously treated cases, respectively 8 (3.7%) and 5 (10.9%) were MDR. All isolates were susceptible to all second-line drugs. CONCLUSION: A substantial number of new and previously treated cases harbour MDR-TB. We recommend DST at least for previously treated cases, patients who remain smear-positive at the end of the second month of treatment and patients in close contact with MDR-TB cases. Improved infection control measures need to be implemented in Ethiopia.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs; second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; CAMEROON; YAOUNDE
10.1016_j.meegid.2011.07.019	Emergence and treatment of multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis in South Africa	Drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) has reached alarming proportions in South Africa, draining valuable resources that are needed to fight drug susceptible TB. It is currently estimated that 9.6% of all TB cases have multi-drug resistant (MDR)-TB, thereby ranking South Africa as one of the highest MDR-TB burden countries in the world. Molecular epidemiological studies have demonstrated the complexity of the epidemic and have clearly shown that the epidemic is driven by transmission as a consequence of low cases detection and diagnostic delay. The latter has in turn fueled the amplification of drug resistance, ultimately leading to the emergence of extensively drug resistant (XDR)-TB. Despite the introduction of new drugs to combat this scourge, culture conversion rates for XDR-TB remain below 20%. Failure to achieve cure may be explained from DNA sequencing results which have demonstrated mutations in 7 genes encoding resistance to at least 8 anti-TB drugs. This review shows how molecular epidemiology has provided novel insights into the MDR-TB epidemic in South Africa and thereby has highlighted the challenges that need to be addressed regarding the diagnosis and treatment of MDR-TB. An important step towards for curbing this epidemic will be collaboration between clinicians, laboratories and researchers to establish scientific knowledge and medical expertise to more efficiently guide public health policy.

10.1016_j.meegid.2011.05.016	Long-term molecular surveillance of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Spain	The data presented here span 11 years (1998-2008) of monitoring of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) clustering through molecular typing techniques in Spain. The molecular and epidemiological data of 480 multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates were analyzed. Thirty-one clusters involving 157 (32.7%) patients were identified. The proportion of immigrants increased substantially over the study period reaching 65% in 2008; however, the clustering rate remained stable indicating that local transmission was little influenced by imported MDR-TB. The three major clusters respond to the persistence of two autochthonous strains throughout the study period and an extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Mycobacterium bovis outbreak with only two cases was reported since 2002. Molecular and epidemiological evidence for the importation of new strains and their spread within the community was found. Immigrant-only clusters most often grouped patients infected abroad with strains belonging to rare spoligotypes. Conversely, widespread spoligotypes of the Latin-American and Mediterranean (LAM) and Haarlem families were responsible for the majority of the MDR-TB local transmission. The demonstration of clusters spanning several Spanish regions that have been ongoing throughout the study period makes it advisable to maintain a continuous molecular surveillance in order to monitor the spread of MDR-TB.

10.1016_j.meegid.2011.09.022	The population structure of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from Sichuan in China	China ranks second next to India among 22 high-burden countries despite decades' effort on tuberculosis (TB) control. The Sichuan province today contains the second-largest number of TB cases among Chinese provinces, where the prevalence of drug-resistant TB, especially MDR-TB, is much higher than the average level in eastern China. In this study, the population structure and the transmission characteristics of drug-resistant TB in Sichuan province were studied by spoligotyping and 24-locus Mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number tandem DNA repeats (MIRU-VNTR), applied to a total of 306 clinical isolates. Spoligotyping-based analysis showed that Beijing family represented 69.28% of all isolates and constituted the largest group (66.24%) of MDR-TB in Sichuan. The remaining isolates, accounting for 33.76% of MDR isolates, belonged to the ill-defined T family, Manu2, H3, LAM9, and other minor unassigned clades. The discriminatory power evaluated for spoligotyping was poor (HGI = 0.595), but high for 24-locus MIRU-VNTRs (NCI = 0.999). The number of the most discriminatory loci (h > 0.6) was 12, including locus 424, 802, 960, 1644, 1955, 2163b, 2996, 3007, 3192, 3690, 4348 and 4052. It was concluded that 24-locus MIRU-VNTRs could be a more discriminatory tool for differentiating clinical isolates from Sichuan region. The small clustering size obtained from the current population structure analysis suggested that the high prevalence of drug-resistant TB in this region might be attributed partially to the acquired resistance due to inappropriate drug use rather than active transmission of drug-resistant TB (primary resistance).

10.1017_S0950268811001476	Adverse events and development of tuberculosis after 4 months of rifampicin prophylaxis in a tuberculosis outbreak	We screened tuberculosis (TB) contacts as an outbreak investigation with tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). We evaluated adverse events and TB incidence in all persons screened after rifampicin (RFP) prophylaxis, and specifically assessed the new TB cases in relation to initial TST and IGRA results. The 180 contacts were divided into four groups: TST+/IGRA+ (n=101), TST+/IGRA- (n=22), TST-/IGRA+ (n=16), and TST-/IGRA-(n=41). RFP treatment (4 months) was prescribed only to the TST+/IGRA+ group. Of 87 contacts who initiated prophylaxis, adverse events occurred in 21 contacts (24.1%) including hepatotoxicity (11.5%), flu-like syndrome (5.7%), and thrombocytopenia (3.4%). TB developed in two TST+/IGRA+ subjects after completion of prophylaxis, including one multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB case during 21.8 months of follow-up. Adverse events were frequent, and development of TB including MDR-TB occurred after RFP prophylaxis.

10.1093_jac_dks078	Daily 300 mg dose of linezolid for multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis: updated analysis of 51 patients	Linezolid may be an effective treatment for multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB). The objective was to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and adverse events of a 300 mg daily dose of linezolid in the treatment of MDR/XDR-TB. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 51 MDR-TB patients, including 26 patients (51) with XDR-TB, to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of therapy with 300 mg/day linezolid. All patients had failed previous treatments with second-line anti-TB drugs. Patients were treated with linezolid for a median of 413 days (IQR 237622 days). Favourable treatment outcome (treatment success or still on treatment after culture conversion) was achieved in 40 patients (78) with culture conversion at a median of 55 days (IQR 4191 days) from the start of linezolid therapy. Eleven patients (22) had unfavourable outcomes (treatment failure or death) and 14 (27) discontinued treatment due to neurotoxicity (peripheral or optic neuropathy) after a median of 278 days (IQR 174412 days). Our findings suggest that linezolid at a daily dose of 300 mg is effective against intractable MDR/XDR-TB, and may be associated with fewer neuropathic side effects than a daily dose of 600 or 1200 mg.

10.1016_j.ejpb.2012.02.017	New times, new trends for ethionamide: In vitro evaluation of drug-loaded thermally carbonized porous silicon microparticles	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has become a worldwide problem and a major public health concern. The mechanisms of resistance are fairly well characterized for most agents, but MDR limits the therapeutic usefulness of both new and classical medicines against TB. Ethionamide (ETA) is a thioamide antibiotic and one of the most widely used drugs as second line agent for the treatment of MDR-TB. Over the years, some studies have emerged to improve the bioavailability of this drug and of its active metabolites. However, inactive metabolites of ETA are still a major drawback in its application against TB. Porous silicon (PSi) materials can be applied to improve the dissolution behavior of poorly water-soluble compounds and to overcome toxicity and other drug-related problems in oral delivery. In the present work, we have loaded ETA into thermally carbonized-PSi (TCPSi) microparticles and studied the solubility, toxicity, permeability, and metabolic profiles of the PSi-loaded drug. The solubility and permeability of ETA was clearly enhanced after loaded into TCPSi particles at different pH-values. ETA was in general toxic at concentrations above 0.50 mM to HepG2. Caco-2, and RAW macrophage cells, but the toxicity was drastically reduced when the drug was loaded into the microparticles. ETA showed a fast metabolization process in the presence of the TCPSi particles. In addition, new thiolated metabolites were identified from incubation of ETA-loaded PSi with HepG2 liver cells, which opens new perspectives toward both the understanding of ETA metabolism and the development of novel ETA-based systems with improved efficacy against MDR-TB.

10.5588_ijtld.11.0252	Diagnostic sensitivity of culture and drug resistance patterns in Korean patients with intestinal tuberculosis	SETTING: It is challenging to differentiate between intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) and Crohn's disease in areas where TB is still prevalent. The use of diagnostic tools and verifying the drug resistance patterns of ITB can be helpful for its correct diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic sensitivity of a culture assay using colonoscopic biopsy specimens and the drug resistance patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from ITB. DESIGN: Data from 400 patients diagnosed with ITB were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: Of the 400 patients, 170 (42.5%) were males; the median age at diagnosis was 40 years. The sensitivity of culture was 44.1% (145/329). Resistance to at least one anti-tuberculosis drug was identified in 13 (17.6%) and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was diagnosed in two (2.7%) of the 74 patients for whom drug susceptibility testing was performed. Including M. tuberculosis isolated from respiratory specimens, the proportion of MDR-TB was 4.4% (5/113); previous anti-tuberculosis treatment was an independent risk factor for MDR-TB (26.7% vs. 1.0%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Culture of colonoscopic biopsy specimens shows substantial diagnostic sensitivity; the frequency of MDR-TB is higher in previously treated cases than in new cases.

10.1111_j.1600_0463.2011.02861.x	Primary drug resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs in major towns of Amhara region, Ethiopia	Yimer SA, Agonafir M, Derese Y, Sani Y, Bjune GA, Holm-Hansen C. Primary drug resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs in major towns of Amhara Region, Ethiopia. APMIS 2012; 120: 5039. Drug resistance is a major obstacle to effective TB control program performance. In this study, we assessed the prevalence of primary drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) isolates in Amhara Region, Ethiopia. A total of 112 Mtb isolates from cases with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB were subjected to drug susceptibility testing (DST) in a cross-sectional study. Isolates were tested for sensitivity to isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and streptomycin using the MGIT 960 protocol. A total of 93 Mtb isolates yielded valid DST results and 28 (30.1%) were resistant to one or more of first line anti-TB drugs. One isolate (1.0%) was multi-drug resistant (MDR), five (5.4%) were classified as poly-resistant and 22 showed single drug resistance to either streptomycin (n = 19) or isoniazid (n = 3). Isolates from HIV-positive patients were more likely to be resistant to at least one of the four anti-TB drugs compared with HIV-negative individuals (odds ratio 2.76, 95% confidence interval 1.067.22; p = 0.03). The study showed a high prevalence of primary drug resistance. Even though the prevalence of MDR was low, conditions that can contribute to the development of MDR are increasing. Therefore, regular monitoring of drug resistance and enhanced implementation of TB/HIV collaborative activities in the study region are imperative.

10.1007_s10096_011_1434_4	Characterization of Th1-and Th2-type immune response in human multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has become a lethal global threat. Insights into the immune regulation of MDR-TB are urgently needed for the development of new treatments; however, the T cell response to an MDR-TB infection in human remains unclear. In the present study, the proportion of Th1 and Th2 cell subsets and the level of related T cell subset cytokines in peripheral blood were investigated. We detected that an MDR-TB infection resulted in suppressed Th1 and Th2 cell activation, which was more remarkable in patients with MDR-TB than that in drug-sensitive tuberculosis (DS-TB) sufferers when compared to healthy controls (HCs). In addition, MDR-TB infection down-regulated the expression of IFN-gamma, IL-2, and IL-10, and up-regulated IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-alpha expression. Our data suggest that the disturbance between protective and pathogenic effects induced by the immunosuppression of Th1- and Th2-type responses is a substantial characteristic of MDR-TB infections.

The compounds were tested for their in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (MTB) and multi-drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Most of the compounds showed excellent activity toward MDR-TB. Among the thirty compounds (4,5a-o) tested N,N-dibenzyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide (5g) was found to be the most potent compound MICs of 0.55 and 0.12 mu M against MTB and MDR-TB.

10.1371_journal.pone.0036966	The Impact and Cost of Scaling up GeneXpert MTB/RIF in South Africa	Objective: We estimated the incremental cost and impact on diagnosis and treatment uptake of national rollout of Xpert MTB/RIF technology (Xpert) for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB above the cost of current guidelines for the years 2011 to 2016 in South Africa. Methods: We parameterised a population-level decision model with data from national-level TB databases (n = 199,511) and implementation studies. The model follows cohorts of TB suspects from diagnosis to treatment under current diagnostic guidelines or an algorithm that includes Xpert. Assumptions include the number of TB suspects, symptom prevalence of 5.5%, annual suspect growth rate of 10%, and 2010 public-sector salaries and drug and service delivery costs. Xpert test costs are based on data from an in-country pilot evaluation and assumptions about when global volumes allowing cartridge discounts will be reached. Results: At full scale, Xpert will increase the number of TB cases diagnosed per year by 30%-37% and the number of MDR-TB cases diagnosed by 69%-71%. It will diagnose 81% of patients after the first visit, compared to 46% currently. The cost of TB diagnosis per suspect will increase by 55% to USD 60-61 and the cost of diagnosis and treatment per TB case treated by 8% to USD 797-873. The incremental capital cost of the Xpert scale-up will be USD 22 million and the incremental recurrent cost USD 287-316 million over six years. Conclusion: Xpert will increase both the number of TB cases diagnosed and treated and the cost of TB diagnosis. These results do not include savings due to reduced transmission of TB as a result of earlier diagnosis and treatment initiation.		TUBERCULOSIS; DIAGNOSIS; IMPLEMENTATION; RESISTANCE
10.1371_journal.pone.0037114	Outcomes of Comprehensive Care for Children Empirically Treated for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in a Setting of High HIV Prevalence	Background: Few studies have examined outcomes for children treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), including those receiving concomitant treatment for MDR-TB and HIV co-infection. In Lesotho, where the adult HIV seroprevalence is estimated to be 24%, we sought to measure outcomes and adverse events in a cohort of children treated for MDR-TB using a community-based treatment delivery model. Methods: We reviewed retrospectively the clinical charts of children <= 15 years of age treated for culture-confirmed or suspected MDR-TB between July 2007 and January 2011. Results: Nineteen children, ages two to 15, received treatment. At baseline, 74% of patients were co-infected with HIV, 63% were malnourished, 84% had severe radiographic findings, and 21% had extrapulmonary disease. Five (26%) children had culture-confirmed MDR-TB, ten (53%) did not have culture results available, and four (21%) subsequently had results indicating drug-susceptible TB. All children with HIV co-infection who were not already on antiretroviral therapy (ART) were initiated on ART a median of two weeks after the start of the MDR-TB regimen. Among the 17 patients with final outcomes, 15 (88%) patients were cured or completed treatment, two (12%) patients died, and none defaulted or were lost to follow-up. The majority of patients (95%) experienced adverse events; only two required permanent discontinuation of the offending agent, and only one required suspension of MDR-TB treatment for more than one week. Conclusions: Pediatric MDR-TB and MDR-TB/HIV co-infection can be successfully treated using a combination of social support, close monitoring by community health workers and clinicians, and inpatient care when needed. In this cohort, adverse events were well tolerated and treatment outcomes were comparable to those reported in children with drug-susceptible TB and no HIV infection.

10.1164_rccm.201107_1190OC	Surgical Face Masks Worn by Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Impact on Infectivity of Air on a Hospital Ward	Rationale: Drug-resistant tuberculosis transmission in hospitals threatens staff and patient health. Surgical face masks used by patients with tuberculosis (TB) are believed to reduce transmission but have not been rigorously tested. Objectives: We sought to quantify the efficacy of surgical face masks when worn by patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Methods: Over 3 months, 17 patients with pulmonary MDR-TB occupied an MDR-TB ward in South Africa and wore face masks on alternate days. Ward air was exhausted to two identical chambers, each housing 90 pathogen-free guinea pigs that breathed ward air either when patients wore surgical face masks (intervention group) or when patients did not wear masks (control group). Efficacy was based on differences in guinea pig infections in each chamber. Measurements and Main Results: Sixty-nine of 90 control guinea pigs (76.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 68-85%) became infected, compared with 36 of 90 intervention guinea pigs (40%; 95% CI, 31-51%), representing a 56% (95% CI, 33-70.5%) decreased risk of TB transmission when patients used masks. Conclusions: Surgical face masks on patients with MDR-TB significantly reduced transmission and offer an adjunct measure for reducing TB transmission from infectious patients.	infection control; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; transmission; surgical mask	HEALTH-CARE WORKERS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; INDOOR ENVIRONMENTS; DROPLET NUCLEI; TRANSMISSION; EMERGENCY; PERU; LIMA
pub-1194	Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis directly from sputum specimens & phenotypic drug resistance pattern of M. tuberculosis isolates from suspected tuberculosis patients in Chennai	Background & objectives: mRNA is more rapidly destroyed in cells than rRNA or genomic DNA, an assay targeting bacterial mRNA would provide a better guide to mycobacterial viability than amplification tests directed at DNA or rRNA targets. This study was carried out to standardize reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) targeting 85B gene for the rapid detection of viable Mycobacterium tuberculosis from sputum specimens of suspected TB patients at Chennai, South India and to detect MDR-TB circulating in this population. Methods: Sputum samples from clinically suspected tuberculosis patients (n=301) and 78 controls were included in the study. The sputum samples were collected in sterile diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated containers and transported in ice to the laboratory within 2 h to prevent degradation of RNA. RT-PCR targeting 85B gene, mycobacterial culture and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing for the first line drugs streptomycin (S), isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R), ethambutol (E) and pyrazinamide (Z) were performed by BACTEC microMGIT culture system for all the sputum specimens. Results: All the 78 controls were negative for culture and RT-PCR. Among the 301 sputum specimens from patients, 231 (76.8%) were RT-PCR positive and 70 (23.2%) were negative. There were 166 M. tuberculosis isolates, of which 11(2.9%) were MDR-TB, 33 (8.7%) were polyresistant, 31(8.2%) were monoresistant and 91(30.2%) were sensitive to all five first line anti-tuberculous drugs by phenotypic drug susceptibility testing. Monoresistance was higher with Z [20 (20.8%)], followed by S [6 (3%)]. Interpretation & conclusions: RT-PCR targeting 85B gene of M. tuberculosis was a specific, rapid, reliable technique to detect the M. tuberculosis directly from sputum specimens. Our results showed that 2.9 per cent of M. tuberculosis isolates in the study population of Chennai were MDR.

10.5588_ijtld.11.0591	Hepatotoxicity during treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: occurrence, management and outcome	SETTING: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment program in Tomsk, Russia. OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence and management of hepatotoxicity during treatment of MDR-TB, and to assess risk factors associated with its development and impact on treatment outcomes. DESIGN: A retrospective case series performed among 608 patients. RESULTS: Hepatotoxicity, using American Thoracic Society (2006) definitions, was observed in 91/568 patients (16.5%). The median time to the first hepatotoxic event was 196 days post treatment commencement. Baseline factors associated with hepatotoxicity included elevated alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase/bilirubin (OR 53.9, 95%CI 6.30-438.7), and renal insufficiency (OR 19.6, 95%CI 2.71-141.6). High treatment adherence (OR 3.25, 95%CI 2.07-5.09) and starting treatment in prison (OR 1.77, 95%CI 1.04-3.01) were associated with treatment success. Smoking (OR 0.44, 95%CI 0.21-0.92) and bilateral cavitary disease (OR 0.51, 95%CI 0.34-0.77) were associated with worse outcomes. For alcohol users, developing hepatotoxicity was associated with better outcomes (OR 4.40, 95%CI 1.79-10.81) than not (OR 0.42, 95%CI 0.25-0.68). One or more medications were permanently stopped in 10/91 patients, but in no case was treatment entirely discontinued. CONCLUSION: MDR-TB treatment in the face of hepatotoxicity during therapy did not result in a statistically significant increase in poor outcomes.	hepatitis; hepatotoxicity; drug-resistant tuberculosis; MDR-TB; Tomsk; Russia	DRUG-INDUCED HEPATOTOXICITY; HEPATITIS-C VIRUS; MDR-TB; ANTITUBERCULOSIS THERAPY; LIVER-INJURY; RISK-FACTORS; RIFAMPIN; ACID; CIPROFLOXACIN; INFECTION
10.5588_ijtld.11.0544	Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in a high-prevalence region through a binational consortium	We describe the outcome of treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Baja California, Mexico, by a United States-Mexico consortium. From June 2006 to December 2010, 42 patients started treatment. Strains were resistant to 4.15 +/- 1.3 drugs; all patients achieved culture conversion on treatment after an average of 3.4 +/- 1.6 months. A total of 19 patients (47.5%) were discharged as cured, 3 died (7.5%) and 1 defaulted (2.5%). MDR-TB cases can be cured under a well-organized out-patient program; in this consortium, the US partner introduced program elements that were gradually integrated into the Mexican state TB program.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; treatment; Mexico	
10.5588_ijtld.11.0507	Population-based surveillance of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in Shandong Province, China	To investigate the prevalence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in Chinese populations, we analyzed the drug resistance profiles of 1787 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates through a population-based surveillance project in Shandong Province, China. We found 330 (18.5%; 95%CI 16.1-20.3) isolates resistant to >= 1 first-line drug and 65 (3.6%; 95%CI 2.9-4.6) multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates, of which 13 (20.0%; 95%CI 11.9-31.4) were XDR; 47/65 MDR-TB isolates (70.8%; 95%CI58.2-81.4) were resistant to fluoroquinolones. Our results indicate that inadequate application of second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs has caused increased prevalence of XDR-TB in certain Chinese populations.

10.5588_ijtld.11.0262	Integration of HIV testing in tuberculosis drug resistance surveillance in Kazakhstan and Kenya	In Kenya and Kazakhstan, integration of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing results into the routine surveillance of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) proved feasible and useful. The integration process improved overall data quality and data validation capacity, and integrated data are a useful addition to routine cohort and treatment outcome data. Besides their importance for individual patient care, they provide trends on the association of MDR-TB and HIV in the routine programme setting. They also form a useful epidemiological basis for more specific studies, such as on nosocomial outbreaks. Whether the system itself is sensitive enough to monitor possible outbreaks needs further investigation.	TB; HIV; drug resistance; Kazakhstan; Kenya	INFECTION
10.1128_AAC.06145_11	Pharmacokinetics of Sequential Doses of Capreomycin Powder for Inhalation in Guinea Pigs	The global control of tuberculosis (TB) is at risk by the spread of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB). Treatment of MDR TB is lengthy and involves injected drugs, such as capreomycin, that have severe side effects. It was previously reported that a single daily dose of inhaled capreomycin had a positive effect on the bacterial burden of TB-infected guinea pigs. The modest effect observed was possibly due to a dose that resulted in insufficient time of exposure to therapeutic systemic and local levels of the drug. In order to determine the length of time that systemic and local drug concentrations are above therapeutic levels during the treatment period, the present study investigated the disposition of capreomycin powders after sequential pulmonary administration of doses of 20 mg/kg of body weight. Capreomycin concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue of animals receiving a series of one, two, or three doses of capreomycin inhalable powder were significantly higher (50- to 100-fold) at all time points than plasma concentrations at the same time points or those observed in animals receiving capreomycin solution by intramuscular (i.m.) injection (10- to 100-fold higher). Notably, at the end of each dosing period, capreomycin concentrations in the lungs were approximately 100-fold higher than those in plasma and severalfold higher than the MIC, suggesting that sufficient capreomycin remains in the lung environment to kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis. No accumulation of capreomycin powder was detected in the lungs after 3 pulmonary doses. These results indicate that the systemic disposition of capreomycin after inhalation is the same as when injected i.m. with the advantage that higher drug concentrations are present at all times in the lungs, the primary site of infection.

10.1016_j.healthplace.2011.05.004	Drug partnerships and global practices	Tuberculosis poses one of the biggest threats to individuals living with HIV in most low-income regions of the world, and the increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in South Africa, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere makes this threat that much more critical. Despite the extent of the problem, new drugs for tuberculosis have not been developed for over four decades, largely because tuberculosis occurs primarily among the poor in low-income regions and the market for tuberculosis drugs is not lucrative enough to warrant time and resource commitments by pharmaceutical companies. In the wake of sustained global criticism of pharmaceutical-state practices, however, new partnerships for drug development (PDPs) are forming to address critical shortages of drugs for diseases like tuberculosis that have been termed 'neglected' precisely because they have not seen new treatments for so long. This paper examines some of these partnerships, tracing some of the dynamic developments as well as challenges in forging alternative pathways to new drug and vaccine production.

10.1186_1742_6405_9_12	A home-based approach to managing multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in Uganda: a case report	This case report describes an HIV-positive patient with recurrent tuberculosis in Uganda. After several failed courses of treatment, the patient was diagnosed with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). As adequate in-patient facilities were unavailable, we advised the patient to remain at home, and he received treatment at home via his family and a community nurse. The patient had a successful clearance of tuberculosis. This strategy of home-based care represents an important opportunity for treatment of patients in East Africa, where human resource constraints and inadequate hospital facilities exist for complex patients at high risk of infection to others.

10.1371_journal.pone.0034538	Contribution of Efflux to the Emergence of Isoniazid and Multidrug Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Multidrug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most effective drugs used in tuberculosis therapy. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which resistance towards isoniazid develops and how overexpression of efflux pumps favors accumulation of mutations in isoniazid targets, thus establishing a MDR phenotype. The study was based on the in vitro induction of an isoniazid resistant phenotype by prolonged serial exposure of M. tuberculosis strains to the critical concentration of isoniazid employed for determination of drug susceptibility testing in clinical isolates. Results show that susceptible and rifampicin monoresistant strains exposed to this concentration become resistant to isoniazid after three weeks; and that resistance observed for the majority of these strains could be reduced by means of efflux pumps inhibitors. RT-qPCR assessment of efflux pump genes expression showed overexpression of all tested genes. Enhanced real-time efflux of ethidium bromide, a common efflux pump substrate, was also observed, showing a clear relation between overexpression of the genes and increased efflux pump function. Further exposure to isoniazid resulted in the selection and stabilization of spontaneous mutations and deletions in the katG gene along with sustained increased efflux activity. Together, results demonstrate the relevance of efflux pumps as one of the factors of isoniazid resistance in M. tuberculosis. These results support the hypothesis that activity of efflux pumps allows the maintenance of an isoniazid resistant population in a sub-optimally treated patient from which isoniazid genetically resistant mutants emerge. Therefore, the use of inhibitors of efflux should be considered in the development of new therapeutic strategies for preventing the emergence of MDR-TB during treatment.

10.4103_0255_0857.96694	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in children from 2003 to 2005: A brief report	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has rarely been reported from children in India. Their response to therapy is also not known. We present four HIV-negative children with MDR-TB (3 children with extra-pulmonary TB and 1 child with pulmonary TB) who presented in 2003-2005. All the four children were already on antituberculous therapy (ATT) for 3-9 months prior to being detected as MDR-TB. These patients were started on second-line ATT for 18 months. In three patients, there was complete resolution, and one patient with severe bilateral pulmonary TB had the disease localized to one lung after 18 months of therapy.

pub-1204	Antimicrobials of plant origin against TB and other infections and Economics of plant drugs -Introspection	An overview on work published on antimicrobial activity of plants indicated that very limited work is reported on antimicrobial activities against multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogenic bacteria, especially the tuberculosis (TB) bacillus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. But considerable work has been done with the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Active principles from the tea tree oil plant, as well as the berberine found in many plants were reported to be effective against MRSA. For the control of many MDR pathogenic bacteria including M. tuberculosis, a systematic screening of plants would be the step towards drug-development from plants that would be economically viable too in the medicinal plant trade. In developing and developed countries phytodrugs with several commercial formulations are amply available, those are economical enough. A discussion on the economics of trade on medicinal plants is done that clarifies that raw products for healthcare are almost universally popular. It is discussed that crude plant extracts as antimicrobials are preferable, since resistance in pathogens would not be easy, for an array of compounds; and drug development for MDR-TB is need of the day.

10.3390_molecules17044545	Systematic Evaluation of Structure-Activity Relationships of the Riminophenazine Class and Discovery of a C2 Pyridylamino Series for the Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Clofazimine, a member of the riminophenazine class of drugs, is the cornerstone agent for the treatment of leprosy. This agent is currently being studied in clinical trials for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis to address the urgent need for new drugs that can overcome existing and emerging drug resistance. However, the use of clofazimine in tuberculosis treatment is hampered by its high lipophilicity and skin pigmentation side effects. To identify a new generation of riminophenazines that is less lipophilic and skin staining, while maintaining efficacy, we have performed a systematic structure-activity relationship (SAR) investigation by synthesizing a variety of analogs of clofazimine and evaluating their anti-tuberculosis activity. The study reveals that the central tricyclic phenazine system and the pendant aromatic rings are important for anti-tuberculosis activity. However, the phenyl groups attached to the C2 and N5 position of clofazimine can be replaced by a pyridyl group to provide analogs with improved physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetic characteristics. Replacement of the phenyl group attached to the C2 position by a pyridyl group has led to a promising new series of compounds with improved physicochemical properties, improved anti-tuberculosis potency, and reduced pigmentation potential.	anti-tuberculosis; MDR-TB; riminophenazine; clofazimine; skin pigmentation	CLOFAZIMINE; ANALOGS
10.1016_j.meegid.2012.02.002	Genetic diversity, population structure and drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Peru	"This paper presents the first evaluation of the molecular epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Peru. We characterised 323 isolates using spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units variable number tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) typing. We aimed to determine the levels of genetic diversity and genetic differentiation among and within Peruvian isolates and the epidemiological factors which may be driving patterns of population structure and evolution of M. tuberculosis in Peru. Our results compared to the fourth international spoligotyping database (SpolDB4) and MIRU-VNTRplus, show that the main M. tuberculosis families present are Latin American-Mediterranean, Haarlem, T, and Beijing. Bayesian clustering recovered 15 groups in the Peruvian M. tuberculosis isolates, among which two were composed mainly of orphans, implying the presence of native ""Peruvian"" strains not previously reported. Variable levels of association with drug resistance were observed, with Beijing genotypes not showing any association with multidrug resistance, while in other groups MIRU-VNTR loci 2, 23, 31, and 40 were found to be associated with the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) phenotype, suggesting that a linkage disequibrium between these MIRU and drug resistance loci may be present. Genetic differentiation was present among drug resistant and sensitive strains. Ethambutol appeared to be the main driver of differentiation, suggesting that strong selection pressure could have been exerted by drug treatment in Peru over recent years. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

10.5588_ijtld.11.0615	High rate of hypothyroidism among patients treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Lesotho	BACKGROUND: Hypothyroidism is a known side effect of treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), but it is considered to be rare. Hypothyroidism has vague and non-specific symptoms, and can be easily missed by clinicians. OBJECTIVE: To report the high rate of hypothyroidism in a cohort of MDR-TB patients in Lesotho and to describe our approach to diagnosis and management. DESIGN: A retrospective study of 212 patients who initiated treatment for MDR-TB in Lesotho between 27 July 2007 and 24 March 2009 was performed. RESULTS: Among 186 patients screened, 129 (69%) had hypothyroidism, defined as at least one documented thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) result > 10.0 mIU/l; 100 (54%) patients had a maximum TSH > 20.0 mIU/l. At 93 days after starting MDR-TB treatment, half of the patients had developed hypothyroidism. CONCLUSION: Hypothyroidism may be more common during MDR-TB treatment than previously recognized. Screening all patients, even those without symptoms, for hypothyroidism within 2-3 months of starting MDR-TB treatment should be considered until prospective studies can inform screening guidelines.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; adverse reactions; thyroid	NONTHYROIDAL ILLNESS SYNDROME; URINARY IODINE; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; RECEIVING TREATMENT; MDR-TB; ETHIONAMIDE; THYROTROPIN; PREVALENCE; THERAPY
10.5588_ijtld.11.0269	Evaluation of the GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay and identification of a rare mutation for improving MDR-TB detection	OBJECTIVE: To assess the new GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay for the rapid detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in comparison with DNA sequencing to identify drug resistance mutation profiles in China. DESIGN: Using MTBDRplus, drug susceptibility testing (DST) and DNA sequencing, 237 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains were tested. RESULTS: The sensitivity of MTBDRplus was 75.0% (126/168) for isoniazid (INH) resistant strains, and 93.5% (157/168) for rifampicin (RMP) resistant strains. It correlated well with sequencing, with 94.9% and 99.6% agreement for each strain category and 100% specificity for all categories. The two most common rpoB mutations were S531L (53.6%, 90/168) and D516G (17.3%, 29/168) in RMP-resistant strains. INH resistance was dominated by the katG 315 locus (S to T, N, R, I) mutation (73.7%, 124/168), and a rare katG mutation, S315N (6.5%, 11/168), not covered by MTBDRplus was identified. The mutation combination inhA-15/inhA-8 and katG315 (34 strains) was characteristically displayed in MDR-TB strains (23.5%), but not in INH-monoresistant strains. CONCLUSIONS: Although Genotype MTBDRplus is a rapid and reliable molecular test for detecting MDR-TB, a significant proportion of strains in China contain a rare katG S315N mutation that would be missed by the assay. Further improvements may be achieved by incorporating this mutation into the assay to increase sensitivity in detecting INH resistance in China.

10.1183_09031936.00203811	European Union Standards for Tuberculosis Care	The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) jointly developed European Union Standards for Tuberculosis Care (ESTC) aimed at providing European Union (EU)-tailored standards for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of tuberculosis (TB). The International Standards for TB Care (ISTC) were developed in the global context and are not always adapted to the EU setting and practices. The majority of EU countries have the resources and capacity to implement higher standards to further secure quality TB diagnosis, treatment and prevention. On this basis, the ESTC were developed as standards specifically tailored to the EU setting. A panel of 30 international experts, led by a writing group and the ERS and ECDC, identified and developed the 21 ESTC in the areas of diagnosis, treatment, HIV and comorbid conditions, and public health and prevention. The ISTCs formed the basis for the 21 standards, upon which additional EU adaptations and supplements were developed. These patient-centred standards are targeted to clinicians and public health workers, providing an easy-to-use resource, guiding through all required activities to ensure optimal diagnosis, treatment and prevention of TB. These will support EU health programmes to identify and develop optimal procedures for TB care, control and elimination.

10.1183_09031936.00076811	Linezolid: an effective, safe and cheap drug for patients failing multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment in India	Linezolid is identified as an effective drug with which to treat patients failing multidrug-resistant (MDR)-tuberculosis (TB) treatment. However, cost and safety are the concerns. In India, the average price of a 600-mg pill of linezolid is less than one US dollar, much cheaper than most of the third-line drugs. A prospective study of 29 MDR-TB treatment failure patients (16 with laboratory-proven extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB and the remaining 13 with MDR-TB with resistance to any quinolone but sensitive to injectables) was carried out in Delhi, India. All patients received daily unsupervised therapy with linezolid, one injectable agent, one fluoroquinolone and two or more other drugs. Patients received a median of six anti-mycobacterial agents. Besides linezolid, capreomycin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin and amoxycillin-clavulanic acid were used in 41.4%, 58.6%, 41.4%, and 79.3% of patients. Out of a total of 29 patients, 89.7% patients achieved sputum smear and culture conversion; 72.4% showed interim favourable outcome; 10.3% died, 6.8% failed and 10.3% patients defaulted. Linezolid had to be stopped in three (10.3%) patients due to adverse reactions. The outcome of treatment of 16 XDR-TB patients was comparable to the other 13 MDR-TB patients. Linezolid is an effective, cheap and relatively safe drug for patients failing MDR-TB treatment, including those with confirmed XDR-TB.

10.1016_j.ijid.2011.12.015	Characterizing Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Karachi, Pakistan: drug resistance and genotypes	Objectives: To study the prevalence, risk factors, and genotypes of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Karachi. Methods: Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients were recruited in a cross-sectional study (2006-2009). Drug susceptibility testing was performed for culture-positive cases (n = 1004). Factors associated with drug resistance were evaluated using logistic regression analysis. Strains were typed using spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR). The associations of genotype and drug resistance were explored using the Chi-square test. Results: Resistance rates - new and previously treated - were as follows: multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB, 2.4% and 13.9%, respectively; rifampin (RIF) monoresistance, 0.1% and 0.6%, respectively; any isoniazid (INH) resistance, 8.9% and 28.5%, respectively; and INH monoresistance, 3.0% and 6.3%, respectively. Prior TB treatment was a risk factor for MDR-TB (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 6.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.5-13.1) and INH monoresistance (AOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.2). Additional risk factors included low socioeconomic status for INH monoresistance (AOR 3.3, 95% CI 1.7-6.5), and belonging to Balouchi (AOR 9.2, 95% CI 2.5-33.4), Sindhi (AOR 4.1, 95% CI 1.2-13.5), or Pakhtun (AOR 3.4, 95% CI 1.0-11.2) ethnicity for MDR-TB. Although Central Asian strain (55.6%) was the most prevalent genotype, MDR-TB was significantly associated with Haarlem (H) genogroup (crude OR 9.2, 95% CI 3.6-23.8). Conclusions: An MDR-TB rate of 2.4% is reported in new patients. Low RIF monoresistance supports the use of RIF as a marker for MDR-TB in this population. The need to strengthen TB care in the identified at-risk groups is emphasized. Based on INH resistance rates, a review of national treatment/prevention regimens relying on INH is suggested.

Herein we report ten classes of compounds-oxazoline, oxazole, thiazoline, thiazole, pyrazole, pyridine, isoxazole,imidazo[1,2-a] pyridine, imidazo[1,2-a] pyrimidine and imidazo[1,2-c] pyrimidine-which have good (micromolar) to excellent (sub-micromolar) antitubercular potency. The 5,6-fused heteroaromatic compounds were the most potent with MIC's as low as < 0.195 mu M (9 and 11). Overall, the imidazo[1,2-a] pyridine class was determined to be most promising, with potency similar to isoniazid and PA-824 against replicating Mtb H(37)Rv, clinically relevant drug sensitive, multi-and extensively resistant Mtb strains as well as having good in vitro metabolic stability.

10.3201_eid1804.110912	Drug Susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing Genotype and Association with MDR TB	To determine differences in the ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains to withstand antituberculosis drug treatment, we compared the activity of antituberculosis drugs against susceptible Beijing and East-African/Indian genotype M. tuberculosis strains. Beijing genotype strains showed high rates of mutation within a wide range of drug concentrations, possibly explaining this genotype's association with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

10.3791_3547	Diagnosing Pulmonary Tuberculosis with the Xpert MTB/RIF Test	Tuberculosis (TB) due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) remains a major public health issue: the infection affects up to one third of the world population(1), and almost two million people are killed by TB each year.(2) Universal access to high-quality, patient-centered treatment for all TB patients is emphasized by WHO's Stop TB Strategy.(3) The rapid detection of MTB in respiratory specimens and drug therapy based on reliable drug resistance testing results are a prerequisite for the successful implementation of this strategy. However, in many areas of the world, TB diagnosis still relies on insensitive, poorly standardized sputum microscopy methods. Ineffective TB detection and the emergence and transmission of drug-resistant MTB strains increasingly jeopardize global TB control activities.(2) Effective diagnosis of pulmonary TB requires the availability - on a global scale - of standardized, easy-to-use, and robust diagnostic tools that would allow the direct detection of both the MTB complex and resistance to key antibiotics, such as rifampicin (RIF). The latter result can serve as marker for multidrug-resistant MTB (MDR TB) and has been reported in > 95% of the MDR-TB isolates.(4, 5) The rapid availability of reliable test results is likely to directly translate into sound patient management decisions that, ultimately, will cure the individual patient and break the chain of TB transmission in the community.(2) Cepheid's (Sunnyvale, CA, U.S.A.) Xpert MTB/RIF assay(6, 7) meets the demands outlined above in a remarkable manner. It is a nucleic-acids amplification test for 1) the detection of MTB complex DNA in sputum or concentrated sputum sediments; and 2) the detection of RIF resistance-associated mutations of the rpoB gene.(8) It is designed for use with Cepheid's GeneXpert Dx System that integrates and automates sample processing, nucleic acid amplification, and detection of the target sequences using real-time PCR and reverse transcriptase PCR. The system consists of an instrument, personal computer, barcode scanner, and preloaded software for running tests and viewing the results.(9) It employs single-use disposable Xpert MTB/RIF cartridges that hold PCR reagents and host the PCR process. Because the cartridges are self-contained, cross-contamination between samples is eliminated.(6) Current nucleic acid amplification methods used to detect MTB are complex, labor-intensive, and technically demanding. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay has the potential to bring standardized, sensitive and very specific diagnostic testing for both TB and drug resistance to universal-access point-of-care settings(3), provided that they will be able to afford it. In order to facilitate access, the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) has negotiated significant price reductions. Current FIND-negotiated prices, along with the list of countries eligible for the discounts, are available on the web.(10)	Immunology; Issue 62; tuberculosis; drug resistance; rifampicin; rapid diagnosis; Xpert MTB/RIF test	
10.1371_journal.pone.0033507	Estimating Fitness by Competition Assays between Drug Susceptible and Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis of Predominant Lineages in Mumbai, India	Background: Multi Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR TB) is a threat to global tuberculosis control. A significant fitness cost has been associated with DR strains from specific lineages. Evaluation of the influence of the competing drug susceptible strains on fitness of drug resistant strains may have an important bearing on understanding the spread of MDR TB. The aim of this study was to evaluate the fitness of MDR TB strains, from a TB endemic region of western India: Mumbai, belonging to 3 predominant lineages namely CAS, Beijing and MANU in the presence of drug susceptible strains from the same lineages. Methodology: Drug susceptible strains from a single lineage were mixed with drug resistant strain, bearing particular non synonymous mutation (rpoB D516V; inhA, A16G; katG, S315T1/T2) from the same or different lineages. Fitness of M. tuberculosis (M.tb) strains was evaluated using the difference in growth rates obtained by using the CFU assay system. Conclusion/Significance: While MANU were most fit amongst the drug susceptible strains of the 3 lineages, only Beijing MDR strains were found to grow in the presence of any of the competing drug susceptible strains. A disproportionate increase in Beijing MDR could be an alarm for an impending epidemic in this locale. In addition to particular non synonymous substitutions, the competing strains in an environment may impact the fitness of circulating drug resistant strains.

10.1371_journal.pone.0033129	Outcomes of TB Treatment by HIV Status in National Recording Systems in Brazil, 2003-2008	Background: Although the Brazilian national reporting system for tuberculosis cases (SINAN) has enormous potential to generate data for policy makers, formal assessments of treatment outcomes and other aspects of TB morbidity and mortality are not produced with enough depth and rigor. In particular, the effect of HIV status on these outcomes has not been fully explored, partly due to incomplete recording in the national database. Methodology/Principal Findings: In a retrospective cohort study, we assessed TB treatment outcomes, including rates of cure, default, mortality, transfer and multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) among a purposively chosen sample of 161,481 new cases reported in SINAN between 2003 and 2008. The study population included all new cases reported in the six States with the highest level of completeness of the HIV status field in the system. These cases were mostly male (67%), white (62%), had pulmonary TB (79%) and a suspect chest X ray (83%). Treatment outcomes were best for those HIV negative cases and worst for those known HIV positive patients (cure rate of 85.7% and 55.7% respectively). In multivariate modeling, the risk of having an unfavorable outcome (all outcomes except cure) was 3.09 times higher for those HIV positive compared with those HIV negative (95% CI 3.02-3.16). The risk of death and default also increased with HIV positivity. The group without a known HIV status showed intermediate outcomes between the groups above, suggesting that this group includes some with HIV infection. Conclusions: HIV status played an important role in TB treatment outcomes in the study period. The outcomes observed in those with known HIV were poor and need to be improved. Those in the group with unknown HIV status indicate the need for wider HIV testing among new TB cases.

pub-1217	Thioridazine: an Old Neuroleptic effective against Totally Drug Resistant Tuberculosis	Globally, tuberculosis infections continue to increase their resistance to antibiotics. Multidrug resistant tuberculosis infections (MDR TB) have progressed to extensively drug resistance status (XDR TB) and the latter have evolved in some parts of the world to totally drug resistant (TDR TB) infections. MDR TB is difficult to treat successfully, and when therapy is ineffective, a single case can cost almost $500,000. When the infection is XDR TB therapy is mostly unsuccessful and is accompanied with high mortality. TDR TB-a yet to be defined infection, is resistant to all forms of therapy and mortality is almost certain. We have, over a period of 14 years, studied thioridazine (TZ) an old neuroleptic that we have shown to: i) have in vitro activity against all antibiotic resistant forms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis; ii) have activity against intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis regardless of its antibiotic resistance status; iii) cure the infected mouse of an antibiotic susceptible and MDR TB infections; and, iv) when used in combination with antibiotics used for therapy of tuberculosis, would render the organism significantly more susceptible. These studies have guided our Argentinian colleagues to treat successfully XDR TB infections with thioridazine in combination with three antibiotics to which the infection was initially resistant. This mini review will describe our further work and the mechanisms by which TZ alone and in combination with antibiotics cures an XDR TB infection and why it is expected to cure TDR TB infections as well. The concepts presented are totally new and because they focus on the activation of killing by non-killing macrophages where Mycobacterium tuberculosis normally resides during infection, and coupled to the inhibition of efflux pumps which contribute to the antibiotic resistant status, effective therapy of any antibiotic resistant TB infection is possible. Because TZ is cheap and therefore affordable to any economically disadvantaged country, and will produce no harm when appropriate measures are taken, it is the ideal drug for immediate use in countries that have high frequencies of MDR, XDR and TDR TB infections.

10.1177_147323001204000205	Social Behaviour Risk Factors for Drug Resistant Tuberculosis in Mainland China: a Meta-analysis	OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors associated with drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) in mainland China. METHODS: PubMed and Chinese BioMedical databases were searched. Cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies providing effect estimates of risk factors for any-drug resistant or multidrug resistant (MDR) TB were included. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 16 studies. Any-drug resistant TB was significantly associated with poor quality directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) (odds ratio [OR] 2.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22, 5.79), long term illness > 1 year (OR 2.71, 95% Cl 1.34, 5.48), poor treatment adherence (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.17, 3.40), previous treatment (OR 4.54, 95% CI 2.71, 7.61) and age 40 - 60 years (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.10, 2.38). MDR-TB was significantly associated with poor quality DOTS (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.36, 2.49), poor treatment adherence (OR 4.39, 95% CI 2.97, 6.50), previous treatment (OR 3.83, 95% CI 2.12, 6.89) and poverty (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.38, 2.52). CONCLUSIONS: Previous treatment, poor quality DOTS, poor treatment adherence, long term illness, age 40 - 60 years and poverty are associated with a greater risk of drug resistant TB in mainland China.

10.1186_1471_2334_12_49	Evaluation of microscopic observation drug susceptibility assay for diagnosis of multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis in Viet Nam	Background: Early diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) is important for the elimination of TB. We evaluated the microscopic observation drug susceptibility (MODS) assay as a direct rapid drug susceptibility testing (DST) method for MDR-TB screening in sputum samples Methods: All adult TB suspects, who were newly presenting to Pham Ngoc Thach Hospital from August to November 2008 were enrolled into the study. Processed sputum samples were used for DST by MODS (DST-MODS) (Rifampicin (RIF) 1 mu g/ml and Isoniazid (INH) 0.4 mu g/ml), MGIT culture (Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube) and Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) culture. Cultures positive by either MGIT or LJ were used for proportional DST (DST-LJ) (RIF 40 mu g/ml and INH 0.2 mu g/ml). DST profiles on MODS and LJ were compared. Discrepant results were resolved by multiplex allele specific PCR (MAS-PCR). Results: Seven hundred and nine TB suspects/samples were enrolled into the study, of which 300 samples with DST profiles available from both MODS and DST-LJ were analyzed. Cording in MODS was unable to correctly identify 3 Mycobacteria Other Than Tuberculosis (MOTT) isolates, resulting in 3 false positive TB diagnoses. None of these isolates were identified as MDR-TB by MODS. The sensitivity and specificity of MODS were 72.6% (95%CI: 59.8, 83.1) and 97.9% (95%CI: 95.2, 99.3), respectively for detection of INH resistant isolates, 72.7% (95%CI: 30.9, 93.7) and 99.7% (95%CI: 98.1, 99.9), respectively for detecting RIF resistant isolates and 77.8% (95%CI: 39.9, 97.1) and 99.7% (95%CI: 98.1, 99.9), respectively for detecting MDR isolates. The positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) of DST-MODS were 87.5% (95%CI: 47.3, 99.6) and 99.3% (95%CI: 97.5, 99.9) for detection of MDR isolates; and the agreement between MODS and DST-LJ was 99.0% (kappa: 0.8, P < 0.001) for MDR diagnosis. The low sensitivity of MODS for drug resistance detection was probably due to low bacterial load samples and the high INH concentration (0.4 mu g/ml). The low PPV of DST-MODS may be due to the low MDR-TB rate in the study population (3.8%). The turnaround time of DST-MODS was 9 days and 53 days for DST-LJ. Conclusion: The DST-MODS technique is rapid with low contamination rates. However, the sensitivity of DST-MODS for detection of INH and RIF resistance in this study was lower than reported from other settings.

pub-1220	Characterization of gyrA and gyrB mutations and fluoroquinolone resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from Hubei Province, China	Objective: The study aimed to investigate gyrA and gyrB mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) clinical strains from 93 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in Hubei Province, China, and analyze the association between mutation patterns of the genes and ofloxacin resistance level. Results: Among 93 MTB clinical isolates, 61 were ofloxacin-resistant by the proportion method, and 32 were ofloxacin-susceptible MDR-TB. No mutation in the gyrB gene was found in any MTB strains. In the 61 ofloxacin-resistant isolates, 54 mutations were observed in the gyrA gene. Only one mutation in the gyrA gene was found in ofloxacin-susceptible MDR-TB isolates. In this study, the mutation patterns of gyrA involved seven patterns of single codon mutation (A90V, S91P, S91T, D94N, D94Y, D94G or D94A) and two patterns of double codons mutation (S91P & D94H, S91P & D94A). The ofloxacin minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of three patterns of single codon mutations in the gyrA gene (codons 94, 90 and 91) showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: The gyrA mutations at codons 90, 91 and 94 constitute the primary mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance in MTB, and mutations at codon 91 in the gyrA gene may be associated with low-level resistance to ofloxacin.

10.1590_S1413_86702012000200006	Previous use of quinolones: a surrogate marker for first line anti-tuberculosis drugs resistance in HIV-infected patients?	Objectives: Drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes much higher rates of treatment toxicity, failure or relapse, and mortality. We determined the drug resistant profile of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated from a population of HIV-infected patients in southern Brazil and studied the potential factors associated with resistance. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to determine the resistance profile of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from HIV-infected patients and factors that could be associated with resistance from 2000 to 2005. Results: 236 patients were included in the study. Resistance to at least one drug was observed in 32 (14.6%) isolates, and multi-drug resistance was observed in 4 (1.82%) isolates. On multivariate analysis, previous use of tuberculostatics and quinolones were related to any first-line drug resistance. Conclusions: In our study, previous quinolone use was significantly associated to first-line anti-TB drugs resistance. Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major problem worldwide, and we believe quinolones should be used with caution in settings where TB is endemic. (C) 2012 Elsevier Editora Ltda.

pub-1222	PREVALENCE OF DRUG RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS AMONG PATIENTS AT HIGH-RISK FOR HIV ATTENDING OUTPATIENT CLINICS IN DELHI, INDIA	We sought to determine tuberculosis (TB) prevalence including multidrug resistant (MDR)-TB among a cohort of high risk patients at two directly observed treatment short course (DOTS) clinics in Delhi, India. We also aimed to compare the sensitivity of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear tests for patients with HIV using sputum cultures as the gold standard. A cross-section study was conducted among adult patients (>= 18 years old) with prolonged cough (greater than two weeks), night sweats, fever, and/or weight loss suspected of pulmonary TB between February and March 2006. Sputum samples were obtained and processed for 165 patients; 53 (32.1%) were culture positive for TB. Patients with TB were predominantly male (92.1%), young (median age of 32 years), and the HIV-seroprevalence was high (41.5%). In the multivariable analysis adjusted for age, HIV infection was significantly associated (POR=2.0, p<0.05) with the presence of TB disease. Among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates recovered from 53 cases, 25 (47.2%) were resistant to >= 1 first line anti-TB drugs and 7 (13.2%) were MDR-TB. The sensitivity of AFB smears among HIV negative and positive participants was 35.5% and 18.0%, respectively. Our findings demonstrated that the sensitivity of AFB smears to detect TB among HIV positive patients was low. Additionally, we found that even in regions where population drug resistance estimates are low, sentinel surveillance of MDR-TB in high-risk populations is useful to prioritize target groups in need of additional prevention, monitoring and health outreach.	tuberculosis; multidrug resistance; HIV; DOTS	SOUTH-INDIA; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; SURVEILLANCE; PROGRAMS; PATTERN; STATE
10.1038_ncomms1724	Isoniazid resistance without a loss of fitness in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	The emergence of multi- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB and XDR-TB, respectively) has intensified the critical public health implications of this global disease. The fitness of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb.) strains exhibiting MDR and XDR phenotypes is of fundamental importance in predicting whether the MDR-/XDR-TB epidemic will be sustained across the human population. Here we describe a potential mechanism of M.tb. resistance to the TB drug isoniazid (INH) conferred by loss of a sigma factor, SigI. We demonstrate that the gain of INH resistance in the M.tb. Delta sigI mutant might not diminish the organism's fitness for causing disease. These findings have significant implications when considering the ability of drug-resistant M.tb. strains to initiate untreatable TB epidemics, as it is possible that loss or alteration of SigI function could have a role in the generation of MDR and XDR M.tb. strains of suitable fitness to spread in a community setting.

10.1111_j.1365_3156.2011.02933.x	Increasing access to the MDR-TB surveillance programme through a collaborative model in western Kenya*	Objective Kenya, like many resource-constrained countries, has a single mycobacterial laboratory, centrally located in Nairobi, with capacity for drug-susceptibility testing (DST) the gold standard in diagnosing drug-resistant tuberculosis. We describe and evaluate a novel operational design that attempts to overcome diagnostic delivery barriers. methods Review of the public DST programme identified several barriers limiting access: lack of programme awareness amongst physicians, limited supplies, unreliable transport and no specimen tracking methods. Staff visited 19 clinic sites in western Kenya and trained healthcare providers in regard to the novel diagnostics model. Provincial laboratory registries were reviewed to assess utilization of DST services prior to and after programme modification. results Onsite training consisted of the inclusion criteria for re-treatment patients -the high-priority group for DST. Additionally, infrastructural support established a stable supply chain. An existing transport system was adapted to deliver sputum specimens. Task shifting created an accession and tracking system of specimens. During the 24 months post-implementation, the number of re-treatment specimens from the catchment area increased from 9.1 to 23.5 specimens per month. In comparing annual data pre-and post-implementation, the proportion of re-treatment cases receiving DST increased from 24.7% (n = 403) to 32.5% (n = 574) (P < 0.001), and the number of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB cases increased from 5 to 10 cases. conclusion The delivery model significantly increased the proportion of re-treatment cases receiving DST. Barriers to accessing the national MDR-TB surveillance programme can be overcome through an operational model based on pragmatic use of existing services from multiple partners.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; microbial sensitivity tests; Kenya; delivery of health care	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; DIAGNOSIS; PERU
10.4103_0019_5413.93685	Tuberculosis spine: Therapeutically refractory disease	Background: India ranks second amongst the high-burden multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) countries, with an estimated incidence of 2.3 MDR-TB cases amongst the new cases and 17.2 amongst the previously treated cases. The diagnosis and treatment protocol for MDR-TB of the spine are not clearly established. We report outcome of a series of 15 cases of TB spine who were suspected to be therapeutically refractory cases (MDR-TB) on the basis of clinicoradiological failures of initial treatment. Materials and Methods: Fifteen cases of TB spine from C2 to L5 spine were suspected to be the cases of MDR-TB (therapeutically refractory cases) on the basis of failures of adequate clinicoradiological healing response at 5 months or more on antitubercular treatment (ATT). None of the patient was immunocompromised. Thirteen out of 15 patients had tissue samples sent for histopathology, culture and sensitivity, smear, BACTEC, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All patients were put on second line ATT and followed up fortnightly with regular liver and kidney function tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and plain X-ray. Healing was documented as subjective improvement of symptoms, reduction in ESR, and observations on contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) such as resolution of marrow edema, fatty replacement of bone marrow and resolution of abscesses. Ambiguous MRI observations in a few patients were resolved on positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Patients were monitored continuously for 2 years after stopping ATT. Results: We could demonstrate a positive culture in three cases. Two of them had multi drug resistance. We could achieve healing status in 13 out of 14 patients after starting second line drugs, one patient is still on treatment while other patient with no drug resistance is responding well on ATT. Conclusions: The suspicion of therapeutically refractory case is of paramount importance. Once suspected, surgery to procure tissue for diagnosis and culture is to be undertaken. The demonstration of drug resistance on culture may not be achieved in all TB spine cases and empiric drug regimen for MDR-TB is to be started. We have achieved the healed status with immunomodulation and second line ATT. The length of treatment needs to be monitored with MRI and PET scan.

10.1186_1477_5956_10_14	Analysis of intracellular expressed proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates	Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is the most threatening infectious disease globally. Although progress has been made to reduce global incidence of TB, emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) TB threatens to undermine these advances. To combat the disease, novel intervention strategies effective against drug resistant and sensitive subpopulations of M. tuberculosis are urgently required as adducts in the present treatment regimen. Using THP-1 cells we have analyzed and compared the global protein expression profile of broth-cultured and intraphagosomally grown drug resistant and sensitive M. tuberculosis clinical isolates. Results: On comparing the two dimensional (2-DE) gels, many proteins were found to be upregulated/expressed during intracellular state which were identified by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Four proteins (adenosylhomocysteinase, aspartate carbomyltransferase, putatitive thiosulfate sulfurtransferase and universal stress protein) were present in both intracellular MDR and sensitive isolates and three of these belonged to intermediary metabolism and respiration category. Two proteins (alanine dehydrogenase and adenosine kinase) of intracellular MDR isolate and two (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and ATP synthase epsilon chain) of intracellular sensitive isolate belonged to intermediary metabolism and respiration category. One protein (Peroxidase/Catalase) of intracellular MDR and three (HSPX, 14 kDa antigen and 10 kDa chaperonin) of sensitive isolate belonged to virulence, detoxification and adaptation category. ESAT-6 of intracellular MDR belonged to cell wall and cell processes category. Two proteins (Antigen 85-C and Antigen 85-A) of intracellular sensitive isolate were involved in lipid metabolism while probable peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A was involved in information pathways. Four (Rv0635, Rv1827, Rv0036c and Rv2032) of intracellular MDR and two proteins (Rv2896c and Rv2558c) of sensitive isolate were hypothetical proteins which were functionally characterized using bioinformatic tools. Bioinformatic findings revealed that the proteins encoded by Rv0036, Rv2032c, Rv0635, Rv1827 and Rv2896c genes are involved in cellular metabolism and help in intracellular survival. Conclusions: Mass spectrometry and bioinformatic analysis of both MDR and sensitive isolates of M. tuberculosis during intraphagosomal growth showed that majority of commonly upregulated/expressed proteins belonged to the cellular metabolism and respiration category. Inhibitors of the metabolic enzymes/intermediate can therefore serve as suitable drug targets against drug-resistant and sensitive subpopulations of M. tuberculosis.

10.5588_ijtld.11.0473	HIV-positive patients treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: clinical outcomes in the HAART era	SETTING: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pose two of the greatest threats to global tuberculosis (TB) control. Given expanding global access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and second-line TB drugs, more data are needed on experiences treating MDR-TB and HIV co-infection in resource-poor settings. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics, management, outcomes, and factors associated with survival among HIV-positive individuals receiving treatment for MDR-TB. DESIGN: This was a retrospective case series of 52 HIV-positive individuals receiving treatment for MDR-TB in Lima, Peru. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to identify risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: A total of 31 (57%) of the cohort died on treatment, with the majority of deaths due to MDR-TB. Low baseline weight predicted a three-fold increased rate of death (aHR 3.1, 95%CI 1.5-6.7), while individuals receiving highly active ART experienced a significantly lower rate of death compared to those who were not (aHR 0.4, 95 %CI 0.2-0.9). CONCLUSION: Early ART is likely a key component of effective MDR-TB management in co-infected individuals.

10.5588_ijtld.11.0493	Linezolid in the treatment of MDR-TB: a retrospective clinical study	BACKGROUND: There is limited information on Chinese patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treated with a linezolid-containing regimen. OBJECTIVE: To examine treatment outcomes among MDR-TB patients who were treated with linezolid at the Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, China. DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed 151 patients who were treated for MDR-TB from 2007 to 2010. RESULTS: Eighteen MDR-TB patients, including 15 with extensively drug-resistant TB, received linezolid as part of their individualised treatment regimens. Patients had isolates resistant to a median of 7 drugs (range 5-11). Of the 18 cases, 17 had cavitary changes and positive sputum smear microscopy results at the time of MDR-TB diagnosis. Culture conversion occurred in all cases at a median of 7 weeks. At data censure, 9 of the 18 patients had achieved treatment success. Three continued to receive treatment. There were no deaths. Six patients had a poor outcome, including 1 default, 2 treatment failures and 3 relapses. Side effects occurred in 17 patients, including myelosuppression, neurotoxicity and gastrointestinal adverse events. Adverse events were managed by combinations of temporary suspension of linezolid in 1 patient, dose adjustment in 17 patients and symptom management in 13 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid may have efficacy in the treatment of MDR-TB, although treatment was complicated by adverse events.	linezolid; multidrug-resistant; tuberculosis; treatment outcomes	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; OPTIC NEUROPATHY; TOLERABILITY; SAFETY; EFFICACY; OXAZOLIDINONES; PREVENTION; THERAPY
10.5588_ijtld.11.0511	Concordance of programmatic and laboratory-based multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment outcomes in Peru	BACKGROUND: Confirmation of cure for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients requires laboratory tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth on culture media. Outcome decisions dictate patient management, and inaccuracies place patients at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, and may contribute to continued transmission of MDR-TB. OBJECTIVE: To examine concordance between programmatic and laboratory-based MDR-TB treatment outcomes. METHODS: The study population included 1658 MDR-TB patients in Peru treated between 1996 and 2002 with both program and laboratory-based outcomes. Laboratory-based outcomes were assigned according to international standards requiring at least five consecutive negative cultures in the last 12 months of treatment to confirm cure. RESULTS: Compared to the global culture-defined standard classification, only 1.1% of treatment successes, but 54.3% of failures, were misclassified programmatically. Overall, 10.4% of patients identified by a clinician as having a successful treatment outcome still had cultures positive for MDR-TB. CONCLUSION: Most patients with successful treatment outcomes by strict culture definitions were also classified by clinicians as having successful outcomes. However, many culture-confirmed failures were missed. In light of delays and incomplete access to culture in MDR-TB programs, efforts should be made to improve the accuracy of programmatically determined treatment outcomes.	drug-resistant TB; program factors; cross-validation; bacteriologic outcomes; clinical judgment	
10.1128_JCM.05832_11	Population Structure of Multi- and Extensively Drug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Strains in South Africa	Genotyping of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated from tuberculosis ( TB) patients in four South African provinces (Western Cape, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, and Gauteng) revealed a distinct population structure of the MDR strains in all four regions, despite the evidence of substantial human migration between these settings. In all analyzed provinces, a negative correlation between strain diversity and an increasing level of drug resistance ( from MDR-TB to extensively drug-resistant TB [XDR-TB]) was observed. Strains predominating in XDR-TB in the Western and Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal Provinces were strongly associated with harboring an inhA promoter mutation, potentially suggesting a role of these mutations in XDR-TB development in South Africa. Approximately 50% of XDR-TB cases detected in the Western Cape were due to strains probably originating from the Eastern Cape. This situation may illustrate how failure of efficient health care delivery in one setting can burden health clinics in other areas.

In spite of the growing awareness of emerging drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the extent of inappropriate tuberculosis (TB) case management may be underestimated, even in Europe. We evaluated TB case management in the European Union/European Economic Area countries, with special focus on multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB, using a purposely developed, standardised survey tool. National reference centres in five countries representing different geographical, socioeconomic and epidemiological patterns of TB in Europe were surveyed. 40 consecutive, original clinical TB case records (30 MDR/XDR-TB cases) were reviewed in each of the five countries. The findings were recorded and, through the survey tool, compared with previously agreed and identified international standards. Deviations from international standards of TB care were observed in the following areas: surveillance (no information available on patient outcomes); infection control (lack of respiratory isolation rooms/procedures and negative-pressure ventilation rooms); clinical management of TB, MDR-TB and HIV co-infection (inadequate bacteriological diagnosis, regimen selection and treatment duration); laboratory support; and diagnostic/treatment algorithms. Gaps between present international standards of care and the management of MDR/XDR-TB patients were identified. Training, increased awareness, promotion of standards and allocation of appropriate resources are necessary to ensure appropriate care and management as well as to prevent further emergence of drug resistance.

10.1097_EDE.0b013e3182459455	Multidrug Resistance Among New Tuberculosis Cases Detecting Local Variation Through Lot Quality-assurance Sampling	Background: Current methodology for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) surveys endorsed by the World Health Organization provides estimates of MDR TB prevalence among new cases at the national level. On the aggregate, local variation in the burden of MDR TB may be masked. This paper investigates the utility of applying lot quality-assurance sampling to identify geographic heterogeneity in the proportion of new cases with multidrug resistance. Methods: We simulated the performance of lot quality-assurance sampling by applying these classification-based approaches to data collected in the most recent TB drug-resistance surveys in Ukraine, Vietnam, and Tanzania. We explored 3 classification systems-two-way static, three-way static, and three-way truncated sequential sampling-at 2 sets of thresholds: low MDR TB = 2%, high MDR TB = 10%, and low MDR TB = 5%, high MDR TB = 20%. Results: The lot quality-assurance sampling systems identified local variability in the prevalence of multidrug resistance in both high-resistance (Ukraine) and low-resistance settings (Vietnam). In Tanzania, prevalence was uniformly low, and the lot quality-assurance sampling approach did not reveal variability. The three-way classification systems provide additional information, but sample sizes may not be obtainable in some settings. New rapid drug-sensitivity testing methods may allow truncated sequential sampling designs and early stopping within static designs, producing even greater efficiency gains. Conclusions: Lot quality-assurance sampling study designs may offer an efficient approach for collecting critical information on local variability in the burden of multidrug-resistant TB. Before this methodology is adopted, programs must determine appropriate classification thresholds, the most useful classification system, and appropriate weighting if unbiased national estimates are also desired.

10.3109_03639045.2011.598535	Antimycobacterial activity of 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethanone, a synthetic analogue of neolignan, entrapped in polymeric microparticles	Conventional treatment of tuberculosis (TB) demands a long course therapy (6 months), known to originate multiple drug resistant strains (MDR-TB), which emphasizes the urgent need for new antituberculous drugs. The purpose of this study was to investigate a novel treatment for TB meant to improve patient compliance by reducing drug dosage frequency. Polymeric microparticles containing the synthetic analogue of neolignan, 1-phenyl-2-phenoxiethanone (LS-2), were obtained by a method of emulsification and solvent evaporation and chemically characterized. Only representative LS-2-loaded microparticles were considered for further studies involving experimental murine TB induced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv ATCC 27294. The LS-2-loaded microparticles were spherical in shape, had a smooth wall and showed an encapsulation efficiency of 93% in addition to displaying sustained release. Chemotherapeutic potential of LS-2 entrapped in microparticles was comparable to control groups. These findings are encouraging and indicate that LS-2-loaded microparticles are a potential alternative to conventional chemotherapy of TB.

10.1371_journal.pone.0031531	Effective Interventions and Decline of Antituberculosis Drug Resistance in Eastern Taiwan, 2004-2008	Background: The Taiwan health authority recently launched several tuberculosis (TB) control interventions, which may have an impact on the epidemic of drug-resistant TB. We conducted a population-based antituberculosis drug resistance surveillance program in Eastern Taiwan to measure the proportions of notified TB patients with anti-TB drug resistance and the trend from 2004 to 2008. Methods and Findings: All culture-positive TB patients were enrolled. Drug susceptibility testing results of the first isolate of each TB patient in each treatment course were analyzed. In total, 2688 patients were included, of which 2176 (81.0%) were new TB cases and 512 (19.0%) were previously treated cases. Among the 2176 new TB cases, 97 (4.5%) were retreated after the first episode of TB treatment within the study period. The proportion of new patients with any resistance, isoniazid resistance but not multidrug-resistant TB (resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, MDR-TB), and MDR-TB was 16.4%, 7.5%, and 4.0%, respectively, and that among previously treated cases was 30.9%, 7.9%, and 17.6%, respectively. The combined proportion of any resistance decreased from 23.3% in 2004 to 14.3% in 2008, and that of MDR-TB from 11.5% to 2.4%. Conclusions: The proportion of TB patients with drug-resistant TB in Eastern Taiwan remains substantial. However, an effective TB control program has successfully driven the proportion of drug resistance among TB patients downward.		MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MEDICAL-CENTER; PATTERN
10.1371_journal.pone.0032103	Multidrug-Resistant and Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Multi-Ethnic Region, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China	Background: The multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) has emerged as a global threat. Xinjiang is a multi-ethnic region and suffered second highest incidence of TB in China. However, epidemiological information on MDR and XDR TB is scarcely investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings: A prospective study was conducted to analyze the prevalence of MDR and XDR TB and the differences of drug resistance TB between Chinese Han and other nationalities population at Chest Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. We performed in vitro drug susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to first- and second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs for all 1893 culture confirmed positive TB cases that were diagnosed between June 2009 and June 2011. Totally 1117 (59.0%, 95% CI, 56.8%-61.2%) clinical isolates were resistant to >= 1 first-line drugs; the prevalence of MDR TB was 13.2% (95% CI, 11.7%-14.7%), of which, 77 (30.8%; 95% CI, 25.0%-36.6%) and 31 (12.8%; 95% CI, 8.6%-17.0%) isolates were pre-XDR and XDR TB respectively. Among the MDR/XDR TB, Chinese Han patients were significantly less likely to be younger with an odds ratio 0.42 for age 20-29 years and 0.52 for age 40-49 years; P-trend = 0.004), and Chinese Han patients has a lower prevalence of XDR TB (9.6%) than all the other nationality (14.9%). Conclusions/Significance: The burden of drug resistance TB cases is sizeable, which highlights an urgent need to reinforce the control, detection and treatment strategies for drug resistance TB. However, the difference of MDR and XDR TB between Chinese Han and other nationalities was not observed.		MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; XDR TUBERCULOSIS; SOUTH-AFRICA; SHANGHAI; TB
10.1186_1471_2334_12_41	Pattern recognition and cellular immune responses to novel Mycobacterium tuberculosis-antigens in individuals from Belarus	Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is an enduring health problem worldwide and the emerging threat of multidrug resistant (MDR) TB and extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB is of particular concern. A better understanding of biomarkers associated with TB will aid to guide the development of better targets for TB diagnosis and for the development of improved TB vaccines. Methods: Recombinant proteins (n = 7) and peptide pools (n = 14) from M. tuberculosis (M.tb) antigens associated with M.tb pathogenicity, modification of cell lipids or cellular metabolism, were used to compare T cell immune responses defined by IFN-gamma production using a whole blood assay (WBA) from i) patients with TB, ii) individuals recovered from TB and iii) individuals exposed to TB without evidence of clinical TB infection from Minsk, Belarus. Results: We identified differences in M.tb target peptide recognition between the test groups, i.e. a frequent recognition of antigens associated with lipid metabolism, e.g. cyclopropane fatty acyl phospholipid synthase. The pattern of peptide recognition was broader in blood from healthy individuals and those recovered from TB as compared to individuals suffering from pulmonary TB. Detection of biologically relevant M.tb targets was confirmed by staining for intracellular cytokines (IL-2, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma) in T cells from non-human primates (NHPs) after BCG vaccination. Conclusions: PBMCs from healthy individuals and those recovered from TB recognized a broader spectrum of M.tb antigens as compared to patients with TB. The nature of the pattern recognition of a broad panel of M.tb antigens will devise better strategies to identify improved diagnostics gauging previous exposure to M.tb; it may also guide the development of improved TB-vaccines.

10.1371_journal.pone.0031563	Use of a Molecular Diagnostic Test in AFB Smear Positive Tuberculosis Suspects Greatly Reduces Time to Detection of Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis	Background: The WHO has recommended the implementation of rapid diagnostic tests to detect and help combat M/XDR tuberculosis (TB). There are limited data on the performance and impact of these tests in field settings. Methods: The performance of the commercially available Genotype MTBDRplus molecular assay was compared to conventional methods including AFB smear, culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) using both an absolute concentration method on Lowenstein-Jensen media and broth-based method using the MGIT 960 system. Sputum specimens were obtained from TB suspects in the country of Georgia who received care through the National TB Program. Results: Among 500 AFB smear-positive sputum specimens, 458 (91.6%) had both a positive sputum culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a valid MTBDRplus assay result. The MTBDRplus assay detected isoniazid (INH) resistance directly from the sputum specimen in 159 (89.8%) of 177 specimens and MDR-TB in 109 (95.6%) of 114 specimens compared to conventional methods. There was high agreement between the MTBDRplus assay and conventional DST results in detecting MDR-TB (kappa = 0.95, p<0.01). The most prevalent INH resistance mutation was S315T (78%) in the katG codon and the most common rifampicin resistance mutation was S531L (68%) in the rpoB codon. Among 13 specimens from TB suspects with negative sputum cultures, 7 had a positive MTBDRplus assay (3 with MDR-TB). The time to detection of MDR-TB was significantly less using the MTBDRplus assay (4.2 days) compared to the use of standard phenotypic tests (67.3 days with solid media and 21.6 days with broth-based media). Conclusions: Compared to conventional methods, the MTBDRplus assay had high accuracy and significantly reduced time to detection of MDR-TB in an area with high MDR-TB prevalence. The use of rapid molecular diagnostic tests for TB and drug resistance should increase the proportion of patients promptly placed on appropriate therapy.

10.1007_s00264_011_1398_0	Management of drug-resistant spinal tuberculosis with a combination of surgery and individualised chemotherapy: a retrospective analysis of thirty-five patients	Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a major public-health concern globally and can be difficult to manage clinically. Spinal tuberculosis is the most common manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. However, there have been few reports on the topic of drug-resistant spinal tuberculosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and drug susceptibility patterns and the outcomes of management with a combination of surgery and individualised chemotherapy, for drug-resistant spinal tuberculosis. We retrospectively analysed 35 patients with drug-resistant tuberculous spondylitis. After surgery, individualised chemotherapy was tailored for each patient according to the drug-resistance profile and previous history of chemotherapy. The patients were followed up clinically and radiologically for an average period of 35.8 months. Among 35 drug-resistant spinal tuberculosis cases, 13 were retreatment cases. Twelve were multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), and 23 were non-MDR-TB. The patients with MDR-TB and non-MDR-TB had undergone previous chemotherapy for an average of 14.50 +/- 2.00 (0-60) months and 4.56 +/- 1.54 (0-74) months, respectively. A total of 32 cases underwent open operations, and the other three had percutaneous drainage and local chemotherapy. Patients received individualised chemotherapy for an average of 23.6 months postoperatively. Local recurrence was observed in six patients. Thirty-three patients had been cured at the final follow-up, and the other two were still receiving chemotherapy. Drug-resistant tuberculous spondylitis is mainly acquired through previous irregular chemotherapy and the spreading of drug-resistant strains. Management with a combination of surgery and individualised chemotherapy is feasible in the treatment of severe complications and the prevention of acquired drug resistance.

10.2471_BLT.11.092585	Surveillance of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in the world: an updated analysis, 2007-2010	Objective To present a global update of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and explore trends in 1994-2010. Methods Data on drug resistance among new and previously treated TB patients, as reported by countries to the World Health Organization, were analysed. Such data are collected through surveys of a representative sample of TB patients or surveillance systems based on routine drug susceptibility testing. Associations between multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and sex were explored through logistic regression. Findings In 2007-2010, 80 countries and 8 territories reported surveillance data. MDR-TB among new and previously treated cases was highest in the Russian Federation (Murmansk oblast, 28.9%) and the Republic of Moldova (65.1%), respectively. In three former Soviet Union countries and South Africa, more than 10% of the cases of MDR-TB were extensively drug-resistant. Globally, in 1994 to 2010 multidrug resistance was observed in 3.4% (95% confidence interval, Cl: 1.9-5.0) of all new TB case's and in 19.8% (95% Cl: 14.4-25.1) of previously treated TB cases. No overall associations between MDR-TB and HIV infection (odds ratio, OR: 1.4; 95% Cl: 0.7-3.0) or sex (OR: 1.1; 95% Cl: 0.8-1.4) were found. Between 1994 and 2010, MDR-TB rates in the general population increased in Botswana, Peru, the Republic of Korea and declined in Estonia, Latvia and the United States of America. Conclusion The highest global rates of MDR-TB ever reported were documented in 2009 and 2010. Trends in MDR-TB are still unclear in most settings. Better surveillance or survey data are required, especially from Africa and India.		GLOBAL SURVEILLANCE; TUBERCULOSIS; PROJECT; OUTBREAK
10.1128_AAC.05180_11	A Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Model for Capreomycin	The emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has led to a renewed interest in the use of second-line antibiotic agents. Unfortunately, there are currently dearths of information, data, and computational models that can be used to help design rational regimens for administration of these drugs. To help fill this knowledge gap, an exploratory physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, supported by targeted experimental data, was developed to predict the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of the second-line agent capreomycin, a cyclic peptide antibiotic often grouped with the aminoglycoside antibiotics. To account for interindividual variability, Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo methods were used for model calibration, validation, and testing. Along with the predictive PBPK model, the first for an antituberculosis agent, this study provides estimates of various key pharmacokinetic parameter distributions and supports a hypothesized mechanism for capreomycin transport into the kidney.

10.5588_ijtld.10.0795	High prevalence of drug resistance amongst HIV-exposed and -infected children in a tuberculosis prevention trial	An emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) in settings affected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) has been observed. We investigated the prevalence of DR-TB in P1041, a multicentred, randomised, double-blind trial which compared the administration of isoniazid (INH) to placebo, in HIV-exposed, non-infected and -infected African infants in the absence of any documented TB exposure. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was 22.2% (95%CI 8.5-45.8) and INH monoresistance 5.6% (95%CI 0.1-27.6) among culture-confirmed cases, with all MDR-TB occurring in a single site. There was no association between INH treatment or placebo group, or between HIV infection status, and DR-TB prevalence. There was a high prevalence of DR-TB among HIV-exposed and -infected children. Surveillance of DR-TB among children in high-burden TB-HIN settings should be routine.	tuberculosis; resistance; HIV; children; isoniazid prevention	WESTERN CAPE PROVINCE; ISONIAZID PROPHYLAXIS; SOUTH-AFRICA; FOLLOW-UP; INFANTS

A retrospective analysis of data from >81 countries and subnational settings demonstrated that >40% of RMP-resistant isolates from new TB cases did not display resistance to isoniazid (INH) in settings with relatively low MDR-TB prevalence (one third of all countries and subnational settings). Results indicated the need for INH susceptibility testing in addition to RMP susceptibility testing.	tuberculosis; rifampin resistance; Xpert (R) MTB/RIF assay	
10.5588_ijtld.11.0395	False-positive rifampicin resistance on Xpert (R) MTB/RIF: case report and clinical implications	The World Health Organization had endorsed Xpert (R) MTB/RIF (Xpert) as the initial diagnostic for multi-drugresistant tuberculosis (TB) or TB suspects co-infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. We investigated an unexpected case of rifampicin (RMP) resistance on Xpert using repeat Xpert, smear microscopy, MTBDRplus assay, culture, drug susceptibility testing, spoligotyping and rpoB gene sequencing. A false-positive result was most likely, given the wild type rpoB gene sequence and exclusion of both mixed infection and mixture of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant populations. When decentralising Xpert, test performance characteristics need to be understood by health care workers and methods of confirmation of RMP resistance need to be accessible.	tuberculosis; MDR-TB; assay performance; false-positive rifampicin resistance	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DIAGNOSIS
10.5588_ijtld.11.0401	Comparing early treatment outcomes of MDR-TB in decentralised and centralised settings in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa	SETTING: In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, a setting endemic for tuberculosis (TB) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), prolonged hospitalisation for the treatment of the growing number of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients is neither possible nor effective. OBJECTIVE: To compare early treatment outcomes in patients with MDR-TB with and without HIV co-infection at four decentralised rural sites with a central urban referral hospital. DESIGN: This is an operational, prospective cohort study of patients between 1 July 2008 and 30 November 2009, where culture conversion, time to culture conversion, survival and predictors of these outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: Of 860 patients with MDR-TB, 419 were at the decentralised sites and 441 at the central hospital. Overall, 71% were HIV co-infected. In the 17-month study period, there was a higher proportion of culture conversion at the decentralised sites compared with the centralised hospital (54% vs. 24%, P < 0.001, OR 3.76, 95 %CI 2.81-5.03). The median time to treatment initiation was significantly shorter at the decentralised sites compared with the centralised hospital (72 vs. 93 days, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in survival following treatment initiation. CONCLUSION: In this study, early treatment outcomes suggest that decentralised care for MDR-TB patients is superior to that in a centralised setting.	operational research; high burden of TB and HIV	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; COMMUNITY-BASED TREATMENT; HIV; OPPORTUNITIES; CHALLENGES; LIMA; PERU; CARE

10.1016_j.jpba.2011.09.030	An LC-MS/MS method for the determination of ofloxacin in 20 mu l human plasma	A sensitive and selective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the determination of ofloxacin in 20 mu l human plasma over the concentration range of 0.078-20 mu g/ml. Sample preparation was achieved by protein precipitation with acetonitrile and methanol containing the internal standard (Gatifloxacin). Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Luna 5 mu m PFP (110 A, 50 x 2 mm) column with acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% formic acid (50:50, v/v) as the mobile phase, at a flow rate of 400 mu l/ml. The within-day and between-day precision determinations for ofloxacin, expressed as the percentage coefficient of variation, were lower than 7% at all test concentrations. Recovery of ofloxacin was greater than 70% and reproducible at the low, medium and high end of the dynamic range. No significant matrix effects were observed for the analyte or internal standard. The assay was successfully used to examine the pharmacokinetics of ofloxacin as part of a study to characterize the pharmacokinetics of a number of anti-tuberculosis drugs utilized in the treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).

10.1371_journal.pone.0030194	Strategies for Treating Latent Multiple-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis: A Decision Analysis	"Background: The optimal treatment for latent multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis infection remains unclear. In anticipation of future clinical trials, we modeled the expected performance of six potential regimens for treatment of latent multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis. Methods: A computerized Markov model to analyze the total cost of treatment for six different regimens: Pyrazinamide/ethambutol, moxifloxacin monotherapy, moxifloxacin/pyrazinamide, moxifloxacin/ethambutol, moxifloxacin/ethionamide, and moxifloxacin/PA-824. Efficacy estimates were extrapolated from mouse models and examined over a wide range of assumptions. Results: In the base-case, moxifloxacin monotherapy was the lowest cost strategy, but moxifloxacin/ethambutol was cost-effective at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $21,252 per quality-adjusted life-year. Both pyrazinamide-containing regimens were dominated due to their toxicity. A hypothetical regimen of low toxicity and even modest efficacy was cost-effective compared to ""no treatment."" Conclusion: In our model, moxifloxacin/ethambutol was the preferred treatment strategy under a wide range of assumptions; pyrazinamide-containing regimens fared poorly because of high rates of toxicity. Although more data are needed on efficacy of treatments for latent MDR-TB infection, data on toxicity and treatment discontinuation, which are easier to obtain, could have a substantial impact on public health practice."

10.1371_journal.pone.0030281	Are Tuberculosis Patients in a Tertiary Care Hospital in Hyderabad, India Being Managed According to National Guidelines?	Setting: A tertiary health care facility (Government General and Chest hospital) in Hyderabad, India. Objectives: To assess a) the extent of compliance of specialists to standardized national (RNTCP) tuberculosis management guidelines and b) if patients on discharge from hospital were being appropriately linked up with peripheral health facilities for continuation of anti-Tuberculosis (TB) treatment. Methods: A descriptive study using routine programme data and involving all TB patients admitted to inpatient care from 1(st) January to 30(th) June, 2010. Results and Conclusions: There were a total of 3120 patients admitted of whom, 1218 (39%) required anti-TB treatment. Of these 1104 (98%) were treated with one of the RNTCP recommended regimens, while 28 (2%) were treated with non-RNTCP regimens. The latter included individually tailored MDR-TB treatment regimens for 19 patients and adhoc regimens for nine patients. A total of 957 (86%) patients were eventually discharged from the hospital of whom 921 (96%) had a referral form filled for continuing treatment at a peripheral health facility. Formal feedback from peripheral health facilities on continuation of TB treatment was received for 682 (74%) patients. In a tertiary health facility with specialists the great majority of TB patients are managed in line with national guidelines. However a number of short-comings were revealed and measures to rectify these are discussed.

Methods: We collected health utility data from Thai patients who were on TB treatment or had been successfully treated for TB for the purpose of economic modeling. Structured questionnaire and EuroQol (EQ-5D) and EuroQol visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) instruments were used as data collection tools. We compared utility of patients with two co-morbidities calculated using multiplicative model (U-CAL) with the direct measures and fitted Tobit regression models to examine factors predictive of health utility and to assess difference in health utilities of patients in various medical conditions. Results: Of 222 patients analyzed, 138 (62%) were male; median age at enrollment was 40 years (interquartile range [IQR], 35-47). Median monthly household income was 6,000 Baht (187 US$; IQR, 4,000-15,000 Baht [125-469 US$]). Concordance correlation coefficient between utilities measured using EQ-5D and EQ-VAS (UEQ-5D and U-VAS, respectively) was 0.6. U-CAL for HIV-infected TB patients was statistically different from the measured UEQ-5D (p-value<0.01) and U-VAS (p-value<0.01). In tobit regression analysis, factors independently predictive of UEQ-5D included age and monthly household income. Patients aged >= 40 years old rated UEQ-5D significantly lower than younger persons. Higher UEQ-5D was significantly associated with higher monthly household income in a dose response fashion. The median UEQ-5D was highest among patients who had been successfully treated for TB and lowest among multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients who were on treatment. Conclusions: U-CAL of patients with two co-morbidities overestimated the measured utilities, warranting further research of how best to estimate utilities of patients with such conditions. TB and MDR-TB treatments impacted on patients' self perceived health status. This effect diminished after successful treatment.

10.2169_internalmedicine.51.8076	Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis with a History of Nontuberculous Mycobacteriosis: A Brief Report of Two Cases	We herein report two cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in patients with a history of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteriosis (PNTM). A 50-year-old man was diagnosed with MDR-TB five years after receiving treatment for pulmonary Mycobacterium kansasii infection. In the second patient, a 72-year-old woman, the diagnosis of PNTM was confirmed twice with two bronchial washings; she was diagnosed with MDR-TB 29 months after presenting with PNTM. It is highly possible that these two patients were already infected with tuberculosis (TB) at the time of PNTM diagnosis and acquired resistance to anti-TB drugs as a result of undergoing treatment for PNTM.	diagnosis; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteriosis; treatment	
pub-1253	Study prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Tuberculosis in East Azerbaijan province of Iran	Background and objectives: Drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) is a man-made problem. While tuberculosis is hundred percent curable, multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is difficult to treat. Inadequate and incomplete treatment and poor treatment adherence has led to a newer form of drug resistance known as extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). The aim of this study was to determine prevalence of XDR-TB in east Azerbaijan province of Iran. Methods: Drug susceptibility testing to second line drugs including amikacin, kanamycin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was performed on isolated eight MDR-TB strains. H37RV Mycobacterium tuberculosis (susceptible to all drugs) was used as a control strain. Results: Eight strains out of 230 isolates (3.48%) were diagnosed to be MDR-TB, and three strains (1.3%) out of eight MDR-TB strains, were found to be XDR. All three XDR strains were from patients who had come to Iran from Nakhchivan of Azerbaijan. All patents were male. Conclusion: Since the XDR-TB was only seen from Nakhchivanian patients isolates, referring these patients to Tabriz Research Center of TB and pulmonary diseases for diagnosis and treatment is problematic, and special measures should be taken.

pub-1254	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Rawalpindi, Pakistan	Introduction: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) strains are resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin. Clinical characteristics, drug susceptibility patterns, and outcomes of MDR-TB patients treated at Holy Family Hospital, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, were studied from January 2007 to April 2010. Methodology: Thirty diagnosed patients (60% male and 40% female) of MDR pulmonary TB were included. Each patient was treated according to WHO guidelines and followed for two years. Clinical characteristics (age, gender, literate or illiterate educational status, employment status, and income), drug susceptibility testing (DST) reports, and outcome (cured, treatment failure, default, and died) of each patient was noted. Results: Mean patient age was 36.2 +/- 15.4 years. In total, 60% patients were illiterate, 60% employed, 60% had income < Rs 5000 (42 Euro per month), 73.3% lived in an overcrowded residence, 60% were smokers, and 83.3% had taken anti-tuberculosis therapy previously. DST of MDR-TB strains for ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin showed high resistance (> 60%). Except for ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, < 20% resistance was noted in second-line anti-tuberculosis agents. Overall, 10% of patients were cured, 40% died, 20% had treatment failure, and 30% patients defaulted. Conclusion: Pulmonary MDR-TB in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, is common in young males, poverty related circumstances, and has poor outcome.

10.5897_AJPP11.762	A meta analysis of the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in Chinese patients with multi-drug resistant pulmonary tuberculosisosis	This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in treating Chinese patients with multi-drug resistant pulmonary tuberculosisosis (MDR-TB). Medicinal databases and review articles were screened with pre-specified criteria for randomized controlled trials that reported the effects of and adverse reactions to moxifloxacin and other antituberculosisosis drugs in treating Chinese patients with MDR-TB. The quality of included studies was critically evaluated. A total of 948 articles were found and 12 articles finally included. Heterogeneity test: Sputum negative conversion analysis (Q statistic = 9.43, p = 0.58, I-2 = 0%), change of pulmonary tuberculosisosis cavity analysis (Q statistic = 2.93, p = 0.89, I-2 = 0%), focus absorption analysis (Q statistic = 20.13, p = 0.03, I-2 = 50%) and safety analysis (Q statistic = 10.98, p = 0.44, I-2 = 0%). The results of meta-analysis showed that compared with the control group, moxifloxacin was more effective in sputum negative conversion (OR = 3.34, 95% CI: 2.37 to 4.70) and focus absorption (OR = 2.53, 95% CI: 1.55 to 4.12). Moreover, moxifloxacin was safer than control group (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.96). Funnel-plot displayed some unsymmetrical figures, indicating there were publication biases in each analysis. The evidence currently available shows that the moxifloxacin treatment on Chinese patients with MDR-TB is useful for the sputum negative conversion and focus absorption.

pub-1256	Status of First-Line Anti-TB drugs: An Audit of 84 Clinical Sputum AFB Isolates in Karachi	Objective: To evaluate the current incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) among positive sputum culture isolates in two commercial laboratories in Karachi, Pakistan. Methodology: In this laboratory-based study eighty four AFB smear-positive sputum culture isolates grown on routine Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium in two separate diagnostic labs during 12 months ending August 2011 were identified and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing using LJ medium and anti-TB First-Line drugs (FLD). MICs of the control H37RV-NCTC strain 7416 were compared with the test strains inoculated with the batch tested. Results were evaluated by the traditional resistance ratio method. Results: The sputa expectorated by 45 females (53.57%) and 39 males (46.43%) aged 15-58 years yielded 84 M. tuberculosis isolates. The percentages of FLD resistance were Rifampicin (48.8%), Streptomycin (28.57%), Ethambutol (7.14%), and Isoniazid (4.76%). Kanamycin (28.57%) was also tested. Only 12 (14.28%) of these were sensitive to all the FLDs, and 4 (4.76%) were MDR-TB strains (indifferent to Rifampicin and lsoniazid). Conclusion: The sparse labs in Karachi that do AFB-cultures should periodically assess and publicize the frequency of MDR-TB isolates to guide empirical therapy. Rifampicin, a consistent part of the initial drug regimen for empirical prescription, was currently least effective on the strains encountered.

10.1080_02786826.2011.634453	Inhalable Antibiotics Manufactured Through Use of Near-Critical or Supercritical Fluids	"The development of unit-dose, inhalable, antibiotic microparticles for use in primary and combined therapy approaches to treating tuberculosis (TB), multi-drug-resistant (MDR-TB), and extensively drug-resistant TB is explored using the gentle drying process of Carbon-dioxide Assisted Nebulization with a Bubble Dryer (CAN-BD). The microparticles produced using this method contain capreomycin, kanamycin, and isoniazid, respectively, imbedded in L-leucine. Antibiotics were developed into inhalable antibiotic formulations for their utility in both first line and second line antibiotic treatment regimens. Capreomycin and kanamycin are typically administered by injection making them desirable candidates for the development of a needle-free delivery system that addresses the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative #3. In response to this challenge, unit-dose packaging that preserves powder properties by protecting them from moisture, oxidants, and UV exposure, and a low cost ""active"" dry powder inhaler, the PuffHaler, were developed and used as a prototype device, in addition to the Aerolizer, to disperse the microparticle antibiotic formulations. Antibiotic formulations show yields above 50% in small-scale powder production by CAN-BD. Capreomycin and kanamycin show improved powder yields in scale up experiments. The particle properties were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, Karl Fischer moisture analysis, Anderson Cascade Impaction studies, and X-ray diffraction. The inhalable antibiotic formulations are within a respirable size range (1-5 mu m), and have less than 3% residual moisture. Unit-dose dry powder antibiotics have the potential to provide easy-to-use, stable products with improved safety profiles."

10.1016_j.ejmech.2011.10.041	Pharmacophore insights into rpoB gene mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis rifampicin resistant isolates	This paper reports the susceptibility profile to rifabutin (RFB) 1 and six recently synthesized RFB analogs 3-8, of either rifampicin (RFP) susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis and resistant clinical isolates from two sources: Mexico and Brazil. Taking into account that about 95% of M. tuberculosis strains resistant to RFP present mutations in the rpoB gene, with some of these mutations being determinant also to RFB resistance, the RFB analogs were screened for activity against a set of known RFP susceptible and resistant strains. N'-Acetyl-RFB 5 and N'-(undec-10 ''-enoyl)-RFB 8 showed the best results, in particular with mutations in the codon 516, 522 and 531 of the rpoB gene, and were therefore selected for in vivo assessment of their efficacy. Studies conducted with tuberculous Balb/C mice previously infected with Ser531Leu mutated clinical isolate, evidenced both 5 and 8 as promoters of a significant decrease on tubercle bacilli burden in lungs associated with lower tissue damage, thus confirming them as good leads for drug discovery. The SAR of the acylated compounds 5 and 8 envisaging the identification of pharmacophore features, highlights the importance of profiling more clearly the chemistry within the molecular aspects for elucidation of the mode of action of RFB and analogs, in relation to mutations in Multidrug-Resistant (MDR) strains.

10.4103_0255_0857.93039	Evaluation of the microscopic observational drug susceptibility assay for rapid and efficient diagnosis of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis	Purpose: Tuberculosis (TB) is endemic in India and the burden of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is high. Early detection of MDR-TB is of primary importance in controlling the spread of TB. The microscopic observational drug susceptibility (MODS) assay has been described as a cost-effective and rapid method by which mycobacterial culture and the drug susceptibility test (DST) can be done at the same time. Materials and Methods: A total of 302 consecutive sputum samples that were received in an accredited mycobacteriology laboratory for conventional culture and DST were evaluated by the MODS assay. Results: In comparison with conventional culture on Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) media, the MODS assay showed a sensitivity of 94.12% and a specificity of 89.39% and its concordance with the DST by the proportion method on LJ media to isoniazid and rifampicin was 90.8% and 91.5%, respectively. The turnaround time for results by MODS was 9 days compared to 21 days by culture on LJ media and an additional 42 days for DST by the 1% proportion method. The cost of performing a single MODS assay was Rs. 250/-, compared to Rs. 950/- for culture and 1st line DST on LJ. Conclusion: MODS was found to be a sensitive and rapid alternative method for performing culture and DST to identify MDR-TB in resource poor settings.

10.1258_td.2011.110247	Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis: the experience of an urban tertiary care hospital in South India using automated BACTEC 460 TB	The emergence of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) strains has been a major obstacle in the tuberculosis (TB) control programme. In the present study we looked into the prevalence of MDR-TB in an urban tertiary care hospital in South India over four years (2007-2010). During this period, 641 clinical specimens (317 respiratory specimens and 324 non-respiratory specimens) were received for mycobacteriological culture and drug susceptibility testing for first-line drugs, using the BACTEC 460 TB system. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) was isolated in 34.8% (n = 223) specimens. Of the total 223 MTB isolates 83 (37.2%) were MDR. Forty-two percent of the pulmonary MTB isolates (n = 72) and 20.4% of the extra-pulmonary isolates (n = 10) were MDR. Although we observed a high percentage of drug resistance, the prevalence of MDR was not observed to vary significantly within the four years which suggested good management.		
pub-1262	DETECTION OF MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS DIRECTLY FROM SPUTUM SAMPLES OF PATIENTS FROM JAKARTA, INDONESIA BY RADIOISOTOPE-BASED PCR-DOT BLOT HYBRIDIZATION	The problem of eradicating tuberculosis (TB) has become more complicated by the emergence of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB). Any rapid laboratory method that can be used to detect drug susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is urgently needed. In this study, we employed the radioisotope (P-32)-based PCR-dot blot hybridization method on sputum samples from patients in Jakarta, Indonesia. Bacterial DNA was extracted using BOOM method. KatG and rpo beta were amplified by PCR and katG315 or rpo beta 531 mutations were identified by dot blot hybridization. Of 100 samples, 11% and 22% showed presence of mutation at codons 315 (AGC -> ACC) of katG and 531 (TCG -> TTG) of rpo beta, respectively. Five percent of the samples showed both mutations. This method is rapid, sensitive, and reliable and can be used to screen large numbers of samples in epidemiological studies.

10.1016_j.tube.2011.09.008	Characteristics of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in southern Brazil	A major threat to tuberculosis (TB) control programs is the emergence of drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains that cause TB that cannot be cured by standard anti-TB drug regimens. Because few data exist on MDR-TB in this region of the country, we performed an epidemiologic study that combined conventional and molecular analysis of MDR-TB cases from Rio Grande do Sul (RS) that were diagnosed in this period and included cases that were under treatment with second line drug schemes. Included were 121 MDR cases and sequencing of rpoB and katG showed that 106 (87.6%) strains were mutated in rpoB and 97 (80.2%) in katG. Spoligotyping demonstrated that the LAM genotype was predominant (n = 70, 57.8%) and included the largest group composed by 22 (18.1%) strains with the LAM5 ST93 genotype. Other main genotypes belonged to the families T (n = 22, 18.2%), U family (n = 16, 13.2%), Haarlem (n = 5, 4.1%) and X (n = 1, 0.8%). Genotyping by IS6110-RFLP analysis showed 51 distinct fingerprints, 38 (31.4%) of these observed only once and the other 13 patterns being shared among the rest of the isolates (n = 83, 68.6%). Among the 22 strains that were LAM5 ST93, only two had different IS6110-RFLP genotypes. In conclusion, there exists a high degree of M. Tuberculosis genotype clustering among MDR-TB cases in Rio Grande do Sul. Moreover, we observed a large MDR-TB outbreak. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.1111_j.1752_699X.2011.00242.x	MDR-TB in Finland - still rare despite the situation in our neighbouring countries	Introduction: The multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) epidemic in Eastern Europe bordering Finland has raised worries concerning the risk of disease in near-frontier contacts. Objectives: Our aim was to find out the amount of multidrug resistance, characterise the resistance profiles and evaluate the outcome of treatment. In addition, we analysed the isolates by molecular genotyping methods in order to evaluate the origins of the resistant isolates. Methods: All culture-verified new MDR-TB cases diagnosed during the years 1994-2005 were included. Treatment outcome categories of the World Health Organization collected 36 months from the beginning of the treatment were used for outcome monitoring. The IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) test and spoligotyping were carried out according to standard recommendations. Results: There were 19 culture-confirmed MDR-TB cases during the study period. The mean age was 39.9 years. The proportion of foreign-born patients was 73.7%. The outcome of the treatment was favourable in 14 cases (73.7%). When the spoligotypes were compared with the international spoligotype database, a corresponding spoligotype was found in 17 cases. Seven (36.8%) patients were infected by an isolate belonging to the Beijing genotype (SIT1). Conclusion: It is very probable that cases of MDR-TB in Finland are mostly caught abroad. Risk of gaining disease in near-frontier contacts seems to be very low.	MDR-TB; molecular genotyping; treatment outcome; tuberculosis	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS
10.3201_eid1801.110850	High Prevalence of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis, Swaziland, 2009-2010	In Africa, although emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) represents a serious threat in countries severely affected by the HIV epidemic, most countries lack drug-resistant TB data. This finding was particularly true in the Kingdom of Swaziland, which has the world's highest HIV and TB prevalences. Therefore, we conducted a national survey in 2009-2010 to measure prevalence of drug-resistant TB. Of 988 patients screened, 420 new case-patients and 420 previously treated case-patients met the study criteria. Among culture-positive patients, 15.3% new case-patients and 49.5% previously treated case-patients harbored drug-resistant strains. MDR TB prevalence was 7.7% and 33.8% among new case-patients and previously treated case-patients, respectively. HIV infection and past TB treatment were independently associated with MDR TB. The findings assert the need for wide-scale intervention in resource-limited contexts such as Swaziland, where diagnostic and treatment facilities and health personnel are lacking.

10.5588_ijtld.11.0153	Risk factors for mortality among MDR- and XDR-TB patients in a high HIV prevalence setting	SETTING : Recent studies suggest that the prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in sub-Saharan Africa may be rising. This is of concern, as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection in multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB has been associated with exceedingly high mortality rates. OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors associated with mortality in MDR- and XDR-TB patients co-infected with HIV in South Africa. DESIGN: Case-control study of patients who died of all causes within 2 years of diagnosis with MDR- or XDR-TB. RESULTS: Among 123 MDR-TB patients, 78 (63%) died following diagnosis. CD4 count <= 50 (HR 4.64, P = 0.01) and 51-200 cells/mm(3) (HR 4.17, P = 0.008) were the strongest independent risk factors for mortality. Among 139 XDR-TB patients, 111 (80%) died. CD4 count <= 50 cells/mm(3) (HR 4.46, P = 0.01) and resistance to all six drugs tested (HR 2.54, P = 0.04) were the principal risk factors. Use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) was protective (HR 0.34, P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality due to MDR- and XDR-TB was associated with greater degree of immunosuppression and drug resistance. Efforts to reduce mortality must focus on preventing the amplification of resistance by strengthening TB treatment programs, as well as reducing the pool of immunosuppressed HIV-infected patients through aggressive HIV testing and ART initiation.

10.5588_ijtld.10.0600	Evaluation of the GenoType (R) MTBDRsl assay for susceptibility testing of second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs	BACKGROUND: The GenoType (R) MTBDRsl assay is a new rapid assay for the detection of resistance to second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the MTBDRsl assay on 342 multidrug-resistant tuberculosis isolates for resistance to ofloxacin (OFX), kanamycin (KM), capreomycin (CPM) and ethambutol (EMB), to compare the results to the agar proportion method, and to test discrepant results using DNA sequencing. RESULT: The sensitivity and specificity of the MTBDRsl assay were respectively 70.3% and 97.7% for OFX, 25.0% and 98.7% for KM, 21.2% and 98.7% for CPM and 56.3% and 56.0% for EMB. DNA sequencing identified mutations that were not detected by the MTBDRsl assay. The 8/11 phenotypically OFX-resistant isolates had mutations in gyrA (2/8 had an additional mutation in the gyrB gene), 1/11 had mutations only in the gyrB gene, 6/21 phenotypically KM-resistant isolates had mutations in the rrs gene, and 7/26 and 20/26 phenotypically CPM-resistant isolates had mutations in the rrs and tlyA genes. CONCLUSION: The MTBDRsl assay showed lower sensitivity than previous studies. The assay performed favourably for OFX; however, it was less sensitive in the detection of KM/CPM resistance and demonstrated low sensitivity and specificity for EMB resistance. It is recommended that the MTBDRsl assay include additional genes to achieve better sensitivity for all the drugs tested.

10.5588_ijtld.11.0129	Integrated detection of multi- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis using the nitrate reductase assay	It currently takes 2-3 months to obtain a diagnosis for multidrug-resistant (MDR-) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). We evaluated the rapid non-commercial nitrate reductase assay (NRA), which is capable of the simultaneous detection of MDR- and XDR-TB, and compared the results with the proportion method (PM). The sensitivity was respectively 97%, 99%, 100% and 94.6% for rifampicin (RMP), isoniazid (INH), ofloxacin (OFX) and kanamycin (KM). The specificity was respectively 100%, 95%, 95.7% and 99% for RMP, INH, OFX and KM. The turnaround time for NRA was 10-14 days, compared to 4-6 weeks for the PM. Our study showed that NRA provided sensitive and specific detection of resistance to first- and second-line drugs.

10.3109_00365548.2011.611169	Determination of risk factors for isoniazid monoresistance and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in treatment failure patients	India has a high number of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases. Patient records were screened to determine risk factors possibly associated with monoresistance and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in comparison with patients with susceptible TB. We retrospectively screened and selected 250 patient records from a tertiary care centre, in which detailed clinical histories were provided. Of the 250 patients, 10 had isoniazid monoresistant TB, 184 patients had MDR-TB, and 56 patients had TB susceptible to first-line drugs. Binary regression analysis revealed that previous treatment with a fluoroquinolone and an injectable other than streptomycin (odds ratio (OR) 3.889, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.828-8.272) was associated with MDR-TB. Previous history of TB (OR 0.697, 95% CI 0.363-1.338) and the presence of cavities on radiographs (OR 0.371, 95% CI 0.160-0.862) did not show any association. None of these reported risk factors were associated with isoniazid monoresistance. In conclusion, a history of previous treatment with a fluoroquinolone and an injectable other than streptomycin was found to be a risk factor for MDR-TB.

10.5588_ijtld.10.0791	A national infection control evaluation of drug-resistant tuberculosis hospitals in South Africa	BACKGROUND: The importance of infection control (IC) in health care settings with tuberculosis (TB) patients has been highlighted by recent health care-associated outbreaks in South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To conduct operational evaluations of IC in drug-resistant TB settings at a national level. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted from June to September 2009 in all multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) facilities in South Africa. Structured interviews with key informants were completed, along with observation of IC practices. Health care workers (HCWs) were asked to complete an anonymous knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) questionnaire. Multilevel modeling was used to take into consideration the relationship between center and HCW level variables. RESULTS: Twenty-four M(X)DR-TB facilities (100%) were enrolled. Facility infrastructure and staff adherence to IC recommendations were highly varied between facilities. Key informant interviews were incongruent with direct observation of practices in all settings. A total of 499 HCWs were enrolled in the KAP evaluation. Higher level of clinical training was associated with greater IC knowledge (P < 0.001), more appropriate attitudes (P < 0.001) and less time spent with coughing patients (P < 0.001). IC practices were poor across all disciplines. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate a clear need to improve and standardize IC infrastructure in drug-resistant TB settings in South Africa.

10.1038_ng.1038	Whole-genome sequencing of rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains identifies compensatory mutations in RNA polymerase genes	Epidemics of drug-resistant bacteria emerge worldwide, even as resistant strains frequently have reduced fitness compared to their drug-susceptible counterparts(1). Data from model systems suggest that the fitness cost of antimicrobial resistance can be reduced by compensatory mutations(2); however, there is limited evidence that compensatory evolution has any significant role in the success of drug-resistant bacteria in human populations(3-6). Here we describe a set of compensatory mutations in the RNA polymerase genes of rifampicin-resistant M. tuberculosis, the etiologic agent of human tuberculosis (TB). M. tuberculosis strains harboring these compensatory mutations showed a high competitive fitness in vitro. Moreover, these mutations were associated with high fitness in vivo, as determined by examining their relative clinical frequency across patient populations. Of note, in countries with the world's highest incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB(7), more than 30% of MDR clinical isolates had this form of mutation. Our findings support a role for compensatory evolution in the global epidemics of MDR TB(8).

10.1016_j.buildenv.2011.03.011	Retrospective analysis of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis outbreak during a flight using computational fluid dynamics and infection risk assessment	Air travel brings convenience to humans but also hastens the global spread of infectious diseases. Not only transporting infectious individuals from one place to another, air travel also provides a chance for infectious diseases transmission during the flight, especially if the disease can be transmitted via the airborne route. A number of documented outbreaks of airborne transmissible diseases were associated with disease transmission during the air travel. This study performed retrospective analysis on an infamous multi-drug resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) outbreak on a commercial flight, where 6 people were infected with the multi-drug resistant disease during the 8.75 h flight. Airflow pattern and the infectious particle dispersion in the aircraft cabin were simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Infection risks of the passengers under a range of infectious source strength values were then assessed using the dose-response model. Based on the risk data, the infectious source strength of the index case passenger was estimated by likelihood analysis. A concept of mix-ratio was introduced to estimate the impact of human movement and cough behavior on the disease transmission. From the maximum likelihood estimation, the index case passenger may have generated 17.2 millions of viable bacilli/hr during the flight. Spatial pattern of the infection case and the spatial variation of infection risk were reflected in this estimation. The findings of this study provide additional understanding of infectious disease transmission during air travel. The infectious source strength of MDR-TB estimated from this study can be used in further risk assessment on the disease. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.1186_1472_6807_11_47	Docking studies on novel analogues of 8 methoxy fluoroquinolones against GyrA mutants of Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Background: Fluoroquinolone resistance is a serious threat in the battle against the treatment of multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). Fluoroquinolone resistant isolates from India had shown to have evolved several mutants in the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of DNA gyrase A subunit (GyrA), the target of fluoroquinolone. In view of high prevalence of mutations in the 'hot spot' region, a study on combinatorial drug design was carried out to identify better analogues for the treatment of MDR-TB. The gyrA subunit 'hot spot' region of codons 90, 94 and 95 were modeled into their corresponding protein folds and used as receptors for the docking studies. Further, invitro tests were carried using the parent compounds, namely gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin and correlated with the obtained docking scores. Results: Molecular docking and in vitro studies correlated well in demonstrating the enhanced activity of moxifloxacin, when compared to gatifloxacin, on ofloxacin sensitive and resistant strains comprising of clinical isolates of MDR-TB. The evolved lead structures targeting against mutant QRDR receptors were guanosine and cholesteryl esters of gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. They showed consistently high binding affinity values of -10.3 and -10.1 kcal/ mol respectively with the target receptors. Of these, the guanosine ester showed highest binding affinity score and its log P value lied within the Lipinski's range indicating that it could have better absorptivity when it is orally administered thereby having an enhanced activity against MTB. Conclusions: The docking results showed that the addition of the cholesteryl and guanosine esters to the 'DNA gyrase binding' region of gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin enhanced the binding affinity of these parent molecules with the mutant DNA gyrase receptors. Viewing the positive correlation for the docking and in vitro results with the parent compounds, these lead structures could be further evaluated for their in vitro and in vivo activity against MDR-TB.

10.1099_jmm.0.034876_0	Clustering of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains from foreign-born patients in Korea	Information on drug resistance and transmission patterns of tuberculosis (TB) in foreign-born patients is lacking in Asia where immigration is increasing. We examined the drug-resistance profiles of 288 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from foreign-born patients in South Korea, and assessed for potential transmission in the host country by analysing their IS6110 genotypes, as well as those of 4780 strains from native Korean TB patients. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB was 9.7% and 42 % among new and previously treated patients, respectively. Chinese nationality was associated with MDR TB (OR(China)=3.0, 95% CI 1.1-9.3). Of the 288 strains, 51 (17.7 %) formed 31 clusters, of which 22 were identical to strains from native Koreans. A number of strains belonged to the K family, subtypes known to occur endemically in Korea. MDR TB was common, and clustering patterns showed potential cross-cultural transmission among foreign-born TB patients. Further molecular epidemiological studies of all isolates in the area are needed to determine the extent of international TB transmission in Asia.

10.1638_2011_0040.1	GENITOURINARY AND PULMONARY MULTIDRUG RESISTANT MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION IN AN ASIAN ELEPHANT (ELEPHAS MAXIMUS)	A female Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) developed vaginal and trunk discharge. Cultures were positive for pan-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Isoniazid and pyrazinamide were given rectally and monitored by serum levels. After being trained at 10 mo to accept oral dosing, treatment was changed and rifampin was added. Oral medications were administered for another 10 mo. A year after completion of therapy, the vaginal discharge increased and cultures yielded M. tuberculosis, resistant to isoniazid and rifampin. Treatment with oral ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and enrofloxacin and intramuscular amikacin was initiated. Although follow-up cultures became negative, adverse reactions to medications precluded treatment completion. Due to public health concerns related to multidrug resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB), the elephant was euthanized. Postmortem smears from the lung, peribronchial, and abdominal lymph nodes yielded acid-fast bacteria, although cultures were negative. This case highlights important considerations in the treatment of M. tuberculosis in animals and the need for a consistent approach to diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.

10.1371_journal.pone.0028066	Ambulatory Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment Outcomes in a Cohort of HIV-Infected Patients in a Slum Setting in Mumbai, India	Background: India carries one quarter of the global burden of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and has an estimated 2.5 million people living with HIV. Despite this reality, provision of treatment for MDR-TB is extremely limited, particularly for HIV-infected individuals. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has been treating HIV-infected MDR-TB patients in Mumbai since May 2007. This is the first report of treatment outcomes among HIV-infected MDR-TB patients in India. Methods: HIV-infected patients with suspected MDR-TB were referred to the MSF-clinic by public Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Centers or by a network of community non-governmental organizations. Patients were initiated on either empiric or individualized second-line TB-treatment as per WHO recommendations. MDR-TB treatment was given on an ambulatory basis and under directly observed therapy using a decentralized network of providers. Patients not already receiving ART were started on treatment within two months of initiating MDR-TB treatment. Results: Between May 2007 and May 2011, 71 HIV-infected patients were suspected to have MDR-TB, and 58 were initiated on treatment. MDR-TB was confirmed in 45 (78%), of which 18 (40%) were resistant to ofloxacin. Final treatment outcomes were available for 23 patients; 11 (48%) were successfully treated, 4 (17%) died, 6 (26%) defaulted, and 2 (9%) failed treatment. Overall, among 58 patients on treatment, 13 (22%) were successfully treated, 13 (22%) died, 7 (12%) defaulted, two (3%) failed treatment, and 23 (40%) were alive and still on treatment at the end of the observation period. Twenty-six patients (45%) experienced moderate to severe adverse events, requiring modification of the regimen in 12 (20%). Overall, 20 (28%) of the 71 patients with MDR-TB died, including 7 not initiated on treatment. Conclusions: Despite high fluoroquinolone resistance and extensive prior second-line treatment, encouraging results are being achieved in an ambulatory MDR-T-program in a slum setting in India. Rapid scale-up of both ART and second-line treatment for MDR-TB is needed to ensure survival of co-infected patients and mitigate this growing epidemic.

10.5588_ijtld.11.0392	Xpert (R) MTB/RIF for national tuberculosis programmes in low-income countries: when, where and how?	Xpert (R) MTB/RIF offers new and important possibilities for the diagnosis of sputum smear-negative tuberculosis (TB) and/or rifampicin (RMP) resistance, and many are encouraging rapid and widespread implementation. This simple test can be implemented almost everywhere, and it provides results within a few hours. In low-income countries (LICs), however, its cost, environmental limitations (stable and regular electricity, adequate room temperature) and difficulties involved in supply and maintenance are major obstacles. While it may be suitable for major reference hospitals, operational research is needed to evaluate the test and its additional yield above high-quality smear microscopy and clinical algorithms before its use at the peripheral level. In the meantime, direct microscopy should remain the initial diagnostic test for TB suspects. In most LICs, the prevalence of RMP resistance among new TB patients is very low; an Xpert MTB/RIF result indicating RMP resistance will thus always need confirmation by another test. In a population at high risk of RMP resistance (>15%), however, the positive predictive value for RMP resistance by Xpert MTB/RIF is high, and identification of RMP resistance is an excellent proxy for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). The assay should be widely used for this purpose if, and only if, excellent MDR-TB management is available, both for ethical reasons and to reduce the risk of extensively drug-resistant TB.	tuberculosis; diagnostics; GeneXpert; low-income countries; Xpert (R) MTB/RIF	DIAGNOSIS; RESISTANCE; ACCURACY
10.5588_ijtld.11.0036	Mycobacterium tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria isolates from HIV-infected patients in Guangxi, China	BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of death among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected persons. The prevalence of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in HIV-infected patients in China is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of M. tuberculosis and NTM in HIV-infected patients in Guangxi Province, determine their drug resistance profiles, and evaluate the genotype patterns of M. tuberculosis strains. DESIGN: Samples were collected from two HIV-designated hospitals in Guangxi Province between 2005 and 2008. HIV-infected patients who were culture-positive for mycobacteria were included. Drug susceptibility testing was performed for mycobacterial isolates. NTM species was identified by sequencing, and M. tuberculosis isolates were genotyped using the variable number of tandem repeats method. RESULTS: M. tuberculosis and NTM were identified in respectively 117 (53%) and 102 (47%) HIV-infected patients. Drug resistance was found in 27% and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in 11% of the patients with TB. Previous treatment for TB was significantly associated with MDR-TB. Twenty (17%) TB patients belonged to eight VNTR-defined clusters. CONCLUSION: The high frequency of NTM among HIV-infected patients raises concerns about accurate species identification before the determination of appropriate treatment. The potential for TB transmission exists among HIV-infected patients. Intensified screening and effective treatment of TB-HIV co-infected patients is urgently needed.	tuberculosis; non-tuberculous mycobacteria; human immunodeficiency virus; China	BEIJING GENOTYPE STRAINS; GENETIC DIVERSITY; IDENTIFICATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DISEASE; PREVALENCE; SPECIMENS
10.1017_S0950268810003158	Anti-tuberculosis drug resistance patterns and trends in a tuberculosis referral hospital, 1997-2009	Information about the changing epidemiology of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in hospitals in China over the past decade remains largely unknown. This study examined the susceptibility patterns and trends of drug-resistant TB cases in the 309 Hospital in Beijing, China. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were retrospectively identified, drug susceptibility test (DST) results and clinical data were analysed for the period 1997-2009. Of the 5523 culture-positive TB patients, 47.1% had resistance to any anti-TB drug, 14.8% had mono-resistant TB, 19.8% had poly-resistant TB, 19.4% had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), and 1.3% had extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). Drug-resistant TB was significantly associated with age group, residential situation, and TB treatment history (P<0.001). During 1997-2000, the percentage of TB patients with any resistance, mono-resistant TB, poly-resistant TB, MDR-TB and XDR-TB all increased significantly (P<0.001). During 2000-2003, the increasing trends of MDR-TB and XDR-TB cases were reversed. During 2004-2009, the percentage of TB patients with any resistance, mono-resistant TB, poly-resistant TB, MDR-TB and XDR-TB all declined significantly (P<0.001), but the prevalence of MDR-TB and poly-resistant TB cases remained high. Our study provides evidence demonstrating that intensive TB control measures have helped reverse the increasing trends of drug-resistant TB in China, but continuous surveillance of drug-resistant TB and better case management are still needed to further reduce the remaining high prevalence of drug-resistant TB.

pub-1282	Antitubercular Drug Resistance in Four Healthcare Facilities in North India	Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public-health problem in India, having the highest number of incident and multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB cases. The study was carried out to appraise the prevalence of first-line anti-TB drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and its patterns among different types of TB patients from different settings in a province of North India. Of 3,704 clinical specimens, 345 (9.3%) were culture-positive, and drug-susceptibility testing was carried out for 301 MTB strains. A high level of primary and acquired drug resistance of MTB was observed in the region studied, with weighted mean of 10.5% and 28.08%, 12.81% and 29.72%, 17.12% and 29.94%, 11.97% and 27.84%, and 10.74% and 23.54% for rifampicin, isoniazid streptomycin, ethambutol-resistant and MDR cases respectively. Drug resistance was significantly higher in pulmonary (p=0.014) and acquired drug-resistant TB cases (p<0.001). Any drug resistance (p=0.002) and MDR TB were significantly (p=0.009) associated with HIV-seropositive cases. An urgent plan is needed to continuously monitor the transmission trends of drug-resistant strains, especially MDR-TB strains, in the region.

10.1016_j.jhin.2011.06.017	Tuberculosis infection control in rural South Africa: survey of knowledge, attitude and practice in hospital staff	A baseline assessment of tuberculosis infection control (TB IC) knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) was conducted among staff in a resource-limited rural South African hospital where nosocomially transmitted multi-and extensively drug-resistant (M/XDR) TB had been reported. Assessment consisted of anonymous questionnaires and direct observation during July-September 2007, soon after the report of M/XDR-TB. Data were obtained from 57 questionnaires and 10 h of direct observation. While knowledge and attitudes were generally supportive of TB IC implementation, 49.1% of staff felt that the hospital did not care about them and/or was not working to prevent staff TB infections, and 42.9% were less willing to continue as a healthcare worker because of staff TB/MDR-TB/XDR-TB deaths. Practices were variable. The recent appointment of an IC officer and implementation of natural ventilation were strengths, but the facility lacked a TB IC policy, the patient TB screening process was inadequate, and 41.5% of respondents were unaware of their personal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status. Respondents reported a number of barriers to TB IC implementation such as concerns about the confidentiality of staff health information, the stigma of TB and HIV, inadequate resources, and patient non-compliance. Assessment of staff KAP provided useful data regarding deficits and barriers to TB IC, and helped to focus subsequent IC strategies. Given the critical importance of reducing nosocomial TB transmission, it is recommended that facilities should conduct simplified TB IC assessment, ensure the confidentiality of staff health information, address the stigma of TB/HIV, and implement multi-faceted TB IC facility and behavioural change interventions. Behavioural science methods have the potential to improve TB IC research and implementation. (C) 2011 The Healthcare Infection Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.5897_AJMR11.358	Rapid detection of rpoB and katG genes from the sputum of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-direct sequencing analysis	Rapid diagnosis of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) plays a role in guiding standardized treatment regimen. Traditional drug susceptibility (DST) testing takes about six to eight weeks. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to characterize the mutations in rpoB and katG genes from the sputum specimens of MDR-TB by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-direct sequencing analysis and to diagnose the MDR-TB as soon as earlier. The sensitivity and specificity of this molecular DST would be assessed further. Rpob and katG genes were detected directly from the clinical sputum specimens of inpatients with MDR-TB by PCR-direct sequencing. The sensitivity, specificity of rpoB and katG gene for 48 specimens was as follows: 95.8, 100% and 93.75, 97.9%, respectively. Our study demonstrated that PCR-direct sequencing analysis was a rapid, sensitive and specific molecular approach for the mutation detection of rpoB and katG genes that are associated with multidrug-resistance clinical sputum specimens within 48 h of receipt, which is more rapid than drug susceptibility testing after the bacillus culture.

10.1371_journal.pone.0027610	Factors Associated with Anti-Tuberculosis Medication Adverse Effects: A Case-Control Study in Lima, Peru	Background: Long-term exposure to anti-tuberculosis medication increases risk of adverse drug reactions and toxicity. The objective of this investigation was to determine factors associated with anti-tuberculosis adverse drug reactions in Lima, Peru, with special emphasis on MDR-TB medication, HIV infection, diabetes, age and tobacco use. Methodology and Results: A case-control study was performed using information from Peruvian TB Programme. A case was defined as having reported an anti-TB adverse drug reaction during 2005-2010 with appropriate notification on clinical records. Controls were defined as not having reported a side effect, receiving anti-TB therapy during the same time that the case had appeared. Crude, and age-and sex-adjusted models were calculated using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A multivariable model was created to look for independent factors associated with side effect from anti-TB therapy. A total of 720 patients (144 cases and 576 controls) were analyzed. In our multivariable model, age, especially those over 40 years (OR = 3.93; 95% CI: 1.65-9.35), overweight/obesity (OR = 2.13; 95% CI: 1.17-3.89), anemia (OR = 2.10; IC95%: 1.13-3.92), MDR-TB medication (OR = 11.1; 95% CI: 6.29-19.6), and smoking (OR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.03-3.87) were independently associated with adverse drug reactions. Conclusions: Old age, anemia, MDR-TB medication, overweight/obesity status, and smoking history are independent risk factors associated with anti-tuberculosis adverse drug reactions. Patients with these risk factors should be monitored during the anti-TB therapy. A comprehensive clinical history and additional medical exams, including hematocrit and HIV-ELISA, might be useful to identify these patients.		DRUG-INDUCED HEPATOTOXICITY; TUBERCULOSIS
10.1371_journal.pone.0026659	Operational Challenges in Diagnosing Multi-Drug Resistant TB and Initiating Treatment in Andhra Pradesh, India	Background: Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP), Andhra Pradesh, India. There is limited information on whether MDR-TB suspects are identified, undergo diagnostic assessment and are initiated on treatment according to the programme guidelines. Objectives: To assess i) using the programme definition, the number and proportion of MDR-TB suspects in a large cohort of TB patients on first-line treatment under RNTCP ii) the proportion of these MDR-TB suspects who underwent diagnosis for MDR-TB and iii) the number and proportion of those diagnosed as MDR-TB who were successfully initiated on treatment. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis, by reviewing RNTCP records and reports, was conducted in four districts of Andhra Pradesh, India, among patients registered for first line treatment during October 2008 to December 2009. Results: Among 23,999 TB patients registered for treatment there were 559 (2%) MDR-TB suspects (according to programme definition) of which 307 (55%) underwent diagnosis and amongst these 169 (55%) were found to be MDR-TB. Of the MDR-TB patients, 112 (66%) were successfully initiated on treatment. Amongst those eligible for MDR-TB services, significant proportions are lost during the diagnostic and treatment initiation pathway due to a variety of operational challenges. The programme needs to urgently address these challenges for effective delivery and utilisation of the MDR-TB services.		TUBERCULOSIS
pub-1287	In vitro efficacy of acetohydroxyacid synthase inhibitors against clinical strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from a hospital in Beijing, China	Objectives: To assess the efficacy of acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) inhibitors against Mycobacterium tuberculosis from China, including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) strains. Methods: In this study, the tube dilution method and Middlebrook 7H10 agar media were used to describe the in vitro efficacy of 3 AHAS inhibitors (sulfometuron methyl, monosulfuron, and monosulfuron-ester) against H37Rv and 26 clinical isolates, which include MDR-TB and XDR-TB strains, from the 309th Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA 309), Beijing, China. Cytotoxity of these compounds were then evaluated using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2y1] -2,5-dipheny tetrazolium bromide assay with HBE cell. All the experiments were performed from January 2010 to November 2010 in the Department of Clinical Laboratory of the PLA 309 hospital. Results: Sulfometuron methyl (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] range, 8-16 mg/L), monosulfuronester (MIC range, 8-16 mg/L), and monosulfuron (MIC range, 16-64 mg/L) showed significant activity against all Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains tested in this study in vitro, and they exhibited the same degree of activity against MDR and XDR isolates with that shown against the susceptible strains. All 3 compounds showed little cytotoxicity, with an IC50 against HBE cells greater than 300 mg/L. Conclusion: The results suggest that AHAS could serve as a target protein for the development of novel anti-TB therapeutics in China.

pub-1290	TUBERCULOSIS TREATMENT WITH MOBILE-PHONE MEDICATION REMINDERS IN NORTHERN THAILAND	Thailand's implementation of the Directly Observed Treatment, Short course (DOTS) strategy to increase tuberculosis (TB) control program efficacy has not achieved the World Health Organization (WHO) TB key targets. We defined two TB control models in the study. Patients in Model 1 were treated with a conventional DOTS strategy and in Model 2, patients were treated the same as Model method 1 but were given a phone call reminder to take their medication. Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and non-MDR-TB patients were randomized into either Model 1 or 2. Treatment outcomes were given as cure rates, completion rates, failure rates or success rates at 18 months in the MDR-TB group and 6 months in the non-MDR-TB group. The sputum conversion rate at 1 month were evaluated for both groups. In the MDR-TB group, the sputum conversion rate was 20% (95% CI 8-45) in Model 1 and 90% (95% CI 73-98) in Model 2 (p<0.001). In the non-MDR-TB group, the sputum conversion rate was 52% (95% CI 36-70) in Model 1 and 37% (95% CI 22-56) in Model 2 although the difference was not significant (p=0.221). The Model 2 success rates were significantly higher (73.7%, 96.7%) in both the MDR-TB and non-MDR-TB groups (p<0.001, p=0.047). The MDR-TB rate in northern Thailand decreased from 4.1% during April-September 2008 to 1.8% during April-September 2009. Further study of the association between implementation of Model 2 and MDR-TB incidence reduction needs to be carried out.	tuberculosis; DOTS; MDR-TB; phone call reminder	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE
pub-1291	Composition of Three Essential Oils, and their Mammalian Cell Toxicity and Antimycobacterial Activity against Drug Resistant-Tuberculosis and Nontuberculous Mycobacteria Strains	Tuberculosis (TB) is the most ancient epidemic disease in the world and a serious opportunistic disease in HIV/AIDS patients. The increase in multidrug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB, XDR-TB) demands the search for novel antimycobacterial drugs. Essential oils (EOs) have been widely used in medicine and some EOs and their major components have been shown to be active against M. tuberculosis. The aim of this work was to evaluate the antimycobacterial and cell toxicity activities of three EOs derived from Salvia aratocensis, Turnera diffusa and Lippia americana, aromatics plants collected in Colombia. The EOs were isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC/MS techniques. The EOs were tested against 15 Mycobacterium spp using a colorimetric macrodilution method and against mammalian Vero and THP-1 cells by MTT. The activity was expressed as minimal concentration in mu g/mL that inhibits growth, and the concentration that is cytotoxic for 50 or 90% of the cells (CC(50) and CC(90)). The major components were epi-alpha-cadinol (20.1%) and 1,10-di-epi-cubenol (14.2%) for Salvia aratocensis; drima-7,9(11)-diene (22.9%) and viridiflorene (6.6%) for Turnera diffusa; and germacrene D (15.4%) and trans-beta- caryophyllene (11.3%) for Lippia americana. The most active EO was obtained from S. aratocensis, with MIC values below 125 mu g mL(-1) for M. tuberculosis Beijing genotype strains, and 200 to 500 mu g mL(-1) for nontuberculous mycobacterial strains. The EOs were either partially or non toxic to Vero and THP-1 mammalian cells with CC(50) values from 30 to CC(90)>100 mu g mL(-1), and a CC(90)>100 mu g The EOs obtained from the three aromatic Colombian plants are an important source of potential compounds against TB. Future studies using the major EO components are recommended.	antimycobacterial; essential oil; tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; Beijing genotype; mammalian cell toxicity	TURNERA-DIFFUSA WILLD.; NATURAL-PRODUCTS; IN-VITRO; ANTIBACTERIAL; LIPPIA; OPPORTUNITIES; COMPONENTS; DISCOVERY
10.1016_j.rppneu.2011.06.008	Tuberculosis Unit: Case Study of 10 years of activity (1999-2009)	Introduction: The Pulmonology Service of a Central Hospital in Lisbon created a Unit dedicated to the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). Objectives: Casuistic analysis and assessment of the predictive factors for in-hospital mortality, over a 10-years period. Material/Methods: Retrospective study, from April 1999 to September 2009, through the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences application for binary logistic regression. Results: In a total of 1917 patients, most were male (n = 1450; 76%), Caucasian (76.6%), with an average age of 43 +/- 15.2 years, and 19.8% were immigrants. The retreatments were responsible for 26% of the hospitalizations. The presence of comorbidities was detected in 85.7%, particularly HIV infection (34.7%). The multidrug-resistant (MDR) and the extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB occurred in 6.6% and 6.8%, respectively. The average delay was 28.5 +/- 54.8 days, with the mortality rate at 8.6%. The mortality risk was more significant amongst men (OR 1.8; 95%Cl 1.16-2.90; p < 0.01), in patients with HIV infection (OR 3.7; 95%Cl 2.47-5.49; p < 0.001), and amongst those who presented MDR TB (OR 2.5; 95%Cl 1.24-5.15; p < 0.01) and XDR TB (OR 5.5; 95%Cl 3.14-9.58; p < 0.001). Conclusions: A high percentage of patients presented comorbidities, namely HIV infection. The main factors associated with mortality were HIV infection, XDR TB and MDR TB.

10.1371_journal.pone.0026675	Analogous Mechanisms of Resistance to Benzothiazinones and Dinitrobenzamides in Mycobacterium smegmatis	Tuberculosis is still a leading cause of death worldwide. The selection and spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant strains (XDR-TB) is a severe public health problem. Recently, two different classes of chemical series, the benzothiazinones (BTZ) and the dinitrobenzamide (DNB) derivatives have been found to be highly active against M. tuberculosis, including XDR-TB strains. The target of BTZs is DprE1 protein which works in concert with DprE2 to form the heteromeric decaprenylphosphoryl-beta-D-ribose 2'-epimerase, involved in Decaprenyl-Phospho-Arabinose (DPA) biosynthesis. Interestingly, it has been shown that the DNBs block the same pathway thus suggesting that both drugs could share the same target. Moreover, in Mycobacterium smegmatis the overexpression of the NfnB nitroreductase led to the inactivation of the BTZs by reduction of a critical nitro-group to an amino-group. In this work several spontaneous M. smegmatis mutants resistant to DNBs were isolated. Sixteen mutants, showing high levels of DNB resistance, exhibited a mutation in the Cys394 of DprE1. Using fluorescence titration and mass spectrometry it has been possible to monitor the binding between DprE1 and DNBs, achieving direct evidence that MSMEG_6382 is the cellular target of DNBs in mycobacteria. Additionally, M. smegmatis mutants having low levels of resistance to DNBs harbor various mutations in MSMEG_6503 gene encoding the transcriptional repressor of the nitroreductase NfnB. By LC/MS(2) analysis it has been demonstrated that NfnB is responsible for DNB inactivation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that both DNB and BTZ drugs share common resistance mechanisms in M. smegmatis.		D-RIBOSE 2'-EPIMERASE; CURRENT CHALLENGES; TUBERCULOSIS; ARABINAN
10.1017_S0950268810002797	Assessing spatiotemporal patterns of multidrug-resistant and drug-sensitive tuberculosis in a South American setting	We examined the spatiotemporal distribution of laboratory-confirmed multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) cases and that of other TB cases in Lima, Peru with the aim of identifying mechanisms responsible for the rise of MDR TB in an urban setting. All incident cases of TB in two districts of Lima, Peru during 2005-2007 were included. The spatiotemporal distributions of MDR cases and other TB cases were compared with Ripley's K statistic. Of 11 711 notified cases, 1187 received drug susceptibility testing and 376 were found to be MDR. Spatial aggregation of patients with confirmed MDR disease appeared similar to that of other patients in 2005 and 2006; however, in 2007, cases with confirmed MDR disease were found to be more tightly grouped. Subgroup analysis suggests the appearance of resistance may be driven by increased transmission. Interventions should aim to reduce the infectious duration for those with drug-resistant disease and improve infection control.

10.5588_ijtld.11.0067	Implementation of the INNO-LiPA Rif.TB (R) line-probe assay in rapid detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Latvia	SETTING : In Latvia, 11% of tuberculosis (TB) patients have multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). The INNO-LiPA Rif.TB (R) line-probe assay (LPA) detects rifampin (RMP) resistance and may accelerate the time to effective MDR-TB treatment. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of LPA on time to diagnosis, initiation of treatment, sputum culture conversion and treatment outcome. DESIGN: From October 2004 to September 2006, we performed LPA and drug susceptibility testing (DST) using BACTEC and Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) media among all individuals at risk for MDR-TB compared to a 2003 cohort of 48 MDR-TB patients detected by BACTEC. RESULTS: In a total of 107 sputum smear-positive individuals at risk for MDR-TB, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated from 85; 23 were RMP-resistant on LJ compared to 22 on LPA (96% sensitivity). There was a significant difference in the mean time between specimen collection and LPA result (10.0 days) and BACTEC DST result (17.0 days, P = 0.0005) in the LPA cohort. The LPA cohort achieved culture conversion a median of 105 days after treatment initiation vs. a median of 88.5 days (P = 0.54) in the BACTEC cohort. There was no difference in the proportion achieving culture conversion (P = 0.54) or in treatment outcome (P = 0.65). CONCLUSION: LPA accelerated empiric treatment, but did not reduce the time to culture conversion or improve the rate of culture conversion or treatment outcome.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; line-probe assay; rapid detection	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; RIFAMPIN RESISTANCE; CLINICAL SPECIMENS; DIAGNOSIS; IDENTIFICATION; COUNTRIES; METAANALYSIS; VALIDATION; CULTURE; COST
10.5588_ijtld.11.0101	Frequency and type of microbiological monitoring of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment	Monthly culture is usually recommended to monitor treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). As mycobacterial laboratory capacity is limited in many settings, TB programs need evidence to decide whether monthly cultures are necessary compared to other approaches. We simulated three alternative monitoring strategies (culture every 2 or 3 months, and monthly smears alone) in a cohort of MDR-TB patients in Estonia, Latvia, Philippines, Russia and Peru from 2000 to 2004. This retrospective analysis illustrated that less frequent testing delays confirmation of bacteriological conversion. This would prolong intensive treatment, hospitalization and respiratory isolation, increasing cost and toxicity. After conversion, less frequent testing could delay diagnosis of possible treatment failure.	MDR-TB; monitoring; treatment response; culture conversion	
10.5588_ijtld.10.0679	Predictors of delayed culture conversion in patients treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Pakistan	Culture conversion is an interim monitoring tool for treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). We evaluated the time to and predictors of culture conversion in pulmonary MDR-TB patients enrolled in the community-based MDR-TB management program at the Indus Hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. Despite strict daily directly observed therapy, monthly food incentives and patient counseling, the median time to culture conversion SUMMARY was 196 days (range 32-471). The cumulative probabilities of culture conversion by 2, 4, 6 and 12 months were respectively 6%, 33%, 47%, and 73%. Smoking, high smear grade at baseline and previous use of second-line drugs delayed culture conversion.	MDR-TB; drug-resistant TB; culture conversion; Pakistan	
10.1371_journal.pone.0026276	High Prevalence of Primary Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis in Persons with No Known Risk Factors	Introduction: In high multidrug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) prevalence areas, drug susceptibility testing (DST) at diagnosis is recommended for patients with risk factors for MDR. However, this approach might miss a substantial proportion of MDR-TB in the general population. We studied primary MDR in patients considered to be at low risk of MDR-TB in Lima, Peru. Methods: We enrolled new sputum smear-positive TB patients who did not report any MDR-TB risk factor: known exposure to a TB patient whose treatment failed or who died or who was known to have MDR-TB; immunosuppressive co-morbidities, ex prison inmates; prison and health care workers; and alcohol or drug abuse. A structured questionnaire was applied to all enrolled participants to confirm the absence of these factors and thus minimize underreporting. Sputum from all participants was cultured on Lowenstein-Jensen media and DST for first line drugs was performed using the 7H10 agar method. Results: Of 875 participants with complete data, 23.2% (203) had risk factors for MDR-TB elicited after enrolment. Among the group with no reported risk factors who had a positive culture, we found a 6.3% (95% CI 4.4-8.3) (37/584) rate of MDR-TB. In this group no epidemiological characteristics were associated with MDR-TB. Thus, in this group, multidrug resistance occurred in patients with no identifiable risk factors. Conclusions: We found a high rate of primary MDR-TB in a general population with no identifiable risk factors for MDR-TB. This suggests that in a high endemic area targeting patients for MDR-TB based on the presence of risk factors is an insufficient intervention.		
pub-1300	Survey of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in Iran-Tehran: A retrospective study	The emergence and spread of multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR) has raised public health concern about global control of TB. Our objective was to estimate the incidence of XDR-TB as compared to susceptible controls from TB patients in Tehran-Iran between 2006 and 2009. Sputum culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) was done for patients with known or suspected TB. The strains that were identified as MDR were subjected to susceptibility testing for second-line drugs. Of 1126 culture-positive cases with first line drug susceptibility test, 91(8.08%) were Non-tuberculosis (Atypical) isolates, 8(0.7%) M. bovis and 1027(91.2%) M. tuberculosis. We detected MDR-TB in 26 patients (2.5%), of whom 2(7.7%) had XDR-TB. One of the XDR-TB patients with positive HIV infection died. This study cannot give an indication of XDR-TB rates in Iran. However, the results of this study document the existence of XDR-TB in Iran and indicate a need for surveillance data to define the magnitude and trends of this serious, contagious disease.

10.1371_journal.pone.0025861	Self-Reported Risks for Multiple-Drug Resistance among New Tuberculosis Cases: Implications for Drug Susceptibility Screening and Treatment	Background: Multiple drug-resistance in new tuberculosis (TB) cases accounts for the majority of all multiple drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) worldwide. Effective control requires determining which new TB patients should be tested for MDR disease, yet the effectiveness of global screening recommendations of high-risk groups is unknown. Methods: Sixty MDR-TB cases with no history of previous TB treatment, 80 drug-sensitive TB and 80 community-based controls were recruited in Lima, Peru between August and December, 2008 to investigate whether recommended screening practices identify individuals presenting with MDR-TB. Odd ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using logistic regression to study the association of potential risk factors with case/control variables. Results: MDR-TB cases did not differ from drug-sensitive TB and community controls in rates of human immunodeficiency virus infection, reported hospital or prison visits in the 3 years prior to diagnosis. MDR-TB cases were more likely than drug-sensitive TB controls to have had a recent MDR-TB household contact (OR 4.66, (95% CI 1.56-13.87)); however, only 15 cases (28.3%) reported this exposure. In multivariate modeling, recent TB household contact, but not contact with an MDR-TB case, remained predictive of MDR-TB, OR 7.47, (95% CI 1.91-29.3). Living with a partner rather than parents was associated with a lower risk of MDR-TB, OR 0.15, (95% CI 0.04-0.51). Conclusion: Targeted drug susceptibility testing (DST) linked to reported MDR-TB contact or other high-risk exposures does not identify the majority of new TB cases with MDR disease in Lima where it is endemic. All new TB cases should be screened with DST to identify MDR patients. These findings are likely applicable to other regions with endemic MDR-TB.

10.1371_journal.pone.0025698	How Do Patients Who Fail First-Line TB Treatment but Who Are Not Placed on an MDR-TB Regimen Fare in South India?	Setting: Seven districts in Andhra Pradesh, South India Objectives: To a) determine treatment outcomes of patients who fail first line anti-TB treatment and are not placed on an multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) regimen, and b) relate the treatment outcomes to culture and drug susceptibility patterns (C&DST). Design: Retrospective cohort study using routine programme data and Mycobacterium TB Culture C&DST between July 2008 and December 2009. Results: There were 202 individuals given a re-treatment regimen and included in the study. Overall treatment outcomes were: 68 (34%) with treatment success, 84 (42%) failed, 36 (18%) died, 13 (6.5%) defaulted and 1 transferred out. Treatment success for category I and II failures was low at 37%. In those with positive cultures, 81 had pan-sensitive strains with 31 (38%) showing treatment success, while 61 had drug-resistance strains with 9 (15%) showing treatment success. In 58 patients with negative cultures, 28 (48%) showed treatment success. Conclusion: Treatment outcomes of patients who fail a first-line anti-TB treatment and who are not placed on an MDR-TB regimen are unacceptably poor. The worst outcomes are seen among category II failures and those with negative cultures or drug-resistance. There are important programmatic implications which need to be addressed.

pub-1303	Drug resistance and Susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis identified at University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre	Objective: The prime objective of the study was to evaluate drug resistance and susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated at University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre. Methodology: A total number of 726 specimens in the form of sputum and bronchial lavage obtained from patients suspected to tuberculosis were analysed for confirmatory identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing. The bacteria was identified initially by culture and staining and finally by BDProbeTec (TM) ET Mycobacteria kits (2008). All Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility against streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol using BACTEC (TM) MGIT (TM) 960 system. Results: Out of 726 specimens 16 (32.65%) were identified as mono drug resistance 7 (14.29%) as poly drug resistance, 4 (8.16%) as multi-drug resistance (MDR-TB). Identified TB bacteria were analysed in the light of sources of samples where brief history of the patients' age, gender and community noted. Conclusion: Bacteriologic testing with antibiotic sensitivity, standardized treatment with supervision and patient support, provision and management of the drugs used in treatment are necessary for effective treatment of tuberculosis.

10.1016_j.rmr.2010.10.040	Multidrug resistant tuberculosis - its extent, hazard and possible solutions	Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has spread to most regions of the world and represents a serious threat to the success of the struggle against tuberculosis. It can result from errors in management that favour the selection of drug resistant organisms and can in the worst case lead to the development of extremely resistant organisms (XDR-TB) which are practically untreatable. The current strategies for combating this problem are, on the one hand, the rapid identification and tracking of resistant strains using molecular genetic techniques and, on the other hand, careful drug management in individual cases using second line agents. At the level of public health, the most important measures are those which prevent or correct the processes which can drive the creation of new cases of MDR-TB. This can have implications for the modification and development of national strategies. The future of the fight against tuberculosis depends in part on the success of strategies to combat the development and spread of MDR-TB. (C) 2011 SPLF. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

10.3201_eid1710.110546	Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis, People's Republic of China, 2007-2009	We conducted a case-control study to investigate risk factors for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) in the People's Republic of China. Genotyping analysis was used to estimate the percentage of cases from recent transmission among 100 MDR TB case-patients hospitalized during April 2007-July 2009. Molecular subtyping of isolates showed that 41% of MDR TB strains clustered. Beijing genotype was found in 94% of the MDR TB isolates and 79% of the pan-susceptible isolates. In multivariate analysis, MDR TB was independently associated with Beijing genotype, retreatment for TB, symptoms lasting >= 3 months before first evaluation at the hospital, lack of health insurance, and being a farmer (vs. being a student). MDR TB was associated with Beijing genotype and lower socioeconomic status. A large percentage of MDR TB cases seemed to result from recent transmission. Early detection, effective treatment, and infection control measures for MDR TB are needed to reduce transmission.

10.1002_jcb.23232	The Interaction Topology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Genes Response to Capreomycin and Novel Clues for More Drug Targets	The resurgence of tuberculosis (TB) and emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) are significant obstacles to stop TB treatment. Capreomycin (CPM) is regarded as an ideal second-line treatment for TB as well as for MDR-TB. However, the inexorable emergence of capreomycin resistant TB cases accentuates the urgent need for more detailed characterization of CPM targets. Most of these are single gene mutation, such as those involved in the complex formation of ribosomal 30S initiation, inhibit protein synthesis, affect 50S ribosomal protein L10, control transcription and translation of operon rpIJL-rpoBC. A new paradigm integrating gene, small metabolites, protein and underlying signaling pathway to shed light on the physiology, pathogenesis, and network of pathogen response is emerging. This model holds great promise to unravel the intricacy of drug action. However, to our knowledge, no such work regarding Mycobacterium tuberculosis response to capreomycin exposure was ever reported. We employed the data mining to construct an interaction topology of M. tuberculosis genes response to capreomycin. Most valuable genes were summarized for further experimental validation based on this topology. Dampening the virulence factors and respiratory of M. tuberculosis might be the new targets of CPM beyond Rv1364c, pe_pgrs38, pe_pgrs51 which are the salient nodes of the network and represent most promising new capreomycin targets meriting further exploration. This work will facilitate further investigation of capreomycin targets against M. tuberculosis and be conducive to novel TB drug discovery. J. Cell. Biochem. 112: 2716-2720, 2011.

10.1099_jmm.0.032292_0	Improved rapid molecular diagnosis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis using a new reverse hybridization assay, REBA MTB-MDR	Rapid diagnosis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is essential for the prompt initiation of effective second-line therapy to improve treatment outcome and limit transmission of this obstinate disease. A variety of molecular methods that enable the rapid detection of mutations implicated in MDR-TB have been developed. The sensitivity of the methods is dependent, in principle, on the repertoire of mutations being detected, which is typically limited to mutations in the genes rpoB, katG and the promoter region of inhA. In this study, a new reverse hybridization assay, REBA MTB-MDR (M&D), that probes mutations in the oxyR-ahpC intergenic region, in addition to those in rpoB, katG and the inhA promoter region, was evaluated. A set of 240 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from patients receiving retreatment regimens was subjected to conventional phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing (DST) and the REBA MTB-MDR assay. The nucleotide sequences of the loci known to be involved in drug resistance were determined for comparison. In brief, the results showed that the REBA MTB-MDR assay efficiently recognized nucleotide changes in the oxyR-ahpC intergenic region as well as those in rpoB, katG and the inhA promoter region with higher sensitivity, resulting in an 81.0% detection rate for isoniazid resistance. Inclusion of the oxyR-ahpC intergenic region in the REBA MTB-MDR assay improved the overall sensitivity of molecular DST for MDR-TB from 73.1 to 79.9%.

10.5588_ijtld.10.0221	Bacteriologic monitoring of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients in five DOTS-Plus pilot projects	BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis programs in DOTS-Plus pilot sites in five countries. OBJECTIVES: To calculate sputum conversion time and its relationship to treatment outcome, document the frequency of culture reversions and examine concordance of smear and culture to assess the potential consequences of monitoring by smear microscopy alone. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis of 1926 patients receiving individualized, second-line therapy. RESULTS: Among 1385 sputum culture-positive cases at baseline, 1146 (83%) experienced at least one culture conversion during treatment. Conversion, however, was not sustained in all patients: 201 (15%) experienced initial culture conversion and at least one subsequent culture reversion to positive; 1064 (77%) achieved sustained culture conversion. Median time to culture conversion was 3 months. Among 206 patients whose final conversion occurred 7-18 months after the initiation of therapy, 71% were cured or had completed treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged treatment for patients with delayed conversion may be beneficial, as 71% of late converters still achieved cure or completed treatment. This has implications for programs with defined end points for treatment failure. The interval between first and final conversion among patients whose initial conversion is not sustained raises concern with respect to the ongoing debate regarding duration of treatment and the definition of cure.

OBJECTIVE: To study the profile of TB among household contacts of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients. DESIGN: In a cross-sectional study, contacts of MDR-TB patients were traced and clinical, radiological, bacteriological and pulmonary function tests were performed for evidence of TB infection and active disease. RESULTS: Between January 2005 and December 2008, 58 of 92 index MDR-TB patients could be traced. Of 302 contacts who could be studied, 16 (5.29%) developed TB: nine had pulmonary and seven had extra-pulmonary disease; two (0.66%) had MDR-TB. Of the 302 contacts, 137 reported to the LRS Institute and were investigated. The most common symptoms observed were cough, chest pain and fever. The tuberculin skin test was positive in 109 of 135 (80.7%) contacts; among these, bacille Calmette-Guerin scar was present in 86. Pulmonary function tests revealed obstruction, restriction and mixed abnormalities. CONCLUSION: The majority of contacts of MDR-TB patients had drug-susceptible TB and the rate of MDR-TB was very low. Evaluation of contacts of MDR-TB cases may lead to early diagnosis and prevention of TB.	tuberculosis; household contacts; MDR-TB	INFECTION; DISEASE

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of the Sputnik intervention on patient default rates. DESIGN: We analyzed the characteristics of patients referred to the program, treatment adherence of Sputnik program enrollees before and during the intervention, and final outcomes for all patients referred to the Sputnik program. RESULTS: For patients continuing their existing regimens after referral to the program (n = 46), mean adherence to treatment increased by 56% (from 52% of prescribed doses prior to enrolment to 81%). For patients initiating new regimens after referral (n = 5), mean adherence was 83%. Mean adherence for patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB; n = 38) was 79% and for all others (n = 13) it was 89%. The cure rate was 71.1% for patients with MDR-TB, 60% for all others and 68% in the program overall. CONCLUSION: The Sputnik intervention was successful in reducing rates of treatment default among patients at high risk for non-adherence.	treatment adherence; patient-centered; MDR-TB; Tomsk; Russia	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; DIRECTLY OBSERVED THERAPY; RISK-FACTORS; MDR-TB; INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT; FOLLOW-UP; RUSSIA; TOMSK; POPULATION; MORTALITY
10.1016_j.ejmech.2011.07.052	New fluorine-containing hydrazones active against MDR-tuberculosis	Several new fluorine-containing hydrazones were synthesized and screened for their in vitro anti-mycobacterial activity. Nine of these derivatives have shown a remarkable activity against MDR-TB strain with MIC 0.5 mu g/mL and high value of selectivity index (SI). Compound 3h with the highest SI (1268.58) was used for stability evaluation with putative metabolites (ciprofloxacin and formylciprofloxacin) detection. Compound 3h was stable at pH 7.4 of aqueous buffer and rat plasma, in acidic buffers (at pH 3 and 5) slow decomposition was observed. Interestingly, no formylciprofloxacin was detected in the solution, and only slightly increased concentration of ciprofloxacin was observed instead. Trifluoromethyl hydrazones 3f and 3g exhibited the best activity also against two strains of Mycobacterium kansasii (MIC 1-4 mu mol/L). All evaluated compounds were found to be non-cytotoxic.

10.1093_infdis_jir460	Outbreaks of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis MDR Strains Induce High IL-17 T-Cell Response in Patients With MDR Tuberculosis That Is Closely Associated With High Antigen Load	Background. The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 17 (IL-17) plays an important role in immune responses but it is also associated with tissue-damaging inflammation. So, we evaluated the ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates to induce IL-17 in tuberculosis (TB) patients and in healthy human tuberculin reactors (PPD(+)HD). Methods. IL-17, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and interleukin 23 (IL-23) receptor expression were evaluated ex vivo and cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells from TB and PPD(+)HD stimulated with irradiated clinical isolates from multidrug resistant (MDR) outbreaks M (Haarlem family) and Ra (Latin American-Mediterranean family), as well as drug-susceptible isolates belonging to the same families and laboratory strain H37Rv for 48 hours in T-cell subsets by flow cytometry. Results. We observed that: (1) MDR strains M and Ra are stronger IL-17 inducers than drug-susceptible Mtb strains of the Haarlem and Latin American-Mediterranean families, (2) MDR-TB patients show the highest IL-17 expression that is independent on the strain, (3) IL-17 expression is dependent on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells associates with persistently high antigen load. Conclusions. IL-17--producing T cells could play an immunopathological role in MDR-TB promoting severe tissue damage, which may be associated with the low effectiveness of the second-line drugs employed in the treatment.

10.1186_1471_2334_11_255	Molecular detection of fluoroquinolone-resistance in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in Cambodia suggests low association with XDR phenotypes	Background: Drug susceptibility testing (DST) remains an important concern for implementing treatment of MDR tuberculosis patients. Implementation of molecular tests for drug resistance identification would facilitate DST particularly in developing countries where culturing is difficult to perform. We have characterized multidrug resistant strains in Cambodia using MDTDRsl tests, drug target sequencing and phenotypic tests. Methods: A total of 65 non-MDR and 101 MDR TB isolates collected between May 2007 and June 2009 were tested for resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides/cyclic peptides using the GenoType (R) MTBDRsl assay and gene sequencing. Rifampicin resistance (RMP-R) was tested using gene sequencing and genotyping was assessed by spoligotyping. Results: A total of 95 of the 101 MDR strains were confirmed to be RMP-R by rpoB gene sequencing. Fourteen of the 101 MDR isolates (14%) carried a gyrA mutation associated with fluoroquinolone-resistance (FQ-R) (detected by the MTBDRsl assay and sequencing) compared with only 1 (1.5%) of the 65 non-MDR strains. Only 1 (1%) of the MDR isolates was found to be XDR TB. The MDR group contained a higher proportion of Beijing or Beijing like strains (58%) than the non MDR group (28%). This percentage is higher in MDR FQ-R strains (71%). Conclusions: The new GenoType (R) MTBDRsl assay combined with molecular tests to detect RMP-R and isoniazid resistance (INH-R) represents a valuable tool for the detection of XDR TB. In Cambodia there is a low rate of XDR amongst MDR TB including MDR FQ-R TB. This suggests a low association between FQ-R and XDR TB. Strain spoligotyping confirms Beijing strains to be more prone to accumulate antibiotic resistance.

10.1164_rccm.201103_0397OC	Short-Course Chemotherapy with TMC207 and Rifapentine in a Murine Model of Latent Tuberculosis Infection	Rationale: Multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/XDR-TB) is an emerging global health threat. Proper management of close contacts of infectious patients is increasingly important. However, no evidence-based recommendations for treating latent TB infection (LTBI) after MDR/XDR-TB exposure (DR-LTBI) exist. An ultrashort regimen for LTBI caused by drug-susceptible strains (DS-LTBI) is also desirable. TMC207 has bactericidal and sterilizing activity in animal models of TB and improves the activity of current MDR-TB therapy in patients. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine whether TMC207 might enable short-course treatment of DR-LTBI and ultrashort treatment of DS-LTBI. Methods: Using an established experimental model of LTBI chemotherapy in which mice are aerosol-immunized with a recombinant bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine before low-dose aerosol infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the efficacy of TMC207 alone and in combination with rifapentine was compared with currently recommended control regimens as well as once-weekly rifapentine 1 isoniazid and daily rifapentine +/- isoniazid. Measurements: Outcomes included monthly lung colony-forming unit counts and relapse rates. Main Results: Lung colony-forming unit counts were stable at about 3.75 log(10) for up to 7.5 months postinfection in untreated mice. Rifamycin-containing regimens were superior to isoniazid monotherapy. TMC207 exhibited sterilizing activity at least as strong as that of rifampin alone and similar to that of rifampin 1 isoniazid, but daily rifapentine +/- isoniazid was superior to TMC207. Addition of TMC207 to rifapentine did not improve the sterilizing activity of rifapentine in this model. Conclusions: TMC207 has substantial sterilizing activity and may enable treatment of DR-LTBI in 3-4 months.	bacillus Calmette-Guerin; mouse; isoniazid; rifampin; pyrazinamide	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; ATP HOMEOSTASIS; PYRAZINAMIDE; R207910; MICE; LEVOFLOXACIN; MOXIFLOXACIN; PROPHYLAXIS; OFLOXACIN
10.1590_S0037_86822011000500020	Characterization of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis during pregnancy in Campinas, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, from 1995 to 2007	Introduction: There was a follow-up of pregnant women treated for multidrug-resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) during pregnancy in Campinas, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, from 1995 to 2007. Methods: In a retrospective study, patients with tuberculosis who were resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin and had pregnancy at any time during the treatment were included. The cases were individually treated, considering drug susceptibility test results and patients' prior treatments. Results: Seven cases presented resistance to two or more drugs. Three were already pregnant before the beginning of the treatment, and four conceived after. Two were with AIDS; one died, and the therapeutic program in the other one failed. All showed advanced tuberculosis with acute radiological findings, and the median sputum conversion time for five patients was four months. Two patients were cured. Two newborn babies were infected with HIV by their mothers. Conclusions: The outcome was unsatisfactory, and direct supervision is imperative in MDR-TB during pregnancy. The family planning program should be strongly recommended.	Tuberculosis; Multidrug resistance; Pregnancy	
pub-1318	Clinical data and molecular analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from drug-resistant tuberculosis patients in Goias, Brazil	Drug resistance is one of the major concerns regarding tuberculosis (TB) infection worldwide because it hampers control of the disease. Understanding the underlying mechanisms responsible for drug resistance development is of the highest importance. To investigate clinical data from drug-resistant TB patients at the Tropical Diseases Hospital, Goias (GO), Brazil and to evaluate the molecular basis of rifampin (R) and isoniazid (H) resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Drug susceptibility testing was performed on 124 isolates from 100 patients and 24 isolates displayed resistance to R and/or H. Molecular analysis of drug resistance was performed by partial sequencing of the rpoB and katG genes and analysis of the inhA promoter region. Similarity analysis of isolates was performed by 15 loci mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing. The molecular basis of drug resistance among the 24 isolates from 16 patients was confirmed in 18 isolates. Different susceptibility profiles among the isolates from the same individual were observed in five patients; using MIRU-VNTR, we have shown that those isolates were not genetically identical, with differences in one to three loci within the 15 analysed loci. Drug-resistant TB in GO is caused by M. tuberculosis strains with mutations in previously described sites of known genes and some patients harbour a mixed phenotype infection as a consequence of a single infective event; however, further and broader investigations are needed to support our findings.

10.1016_j.ejmech.2011.05.018	Design, synthesis and anti-tubercular evaluation of new 2-acylated and 2-alkylated amino-5-(4-(benzyloxy)phenyl)thiophene-3-carboxylic acid derivatives. Part 1	A series of 2-acylated and 2-alkylated amino-5-(4-(benzyloxy)phenyl)thiophene-3-carboxylic acid derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for anti-tubercular activity. Among these compounds, 10d, 15, 12h and 12k inhibited Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) growth with MIC values between 1.9 and 7.7 mu M and low toxicity against VERO cells. The four compounds were also tested against multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) clinical strains, which were found to show moderate activity. In addition, molecular docking simulation was performed to position compounds 10d, 15, 12h and 12k into mtFabH active site to predict the probable binding mode. These studies thus suggest that the designed 2-amino-5-phenylthiophene-3-carboxylic acid scaffold may serve as new promising template for further elaboration as anti-TB drugs.

pub-1320	DRUG SUSCEPTIBILITY PATTERNS OF MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES OF DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS AT SRINAGARIND HOSPITAL, A TERTIARY CARE CENTER IN NORTHEASTERN THAILAND	Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a major public health problem. The aim of this study was to assess the local susceptibility patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and clinical outcomes of drug resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) at Srinagarind Hospital, a tertiary care center in northeastern Thailand. Between January 2004 and December 2008, 1,052 patients had culture-proven M. tuberculosis infections at Srinagarind Hospital. M. tuberculosis was resistant to isoniazid (2.3%), rifampicin (2.8%), ethambutol (3.8%), streptomycin (2.1%), kanamycin (0.7%) and ofloxacin (1.9%). The occurrences of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) were 1.2% and 0.38%, respectively. Of the 65 DR-TB patients, complete medical records were found for 55. The male to female ratio was 2.2:1. The mean age was 50 years. Thirteen patients had MDR-TB. The duration of symptoms in the MDR-TB group was longer than the non-MDR-TB group, 11.6 months vs 2.6 months, respectively. Half of MDR-TB and one-third of non-MDR-TB patients had a previous history of being treated for tuberculosis. Nearly 20% of cases were HIV positive. Mono-drug resistance was initially treated with standard first-line drugs (CAT 1). The clinical course was more likely to be worse during the maintenance phase if there was resistance to rifampicin. Whenever there was resistance to two, three or four drugs, the antituberculosis drugs were prescribed based on susceptibility patterns. Only 30% of patients with MDR-TB and XDR-TB responded to treatment. Culture and sensitivity testing for M. tuberculosis cases is recommended in patients at high risk for DR-TB, such as patients previously treated for tuberculosis and those HIV positive.

10.1097_MJT.0b013e3181dd60ec	Revised Category II Regimen as an Alternative Strategy for Retreatment of Category I Regimen Failure and Irregular Treatment Cases	Currently, the Category (CAT) II regimen is recommended for patients who have failed the CAT I regimen. We have determined before that prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) is relatively high among these patients. On the other hand, the retreatment success rate with CAT II in CAT I treatment failures and defaults is nearly 50%. Therefore, we tried to find another strategy with a higher success rate. From January 2004 to November 2007, 105 patients with pulmonary TB, who failed a prior CAT I regimen or with more than one course of irregular anti-TB treatment, were included in this study, whereas five cases with nontuberculous mycobacteria were excluded. Drug susceptibility testing (DST), for first line anti-TB drugs, and polymerase chain reaction were performed. By the time of availability of DST that took 3 to 4 months, a pilot protocol consisted of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, ofloxacin, cycloserine, and amikacin was started. Then therapeutic regimen was adjusted based on four categories of DST pattern: sensitive, non-MDR pattern, MDR pattern, and culture-negative. Sensitive patients received the standard CAT I regimen, non-MDR patients an individualized regimen based on DST, MDR patients a standard second-line regimen, and culture-negatives a standard CAT I plus a 6-month injectable agent. Treatment outcomes were categorized and analyzed. Forty-eight patients with prior CAT I treatment failure and 52 with more than one irregular treatment courses were included in the analysis. Six percent of subjects had confirmed HIV infection. Seventy-two percent of subjects were assigned to a good outcome and 28% were assigned to a poor outcome group. Seventeen percent were culture-negative. Regarding DST pattern, 13% isolated strains were completely sensitive to first-line drugs. 53% strains were MDR, 10% monodrug-resistant, and 7% polydrug-resistant. There was no significant association between DST pattern and outcome (P = 0.13). The irregular regimen was associated with MDR TB as twice as CAT I regimen failure (69.2% versus 35.4%, P = 0.004). Patients with MDR TB significantly experienced more side effects than non-MDR-TBs (47% versus 27%, P = 0.102). Of 100 patients, 72% were cured, 5% abandoned treatment, 12% died, 6% were classified as treatment failures, 1% relapsed, and 5% were transferred out. Of 53 patients with MDR TB, 33 subjects were cured and seven died. All together, successful outcome was achieved in 62.2%, 76%, and 76% of MDR TB, non-MDR TB, and completely sensitive cases, respectively. A retreatment strategy based on DST and replacing the Category II regimen with an intermediate regimen called revised CAT II may improve clinical outcomes among Category I treatment failures and defaults who found to have active, infectious MDR TB. This strategy significantly reduces delays to MDR TB diagnosis and to the initiation of MDR TB therapy. Success rate of this strategy is 62.2% and 72% in MDR TB and overall CAT I failure cases and defaulters, respectively.	revised CAT II; retreatment; CAT I failure; MDR	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; STANDARDIZED REGIMENS; MDR-TB; IRAN; EPIDEMIOLOGY
10.5588_ijtld.11.0030	Tuberculosis in household contacts of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients	SETTING: The burden of tuberculosis (TB) disease among household contacts of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients is poorly understood and might represent a target for transmission-interrupting interventions. DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study, conducted in Lima, Peru, from June to September 2008, estimated the incidence of TB disease among household contacts of MDR-TB patients in 358 households. RESULTS: Of 2112 household contacts in 80 households (22% of households), 108 (5%) developed TB disease during the study, giving an incidence rate of 2360 per 100000 contact follow-up years for each of the first 3 years after exposure. Drug susceptibility tests (DST) were available for 50 diseased contacts, of whom 36 (80%) had MDR-TB. Forty-two pairs of index-contact DSTs were available, among which the contact had an identical or less resistant phenotype than the index case in 27 pairs. Multivariate Cox regression demonstrated that male contacts (hazard ratio [HR] 2.8, P < 0.05), with previous TB disease (HR 20.7, P < 0.001) and with associated (non-human immunodeficiency virus) comorbidities (HR 11.2, P < 0.001) were more likely to develop TB. CONCLUSION: The high percentage of diseased household contacts highlights an opportunity for household-level interventions to prevent transmission, whether or not these cases were all attributable to the index case.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; incidence; household contacts	DRUG-RESISTANT; TRANSMISSION; INFECTION; PERU
10.5588_ijtld.10.0781	Household contact investigation of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in a high HIV prevalence setting	SETTING: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) are now a nationwide epidemic in South Africa. Epidemiological data suggest nosocomial transmission as the primary route of spread; however, transmission among household contacts has not yet been investigated. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence rates of MDR- and XDR-TB among household contacts of MDR- and XDR-TB index cases diagnosed between January 2005 and September 2008 in a high human immunodeficiency virus prevalence setting. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study evaluating adult household contacts for active TB by culture and drug susceptibility testing at index case diagnosis and again 1 year later. Outcomes were incidence and time to diagnosis of MDR- and XDR-TB. RESULTS: A total of 1766 contacts of 221 MDR-TB and 287 XDR-TB index cases were screened. Of 793 contacts of MDR-TB index cases, 14 (1.8%) were diagnosed with MDR-TB (incidence 1765/100000); 19 (2.0%) of 973 XDR-TB contacts had XDR-TB (incidence 1952/100000). Median time to diagnosis of household cases was 70 days (interquartile range 57-89). CONCLUSION: Incidence rates of MDR- and XDR-TB among household contacts were extremely high, with most secondary cases occurring shortly after the diagnosis of the index case. Active case finding of drug-resistant TB is a high-yield public health activity and must be a priority, as early diagnosis may stem further disease spread and improve survival.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; household contacts; transmission; South Africa	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; CLOSE CONTACTS; SOUTH-AFRICA; TRANSMISSION; INFECTION; FITNESS; STRAIN
10.5588_ijld.10.0594	Nationwide survey of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in Mongolia	BACKGROUND: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) has emerged as an obstacle to effective TB control. SETTING: The eight district and 21 province TB dispensaries and the two TB hospitals comprising the diagnostic centers for TB in Mongolia. METHODS: To investigate drug resistance levels among new and retreated TB cases. Specifically, we determined the prevalence of resistance to rifampin, streptomycin, isoniazid and ethambutol among TB patients with and without prior anti-tuberculosis treatment. RESULTS: A total of 850 patients (74.1% of eligible and 78.0% of patients with a specimen) had Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated and are the subject of this analysis. Of these, 200 had a history of prior treatment and 650 did not. Any multidrug resistance was found in 7.5% (95% CI 5.9-9.5), with respectively 27.5% (95% CI 21.8-34.1) and 1.4% (95% CI 0.7-1.6) of patients with and without prior history of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The most conspicuous finding in our survey was the relatively low prevalence of multidrug resistance among patients without a history of prior treatment, as compared to very high prevalence among previously treated patients. This suggests that retreatment is deficient and poses a threat to continued transmission, which has not yet manifested itself among new patients.	TB; MDR-TB; DST	TUBERCULOSIS
10.5588_ijtld.10.0697	Field assessment of the direct nitrate reductase assay for rapid detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Honduras	SETTING: The national TB reference laboratory and four health care units connected to the national laboratory network in Honduras, Central America. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of the direct nitrate reductase assay (NRA) for rapid, low-cost detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in a resource-limited setting. DESIGN: Consecutive smear-positive samples (n = 185) were prospectively analysed with NRA and compared to the proportion method on Lowenstein Jensen medium (PM-U) to detect resistance to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP). RESULTS: The NRA sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for INH and RMP were respectively 100%, 99%, 91%, 100% and 80%, 100%, 100%, 99%. Good agreement was observed between NRA and PM-L (kappa > 0.8). CONCLUSION: The direct NRA is a reliable alternative for rapid and low-cost identification of MDR-TB cases in resource-limited settings.

10.1111_j.1469_0691.2010.03351.x	Tuberculosis drug-resistance in Lisbon, Portugal: a 6-year overview	Multidrug-resistance and extensive drug-resistance pose a serious threat to tuberculosis management in Portugal. The country has high TB incidence rates in comparison with other European Union countries, with the Lisbon Health Region being one of the most affected. In the present study we have analysed a convenience sample of 3025 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates, recovered over a 6-year period (2001-2006) in the Lisbon Health Region, regarding drug-resistance both to first-line and second-line drugs. Moreover, 100 of these isolates were also genotyped by 12-loci Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Unit - Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (MIRU-VNTR) analysis. We have compared each year and observed the existence of 22 different resistance profiles, with MDR-TB rates ranging between 9.9% and 15.2% and XDR-TB rates, relative to the number of MDR-TB isolates, between 44.3% and 66.1% (excluding 1 year here considered as an outlier). A steady increase in the fraction of MDR-TB isolates resistant to all first-line drugs was also noticed. The genotyping analysis of MDR-TB isolates revealed six clusters, of which three (Lisboa3, Lisboa4 and Q1) were related to XDR-TB. Our results show that active transmission of MDR- and XDR-TB is taking place and that the high prevalence of observed XDR-TB is due to the continued transmission of particular genetic clusters. Enforcement of the implementation of genotyping in diagnostic routines would lead to early detection of resistant cases.

10.1183_09031936.00073611	WHO guidelines for the programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis: 2011 update	The production of guidelines for the management of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) fits the mandate of the World Health Organization (WHO) to support countries in the reinforcement of patient care. WHO commissioned external reviews to summarise evidence on priority questions regarding case-finding, treatment regimens for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), monitoring the response to MDR-TB treatment, and models of care. A multidisciplinary expert panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to develop recommendations. The recommendations support the wider use of rapid drug susceptibility testing for isoniazid and rifampicin or rifampicin alone using molecular techniques. Monitoring by sputum culture is important for early detection of failure during treatment. Regimens lasting >= 20 months and containing pyrazinamide, a fluoroquinolone, a second-line injectable drug, ethionamide (or prothionamide), and either cycloserine or p-aminosalicylic acid are recommended. The guidelines promote the early use of antiretroviral agents for TB patients with HIV on second-line drug regimens. Systems that primarily employ ambulatory models of care are recommended over others based mainly on hospitalisation. Scientific and medical associations should promote the recommendations among practitioners and public health decision makers involved in MDR-TB care. Controlled trials are needed to improve the quality of existing evidence, particularly on the optimal composition and duration of MDR-TB treatment regimens.

pub-1328	Study of KIR Expression and HLA Ligands in CD56(+) Lymphocytes of Drug Resistant Tuberculosis Patients	Analysis of receptor ligand interactions in the context of diseases necessitates to understand how HLA-KIR genotypes function in diseases. Although CD56(+) lymphocytes are derived from multiple lineages, they share a functional association with immunosurviellance and antimicrobial responses. The present study aimed to determine whether KIR phenotype in CD56 lymphocytes and corresponding HLA-class 1 ligands are associated with multidrug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB). We compared the frequencies of HLA-C and HLA-BW4 genes, the expression of KIRs 2DL1/2DS1, 2DL2/2DL3, 3DL1, and 2DS4 and the combinations of HLA/KIR in 32 Nifamycin and Isoniazid-resistant TB with those in 68 drug non resistant (NR) sputum smear positive pulmonary TB patients. PCR-SSP and flow cytometry were performed for HLA and KIRs typing, respectively. We showed no significant differences between inhibitory or activating KIRs as well as HLA ligands in MDR TB patients compared with NR-TB. The combinations of inhibitory KIR-HLA ligands in MDR-TB were much more prevalent, but not statistically significant than in NR patients (p=0.07). The frequency of MDR patients with all HLA-C and HLA-BW4 ligands was higher than NR-TB (p<0.009). Conversely, the percentage of MDR patients having only one kind of HLA gene was significantly lower than NR-TB (p<0.01). We conclude that the expression of inhibitory KIRs with corresponding HLA ligands genes, and/or co-existence of three HLA class 1 ligands for inhibitory KIRs may be associated with drug resistance in pulmonary tuberculosis.

10.1007_s10096_011_1200_7	Extremely high prevalence of multidrug resistant tuberculosis in Murmansk, Russia: a population-based study	Drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) in the Murmansk region was investigated in a 2-year, population-based surveillance of the civilian population. During 2003 and 2004, isolates from all culture-positive cases were collected (n = 1,226). Prevalence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) was extremely high, as 114 out of 439 new cases (26.0%), and 574 out of 787 previously treated cases (72.9%) were resistant to at least isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF). Spoligotyping of the primary MDR-TB isolates revealed that most isolates grouped to the Beijing SIT1 genotype (n = 91, 79.8%). Isolates of this genotype were further analyzed by IS6110 RFLP. Sequencing of gene targets associated with INH and RIF resistance further showed that the MDR-TB strains are highly homogeneous as 78% of the MDR, SIT1 strains had the same resistance-conferring mutations. The genetic homogeneity of the MDR-TB strains indicates that they are actively transmitted in Murmansk.

10.1371_journal.pone.0023081	Treatment of Tuberculosis in a Region with High Drug Resistance: Outcomes, Drug Resistance Amplification and Re-Infection	Introduction: Emerging antituberculosis drug resistance is a serious threat for tuberculosis (TB) control, especially in Eastern European countries. Methods: We combined drug susceptibility results and molecular strain typing data with treatment outcome reports to assess the influence of drug resistance on TB treatment outcomes in a prospective cohort of patients from Abkhazia (Georgia). Patients received individualized treatment regimens based on drug susceptibility testing (DST) results. Definitions for antituberculosis drug resistance and treatment outcomes were in line with current WHO recommendations. First and second line DST, and molecular typing were performed in a supranational laboratory for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains from consecutive sputum smear-positive TB patients at baseline and during treatment. Results: At baseline, MTB strains were fully drug-susceptible in 189/326 (58.0%) of patients. Resistance to at least H or R (PDR-TB) and multidrug-resistance (MDR-TB) were found in 69/326 (21.2%) and 68/326 (20.9%) of strains, respectively. Three MDR-TB strains were also extensively resistant (XDR-TB). During treatment, 3/189 (1.6%) fully susceptible patients at baseline were re-infected with a MDR-TB strain and 2/58 (3.4%) PDR-TB patients became MDR-TB due to resistance amplification. 5/47 (10.6%) MDR-patients became XDR-TB during treatment. Treatment success was observed in 161/189 (85.2%), 54/69 (78.3%) and 22/68 (32.3%) of patients with fully drug susceptible, PDR- and MDR-TB, respectively. Development of ofloxacin resistance was significantly associated with a negative treatment outcome. Conclusion: In Abkhazia, a region with high prevalence of drug resistant TB, the use of individualized MDR-TB treatment regimens resulted in poor treatment outcomes and XDR-TB amplification. Nosocomial transmission of MDR-TB emphasizes the importance of infection control in hospitals.		MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; EMERGENCE; COUNTRIES

Poverty levels are high with a gross national income per capita of less than two thousand dollars. The country has a high burden of tuberculosis (TB) with an estimated 50,000 incident cases during 2009, when the estimated prevalence was 209 cases per 100,000 of the population. Few studies have been undertaken on TB in Sudan and the prevalence of drug resistant disease is not known. Methods: In this study Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from 235 patients attending three treatment centers in Sudan were screened for susceptibility to isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin by the proportion method on Lowenstein Jensen media. 232 isolates were also genotyped by spoligotyping. Demographic details of patients were recorded using a structured questionnaire. Statistical analyses were conducted to examine the associations between drug resistance with risk ratios computed for a set of risk factors (gender, age, case status - new or relapse, geographic origin of the patient, spoligotype, number of people per room, marital status and type of housing). Results: Multi drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), being resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, was found in 5% (95% CI: 2,8) of new cases and 24% (95% CI: 14,34) of previously treated patients. Drug resistance was associated with previous treatment with risk ratios of 3.51 (95% CI: 2.69-4.60; p < 0.001) for resistance to any drug and 5.23 (95% CI: 2.30-11.90; p < 0.001) for MDR-TB. Resistance was also associated with the geographic region of origin of the patient, being most frequently observed in patients from the Northern region and least in the Eastern region with risk ratios of 7.43 (95%CI:3.42,16.18; p: < 0.001) and 14.09 (95%CI:1.80,110.53; p:0.026) for resistance to any drug and MDR-TB. The major genotype observed was of the Central Asia spoligotype family (CAS1_Delhi), representing 49% of the 232 isolates examined. Conclusions: We conclude that emergence of drug resistant tuberculosis has the potential to be a serious public health problem in Sudan and that strengthened tuberculosis control and improved monitoring of therapy is needed. Further surveillance is required to fully ascertain the extent of the problem.		RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; HIV COINFECTION; DIFFERENTIATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; SERVICES; COST
10.1111_j.1440_1843.2011.01990.x	Risk factors associated with fluoroquinolone-resistant tuberculosis in a Beijing tuberculosis referral hospital	Background and objective: The rapid increase in the number of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases worldwide emphasizes the importance of rational use of key important life-saving second-line anti-TB drugs such as fluoroquinolones. In order to provide information for better case management, so as to minimize the further spread of extensively drug-resistant TB, a retrospective study was performed to assess the risk factors associated with fluoroquinolone resistance among TB patients attending the 309 Hospital in Beijing, China. Methods: Drug susceptibility testing results and clinical data for hospitalized TB patients for the period 2000-2010 were analysed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the risk factors associated with fluoroquinolone-resistant TB. Results: From July 2000 to July 2010, ofloxacin resistance was observed in 306 of 3546 (8.6%) hospitalized TB patients who were tested. The independent risk factors associated with fluoroquinolone-resistant TB were being single (adjusted OR 1.65), being a migrant living in Beijing (adjusted OR 2.15), being a migrant from another area (adjusted OR 5.07), being a patient who was retreated (adjusted OR 2.84), exposure to fluoroquinolones (adjusted OR 2.73), having COPD (adjusted OR 3.53), having COPD with known exposure to fluoroquinolones (adjusted OR 2.47), having MDR-TB (adjusted OR 1.67), and having poly-resistant TB (adjusted OR 2.34). Conclusions: These findings suggest that in high-risk populations continuous surveillance of fluoroquinolone resistance should be maintained. In addition, programs should be implemented for the management of patients with MDR-TB and more complicated TB, so as to minimize the further spread of fluoroquinolone resistance and extensively drug-resistant TB.	drug resistance; drug susceptibility testing; fluoroquinolone; risk factor; tuberculosis	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; PREVALENCE; EXPOSURE
10.1128_JCM.00231_11	Incidence of Moxifloxacin Resistance in Clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates in Houston, Texas	Comprehensive data on the prevalence of quinolone resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates in the United States are scarce. By use of a systematic population-based approach, M. tuberculosis strains from tuberculosis (TB) cases were collected in Harris County, TX, in 2007 to 2008. The susceptibilities of M. tuberculosis isolates to moxifloxacin and ofloxacin were determined by the agar proportion indirect susceptibility method. Spoligotyping and 12-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit (MIRU12)-based genotyping of M. tuberculosis isolates were performed, and the gyrA, gyrB, Rv2686c, Rv2687c, and Rv2688c genes in quinolone-resistant and year-of-diagnosis-matched M. tuberculosis isolates were sequenced. Susceptibility testing was performed on 557 M. tuberculosis isolates, of which 10 (1.8%) were resistant to moxifloxacin. There was 100% concordance between ofloxacin and moxifloxacin susceptibilities. A quinolone was prescribed to at least 5 (50%) patients in the period preceding TB diagnosis. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was significantly associated with quinolone resistance (P = 0.01). Mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region of gyrA were found for 50% of the resistant isolates. No other presumptive quinolone resistance-associated mutations were identified. We conclude that the incidence of moxifloxacin-resistant TB is low in Harris County and is associated with MDR-TB. Previous exposure to quinolones is common among patients with moxifloxacin resistance and warrants more careful evaluation.

10.1016_j.meegid.2011.05.019	Coding and non-coding polymorphisms in VDR gene and susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis in tribes, castes and Muslims of Central India	Vitamin D receptor (VDR) plays an important role in activating immune response against various infectious agents. This study was aimed to investigate the association between VDR gene polymorphisms and different clinical forms of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in different population groups. Four common polymorphisms (TaqI, ApaI, BsmI and FokI) of VDR gene were studied in clinically diagnosed TB patients and healthy controls from Sahariya tribe (n = 377), Bhil tribe (n = 95), Chhattisgarh tribe (n = 33), general population from North-Central (NC) (n = 1021) and South-Eastern (SE) region (n = 646) and Muslims (n = 217). Genotyping was carried out using PCR-RFLP method and re-confirmed by direct sequencing. The haplotype analysis was performed on Haploview 4.1 and statistical analysis was done using SPSS 13.0 software. We found that bb genotype of BsmI polymorphism conferred significant risk to smear positive and multiple drug resistant (MDR) TB in tribes [OR (CI) = 3.7(1.5-9.2), p = 0.002], SE population [OR (CI) = 2.1 (1.4-3.3), p = 0.0004] and Muslims [OR (CI) = 6.7 (1.1-39), p = 0.01]. The subjects with FF genotype of Fold polymorphism appeared less likely (p = 0.004) to develop MDR TB in NC population, whereas, those with Ff [OR (CI) = 2.5 (1.3-5.0), p = 0.004] and ff [OR (CI) = 3.4 (1.2-9.3), p = 0.01] genotypes were at high risk of MDR and smear positive disease, respectively. Similarly, tt genotype of TaqI polymorphism was found associated with high risk of smear positive TB in NC [OR (Cl) = 3.6 (0.9-14.2), p = 0.05] as well as in SE [OR (CI) = 4.7 (1.8-12.3), p = 0.00003] population. Interestingly, tt genotype appeared strongly associated [OR (CI) = 8.9 (2.7-29), p = 0.00001] with high bacillary load outcome. In conclusion, genetic polymorphisms in VDR gene, alone or in combination (haplotypes) are associated with different clinical outcomes in pulmonary TB. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

10.1111_j.1574_695X.2011.00814.x	Detection of mutations associated with multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates	Antimicrobial resistance was studied in 100 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains selected randomly from sputum cultures of newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients. Resistance of the isolates to rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol was tested by both drug susceptibility testing (DST) and allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR). A total of 19 (19%) isolates were found resistant to at least one of the antituberculosis drugs investigated by PCR compared with 14 (14%) resistant isolates detected by DST. Eleven mutations were detected by AS-PCR in the rpoB gene (codons 516, 526, and 531), associated with rifampicin resistance, a marker of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), 14 mutations in the katG gene codon 315 that confers resistance to isoniazid, and nine mutations in the embB gene codon 306 that confers resistance to ethambutol. Mutations in the six multidrug-resistant isolates were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Results were compared with phenotypic DST data. Nineteen different mutation types to at least one of the drugs were found; six isolates (6%) were classified as MDR-TB, defined as resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid. The rates of concordance of the PCR with the phenotypic susceptibility test were 71.4, 54.5, and 44.4 for isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol, respectively. These results highlight the importance of molecular epidemiology studies of tuberculosis in understudied regions with a tuberculosis burden to uncover the true prevalence of the MDR-TB.

10.1093_jac_dkr221	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment in the UK: a study of injectable use and toxicity in practice	Background: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is an increasing challenge to health services globally. Although new drugs are in development, current guidelines still recommend prolonged use of injectable antimicrobials (usually amikacin, kanamycin or capreomycin). The evidence base to inform treatment and monitoring strategies is very limited. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of patients initiating injectable antimicrobials for MDR-TB treatment in five UK centres between January 2004 and December 2009. (i) Current treatment and monitoring strategies were reviewed. (ii) The incidence of ototoxicity (defined both clinically and on audiological testing) and factors associated with ototoxicity were investigated using logistic regression. Results: (i) The choice of injectable antimicrobial varied. Of 50 MDR-TB patients, 29/50 (58%) received amikacin, 11/50 (22%) received capreomycin and 10/50 (20%) received streptomycin or a combination; reflecting a difference in policy between centres. Only 21/50 (42%) patients received baseline screening by audiogram within 2 weeks of starting treatment and 16/50 (32%) then had monthly audiograms, with the majority screened more infrequently and 12/50 (24%) receiving no screening. (ii) Of the 50 patients, 14 (28%) experienced ototoxicity, with 9/50 (18%) left with long-term hearing loss. Increased age (P = 0.02), use of amikacin (P 0.02) and decreased renal function (P = 0.01) were significantly associated with ototoxicity. Conclusions: There is local variation in both the choice of injectable agent and in ototoxicity screening practices. Long-term morbidity from injectable treatment is significant even in this well-resourced setting, and the data suggest capreomycin might be associated with less ototoxicity when compared with amikacin. There is a need for more high-quality clinical data to inform future guidelines for treatment and monitoring.	aminoglycosides; capreomycin; drug toxicity	IN-VITRO ACTIVITIES; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; HEARING-LOSS; AMINOGLYCOSIDE; STREPTOMYCIN; OTOTOXICITY; DEAFNESS
10.1111_j.1365_3156.2011.02792.x	Resistance to first-line tuberculosis drugs in three cities of Nigeria	OBJECTIVES To determine the levels of resistance to first-line tuberculosis drugs in three cities in three geopolitical zones in Nigeria. METHODS A total of 527 smear-positive sputum samples from Abuja, Ibadan and Nnewi were cultured on BACTEC-MGIT 960. Drug susceptibility tests (DST) for streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol were performed on 428 culture-positive samples on BACTEC-MGIT960. RESULTS Eight per cent of the specimens cultured were multi-drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) with varying levels of resistance to individual and multiple first-line drugs. MDR was strongly associated with previous treatment: 5% of new and 19% of previously treated patients had MDR-TB (OR 4.1 (95% CI 1.9-8.8), P = 0.001) and with young adult age: 63% of patients with and 38% without MDR-TB were 25-34 years old (P = 0.01). HIV status was documented in 71%. There was no association between MDR-TB and HIV coinfection (P = 0.9) and gender (P > 0.2 for both). CONCLUSIONS MDR-TB is an emerging problem in Nigeria. Developing good quality drug susceptibility test facilities, routine monitoring of drug susceptibility and improved health systems for the delivery of and adherence to first-and second-line treatment are imperative to solve this problem.	multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis; urban cities; first-line TB drugs; newly diagnosed and previously treated TB; HIV	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS
10.1371_journal.pone.0020436	Outcomes of Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) among a Cohort of South African Patients with High HIV Prevalence	Background: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major clinical challenge, particularly in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection. MDR-TB treatment is increasingly available, but outcomes have not been well characterized. South Africa has provided MDR-TB treatment for a decade, and we evaluated outcomes by HIV status for patients enrolled between 2000 and 2004 prior to anti-retroviral access. Methods: We assessed treatment outcomes in a prospective cohort of patients with MDR-TB from eight provincial programs providing second line drugs. World Health Organization definitions were used. Results were stratified by HIV status. Results: Seven hundred fifty seven patients with known HIV status were included in the final analysis, and HIV infection was documented in 287 (38%). Overall, 348 patients (46.0%) were successfully treated, 74 (9.8%) failed therapy, 177 (23.4%) died and 158 (20.9%) defaulted. Patients with HIV were slightly younger and less likely to be male compared to HIV negative patients. Patients with HIV were less likely to have a successful treatment outcome (40.0 vs. 49.6; P<0.05) and more likely to die (35.2 vs. 16.2; P<0.0001). In a competing risk survival analysis, patients with HIV had a higher hazard of death (HR: 2.33, P<0.0001). Low baseline weight (less than 45 kg and less than 60 kg) was also associated with a higher hazard of death (HR: 2.52, P<0.0001; and HR: 1.50, P<0.0001, respectively, compared to weight greater than 60 kg). Weight less than 45 kg had higher risk of failure (HR: 3.58, P<0.01). Any change in treatment regimen was associated with a higher hazard of default (HR: 2.86; 95% CI 1.55-5.29, P<0.001) and a lower hazard of death (HR: 0.63, P<0.05). Conclusions: In this MDR-TB treatment program patients with HIV infection and low weight had higher hazards of death. Overall treatment outcomes were poor. Efforts to improve treatment for MDR-TB are urgently needed.		SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; THERAPY; METAANALYSIS; FAILURES; DEFAULT; RATES
10.1164_rccm.201011_1924OC	Rifampicin Reduces Susceptibility to Ofloxacin in Rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis through Efflux	Rationale: Central dogma suggests that rifampicin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis develops solely through rpoB gene mutations. Objective: To determine whether rifampicin induces efflux pumps activation in rifampicin resistant M. tuberculosis strains thereby defining rifampicin resistance levels and reducing ofloxacin susceptibility. Methods: Rifampicin and/or ofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined in rifampicin resistant strains by culture in BACTEC 12B medium. Verapamil and reserpine were included to determine their effect on rifampicin and ofloxacin susceptibility. RT-qPCR was applied to assess expression of efflux pump/transporter genes after rifampicin exposure. To determine whether verapamil could restore susceptibility to first-line drugs, BALB/cmice were infected with a MDR-TB strain and treated with first-line drugs with/without verapamil. Measurements and Main Findings: Rifampicin MICs varied independently of rpoB mutation and genetic background. Addition reserpine and verapamil significantly restored rifampicin susceptibility (p = 0.0000). RT-qPCR demonstrated that rifampicin induced differential expression of efflux/transporter genes in MDR-TB isolates. Incubation of rifampicin mono-resistant strains in rifampicin (2 mu g/ml) for 7 days induced ofloxacin resistance (MIC > 2 mu g/ml) in strains with an rpoB531 mutation. Ofloxacin susceptibility was restored by exposure to efflux pump inhibitors. Studies in BALB/c mice showed that verapamil in combination with first-line drugs significantly reduced pulmonary CFUs after 1 and 2 months treatment (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Exposure of rifampicin resistant M. tuberculosis strains to rifampicin can potentially compromise the efficacy of the second-line treatment regimens containing ofloxacin, thereby emphasising the need for rapid diagnostics to guide treatment. Efflux pump inhibitors have the potential to improve the efficacy of anti-tuberculosis drug treatment.

10.3855_jidc.1259	Anti-tuberculosis drug resistance and associated risk factors in a tertiary level TB centre in Iran: a retrospective analysis	Introduction: This study aimed to determine first-line anti-tuberculosis drug resistance rates in new and previously treated cases and to identify risk factors associated with multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) at the National Reference Tuberculosis Laboratory of Iran. Methodology: This was a retrospective analysis of all confirmed TB patients from December 2000 to June 2005. Drug susceptibility testing to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide was performed on Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium according to the proportion method. Results: Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains were isolated from 1,742 patients with TB, of whom 935 (53.7%) were male. The mean age of patients was 44.2 +/- 17.4 years (SD). A total of 1,074 patients were native Iranians while 668 (38.3%) were immigrant patients. Out of 1,139 (65.4%) new cases, 340 (29.9%) had at least one drug resistance. Of 603 (34.6%) previously treated cases, 416 (69.0%) had resistant strains. There were 263 patients (15.1%) with MDR-TB, 72 of whom were new (6.3% of all new cases) and 191 were previously treated (31.7% of all previously treated cases). Factors associated with MDR-TB included age under 45 years, male sex, previous TB treatment, immigration, poor living conditions, and unemployment. Conclusions: The high rate of initial resistance in MDR-TB cases and the high rate of MDR-TB in a young age group were indicators of recent transmission. Therefore, closer monitoring of transmission trends of drug resistant strains should be considered as priority, to ensure a successful TB control programme.

10.4103_0022_3859.85197	Resistance pattern in drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis	Background: Drug-resistant tuberculosis is an important issue for public health. There is a rise in the trend of drug-resistant tuberculosis, especially multi drug resistance (MDR), in different parts of world, India being one of the high burden countries. This study is undertaken to assess the various patterns of resistance among confirmed drug resistant pulmonary tubercular patients and to initiate second line anti tubercular treatment. Aims and Objectives: To assess various resistance patterns among confirmed drug resistant pulmonary tubercular patients and for the initiation of appropriate drug regimens in our setup. Study Design: An observational prospective study. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted at Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases, Bangalore between January 2005 and November 2010. A total of 309 drug resistant tuberculosis cases were studied. Sputum culture and drug sensitivity were carried out at National Tuberculosis Institute. Drug sensitivity testing done for all first line drugs, except pyrazinamide, by using LJ media. Results: In this study, out of 309 patients, MDR pattern was observed in 224 (72%), of which 20 (6.47%) had resistance only to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP), 58 (18.7%) had resistance to INH, RMP, and either of the other first line drugs streptomycinor ethambutol and 146 (47.25%) had resistance to all first line drugs. Poly drug resistance pattern was observed in 72 (23.3%) and Mono drug resistance in 13 (4.2%). Conclusion: In the present study the most common pattern observed is MDR with predominant resistance to INH. There is a rise in the number of drug resistant tuberculosis cases, especially MDR. Hence close monitoring of drug resistant pattern is required to formulate designs of different regimens in the treatment of drug resistant tuberculosis; especially MDR-TB based on accredited laboratory reports, in a specialized center which is very much essential for the betterment of the patients and the community.

10.4103_0255_0857.83913	Assessment of trends of ofloxacin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Purpose: Ofloxacin (OFX) is one of the potent fluoroquinolone (FQ) recommended to treat MDR-TB. Over a decade, the preexposure of this drug for the treatment of other bacterial infections has resulted in acquisition of FQ resistance among Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Considering this possibility, a study was undertaken in a tertiary care center in the capital city (India) to assess the drug resistance trends of OFX among susceptible and multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of M. tuberculosis. Materials and Methods: A total of 102 M. tuberculosis isolates (47 susceptible to first-line drugs and 55 MDR isolates) were screened for susceptibility testing of OFX with a critical concentration of 2 mu g/ml by Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) proportion method. Results: The results showed 40 (85.1%) isolates among 47 susceptible isolates and 34 (61.8%) isolates among 55 MDR isolates, were found to be susceptible to OFX. Fisher's exact test showed significant P-value (0.0136) demonstrating 1.377 fold (95% confidence interval) increased risk to become resistant to OFX than susceptible isolates. These finding shows decreased OFX susceptibility is not only limited to MDR isolates but also increasingly seen in susceptible strains as a result of drug abuse. Conclusions: Our finding were not alarming, but highlights the general risk of acquiring resistance to OFX, jeopardizing the potential for these drugs to be used as second-line anti-TB agents in the management of drug-resistant TB and creating incurable TB strains.

10.1016_j.tube.2011.02.003	Changes in cell-mediated immune response after lung resection surgery for MDR-TB patients	The immune responses of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients undergoing lung resection surgery were investigated in order to understand the mechanism of strong immune suppression in MDR-TB. We examined changes in cell-mediated immune response (CMI) of a total of sixteen MDR-TB patients, three of them extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) patients, after the removal of the heavily diseased lung section. The IFN-gamma response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture filtrate proteins (Mtb-CFP), one of the most important CMI to defend TB, showed a statistically significant elevation in 2-4 months after operation when compared to the preoperative CMI in patients who were converted into AFB negative and cured in two years' follow-up, suggesting that the recovery of CMI may be one of the key factors in the successful treatment of MDR-TB. Interestingly, IL-10 response to Mtb-CFP was also elevated in 2-4 months after surgery in cured patients although both proliferative response and PBMC composition were not significantly changed. Infection with first- or second-line drugs resistant Mtb reduces the efficiency of chemotherapeutic treatment of MDR-TB to about 50%. Thus, this study suggests that chemotherapeutic treatment of MDR-TB may be more effective when combined with accompanying therapy that increases CMI, includes lung resection surgery.

10.5588_ijtld.10.0601	Countrywide management of pulmonary tuberculosis reverses increasing incidence	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of countrywide management of tuberculosis (TB) and the availability of second-line drugs (SLDs) on the notification rates of pulmonary TB (PTB) overall and of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), taking into account human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection and the national economy in Estonia. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of notification rates and treatment outcomes of PTB and MDR-TB during 1998-2006. RESULTS: The annual notification rates of both PTB and MDR-TB decreased significantly, by on average 3.3 (P = 0.007) and 1.7 (P = 0.008) cases per 100000 population, respectively. The accelerating impact of SLD availability on the annual decline was significant for both PTB overall and MDR-TB (P = 0.003 and P = 0.025, respectively). During 1998-2006, an increase in TB-HIV co-infection (P = 0.009) significantly affected the notification rates of both PTB overall and MDR-TB (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). The negative impact of TB-HIV co-infection was counterbalanced by the availability of SLDs, the decrease in the MDR-TB rate and the increase in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, as confirmed by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Countrywide access to SLDs and the coordinated effect of programmatic conditions can, in parallel with increasing GDP, reverse the increasing notification rates of PTB and MDR-TB in the context of an HIV epidemic.

10.5588_ijtld.10.0296	Tuberculosis surveillance in Cape Town, South Africa: an evaluation	SETTING: Cape Town, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the current system of tuberculosis surveillance in the Cape Metro region. DESIGN: This evaluation was based on the 'Updated Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems' of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, modified to render the framework applicable to the context of tuberculosis (TB) surveillance. The evaluation incorporated qualitative exploration of perceptions and experiences of system users. RESULTS: System users were very accepting of the system and were committed to seeing it achieve its purpose within public health. Some individuals expressed concerns about the rigidity of the Electronic TB Register software and its analysis capabilities. Dissemination of TB data and evidence-based action within the Cape Metro region are strong attributes of Cape Town's TB surveillance system. At the time of the evaluation, integration of TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) data was weak, as was multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) surveillance; the South African Tuberculosis Control Programme is developing initiatives to improve these areas. CONCLUSIONS: Cape Metro's TB surveillance is strong, although it would be strengthened by increasing availability of data reflecting TB-I-BY co-infection and MDR-TB. Systems operations could be improved by increasing software flexibility, and increased integration of electronic data across health regions would enhance the capacity and assessment of control efforts.	epidemiology; tuberculosis; evaluation study; surveillance	BURDEN
10.5588_ijtld.10.0515	Evaluation of the Genotype (R) MTBDRplus assay as a tool for drug resistance surveys	SETTING: A national tuberculosis (TB) drug resistance survey in Tanzania. OBJECTIVE : To compare the performance of the Genotype (R) MTBDRplus line-probe assay (LPA) on smear-positive sputum specimens with conventional culture and isoniazid (INH) plus rifampicin (RMP) drug susceptibility testing (DST). DESIGN: Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates tested at the Tanzanian Central TB Reference Laboratory (CTRL) were submitted for quality assurance of phenotypic DST to its supranational reference laboratory (SRL), together with ethanol-preserved sputum specimens for LPA DST. RESULTS: Only 321 samples could be tested using LPA; of these, three were identified as being non-tuberculous mycobacteria using CTRL DST. Both tests had 269 sets with interpretable results. CTRL DST yielded almost the same number of interpretable results as LPA, with 90% concordance (kappa = 0.612, P < 0.001). Five (1.9%) multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, 46 (17.1%) resistant to INH only and 0 RMP only, were found by CTRL DST. For the LPA, these results were respectively 5 (1.9%), 26 (9.7%) and 2 (0.7%). With SRL DST as the gold standard, LPA was more accurate than CTRL DST for RMP, but missed almost half the INH-resistant samples. CONCLUSION: LPA applied directly on ethanol-preserved sputum specimens was similar to phenotypic DST in terms of yield of interpretable results. Although probably more accurate for RMP and MDR-TB, it appears to seriously underestimate INH resistance. Considering speed, easy and safe specimen transportation and low infrastructure requirements, LPA DST from sputum can be recommended for surveys in resource-poor settings.	tuberculosis; drug resistance surveillance; diagnosis; rifampicin; isoniazid	LINE PROBE ASSAY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; RPOB GENE; IMPLEMENTATION; PERFORMANCE; TANZANIA; RIFAMPIN
10.1111_j.1365_3083.2011.02538.x	Treatment of Multi-Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Mice with DNA Vaccines Alone or in Combination with Chemotherapeutic Drugs	The problems of tuberculosis (TB) and its drug resistances are very severe in China. New therapeutic agents or regimens to treat multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are urgently needed. We studied the effects of Ag85A DNA vaccine alone or in combination with rifampin (RFP) or pyrazinamide (PZA) for the treatment of MDR-TB in mice. Ag85A DNA vaccine significantly increased the production of IFN-gamma, but lowered the production of IL-4. Seventy female BALB/c mice infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolate HB361, which was resistant to RFP and isoniazid but sensitive to PZA, were treated with plasmid pVAX1, RFP, PZA, M. vaccae vaccine, Ag85A DNA, Ag85A DNA combined with RFP or PZA, respectively. Ag85A DNA vaccine alone or in combination with RFP or PZA reduced the pulmonary and splenic bacterial loads by 1.03-1.38 logs, respectively. Ag85A DNA combined with conventional chemotherapy for the treatment of MDR-TB might result in cure of MDR-TB in developing countries.

10.1007_s10096_011_1167_4	Comparison of isoniazid monoresistant tuberculosis with drug-susceptible tuberculosis and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Limited data exist about the clinical characteristics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) isolates with resistance to isoniazid (IZN). We describe the demographic and clinical characteristics and risk factor information for persons with IZN monoresistant (resistant to isoniazid) TB compared with drug-susceptible TB and multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. From 2002 to 2009, 590 cases of TB were diagnosed. Of these, 44 (7.5%) developed MDR-TB and 38 (6.4%) had IZN monoresistant TB. Among the IZN monoresistant TB patients, more common demographic characteristics were former resident of the Soviet Union immigrant, smoker, and previous history of TB (p = 0.005, 0.025, and 0.005, respectively), while HIV, weight loss, and hemoptysis were less common (p = 0.005 for all parameters). The mean length of treatment was 24 +/- 4 months for MDR-TB, 10 +/- 3 months for IZN monoresistant TB cases, and 8 +/- 2 months for all other TB cases. The directly observed therapy (DOT) rate was similar in all three groups. However, treatment failure, completion of TB treatment, and mortality were all similar in drug-susceptible TB and higher in MDR-TB. In multivariate analysis, only a history of previous TB (odds ratio [OR] 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-1.6) was significantly associated with IZN monoresistant TB. IZN monoresistant TB has distinct characteristics. However, the length of treatment and outcome are similar to drug-susceptible TB cases.		UNITED-STATES
10.1016_j.ejps.2011.04.012	Transformation of cinnamic acid from trans- to cis-form raises a notable bactericidal and synergistic activity against multiple-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The long course of treatments on TB with a combination of antibiotics leads unfavorable side effects and poor patient compliance which contributes to sustaining multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Therefore, the development of a new effective drug or synergist to reduce the prevalence of MDR-TB is urgent to date. Cinnamic acid (CA) is a natural occurring phenolic compound with anti-microbial activity. Both trans- and cis-isoforms of CA exist in planta, and cis-cinnamic acid (c-CA) can be transformed from trans-cinnamic acid (t-CA) under sunlight. Due to the unavailability of c-CA, the literature regarding the biological functions of c-CA is still limited. We had previously developed a practicable method for the transformation of c-CA from t-CA and the isolation of c-CA. Using the techniques, sufficient c-CA was obtained to evaluate its antituberculosis activity against a MDR M. tuberculosis strain. Moreover, the synergistic effects of c-CA and t-CA with two first-line anti-TB antibiotics, isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF), were also determined. Although both of c-CA and t-CA decreased the viability of MDR-TB bacilli in a dose-dependent manner, the antituberculosis activity of c-CA was approximately 120-fold of t-CA. Furthermore, the c-CA exhibited higher synergistic effect with INH or RIF against tuberculosis than t-CA. The micrographs of scanning electron microscope (SEM) display that c-CA caused an injury on the out-layer of MDR-TB bacilli. The c-CA might be a potential anti-mycobacterial or synergistic agent that can be developed to against tuberculosis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

pub-1350	Rapid Detection of Isoniazid Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis by a Single Multiplex Allele-specific Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay	Objective: Global surveillance has shown that drug resistant (DR) tuberculosis (TB) is widespread. Prompt detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance is essential for effective control of TB. The most frequent mutations associated with Isoniazid (INH) resistance in Mycobacterium are substitutions at codons 315 in the katG gene and the mabA-inhA promoter region (-15). This survey evaluated INH resistant-associated mutations in order to determine rapid detection of TB resistance. Materials and Methods: Through a descriptive cross- sectional study total of 96 sputum specimens were digested, examined microscopically for acid-fast bacilli and inoculated into Lowenstein-Jensen slants. Thereafter, the susceptibility and identification tests were performed on culture positive specimens. Subsequently, the strains were subjected to multiplex allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (MAS-PCR) targeting in the codons 315 in the katG gene and the mabA-inhA promoter region. Distinct PCR banding patterns were observed for different mutation profiles. Results: Drug susceptibility testing revealed that out of 96 available isolates, 30 (31.3%) were susceptible, 36 (37.5%) had multi-drug resistance (MDR-TB) and 30 (31.3%) showed mono- drug resistance. In comparison with the culture-based phenotypic drug susceptibility test, the sensitivity and specificity of MAS-PCR assay for drug resistance-related genetic mutations were 76.7% and 71.4%, respectively. The correlation between MAS-PCR and culture-based phenotypic drug susceptibility testing findings was 99.4%. Conclusion: The profile of the isolates suggests a significant number of different DR strains with a high frequency of mutations at codon 315 of the katG gene. MAS-PCR provides a rapid, simple and cost-effective method for detecting MDR-TB.	Multidrug Resistant; Tuberculosis; PCR	DRUG-RESISTANCE; STRAINS; IRAN
10.1021_ml200036r	Advent of Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxamides with Potent Multi- and Extended Drug Resistant Antituberculosis Activity	A set of nine 2,7-dimethylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxamides and one 2,6-dimethylimidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidine-3-carboxamide were synthesized. The compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antituberculosis activity versus replicating, nonreplicating, multi- and extensive drug resistant Mtb strains. The MIC(90) values of seven of these agents were <= mu M against the various tuberculosis strains tested. A representative compound of this class (1) was screened against seven nontubercular strains as well as other nonmycobacteria organisms and demonstrated remarkable microbe selectivity. A transcriptional profiling experiment of Mtb treated with compound 1 was performed to give a preliminary indication of the mode of action. Lastly, the in vivo ADME properties of compounds 1, 3, 4, and 6 were assessed. The 2,7-dimethylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxamides are a druglike and synthetically accessible class of anti-TB agents that have excellent selective potency against multi- and extensive drug resistant TB and encouraging pharmacokinetics.

10.3201_eid1706.101471	Multiple Introductions of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis into Households, Lima, Peru	Two cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) in a household are assumed to reflect within-household transmission. However, in high-incidence areas of MDR TB, secondary cases may arise through exposure to MDR TB in the community. To estimate the frequency of multiple introductions of MDR TB into households, we used spoligotyping and 24-loci mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit variable number tandem repeats to classify isolates from 101 households in Lima, Peru, in which >1 MDR TB patient received treatment during 1996-2004. We found different MDR TB strains in >= 10% of households. Alternate approaches for classifying matching strains produced estimates of multiple introductions in <= 38% of households. At least 4% of MDR TB patients were reinfected by a second strain of MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These findings suggest that community exposure to MDR TB in Lima occurs frequently. Rapid drug sensitivity testing of strains from household contacts of known MDR TB patients is needed to identify optimal treatment regimens.

10.1016_S0929_6646_11_60055_7	Effect of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus on the Clinical Severity and Treatment Outcome in Patients With Pulmonary Tuberculosis: A Potential Role in the Emergence of Multidrug-resistance	Background/Purpose: A globally increasing trend of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), the rising prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) in many countries, and the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in recent years pose a serious challenge for TB control. Methods: We investigated pulmonary tuberculosis patients with and without type 2 DM (DMTB and TB, respectively) treated at the Chest Hospital, Taiwan, between November 2004 and October 2005. Results: One hundred and ninety-two new patients (60 DMTB, 132 TB) were regularly treated for a full course 6 months) and prospectively followed for more than 1 year. The DMTB patients had more severe infections (far-advanced: 45.0% vs. 22.7%, p < 0.01), higher mycobacterial loads (sputum smear: 2.9 +/- 1.3(+) vs. 1.9 +/- 1.7(+), p < 0.01), higher treatment failure rates (17% vs. 2%, p < 0.01), and longer delayed clearance of mycobacteria than did the TB patients (2.5 +/- 3.0 months vs. 1.6 +/- 1.4 months, p < 0.01). After one year, three DMTB patients and one TB patient had MDR-TB (5.0% vs. 0.8%, p = 0.056). Bacterial genotyping revealed that the proportion of mycobacterial strains was not significantly different in DMTB and TB patients (Beijing strain: 46.7% vs. 40.6%, Non-Beijing strain: 53.3% vs. 59.4%, p = 0.632). Conclusion: DMTB patients have more severe TB infections, which require longer treatment and are more likely to develop MDR-TB than are patients with TB alone.

10.1371_journal.pone.0017513	Spread of Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa	Background: In 2005 a cluster of 53 HIV-infected patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was detected in the Msinga sub-district, the catchment area for the Church of Scotland Hospital (CoSH) in Tugela Ferry, in KwaZulu-Natal province (KZN), South Africa. KZN is divided into 11 healthcare districts. We sought to determine the distribution of XDR TB cases in the province in relation to population density. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the KZN tuberculosis laboratory database was analysed. Results of all patients with a sputum culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis from January 2006 to June 2007 were included. Drug-susceptibility test results for isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, streptomycin, kanamycin and ofloxacin were available for all patients as well as the location of the hospital where their clinical diagnosis was made. Findings: In total, 20858 patients attending one of 73 hospitals or their adjacent clinics had cultures positive for M. tuberculosis. Of these, 4170 (20%) were MDR-TB cases. Four hundred and forty three (11%) of the MDR tuberculosis cases displayed the XDR tuberculosis susceptibility profile. Only 1429 (34%) of the MDR-TB patients were seen at the provincial referral hospital for treatment. The proportion of XDR-TB amongst culture-confirmed cases was highest in the Msinga subdistrict (19.6%), followed by the remaining part of the Umzinyati district (5.9%) and the other 10 districts (1.1%). The number of hospitals with at least one XDR-TB case increased from 18 (25%) to 58 (80%) during the study period. Interpretation: XDR-TB is present throughout KZN. More than 65% of all diagnosed MDR-TB cases, including XDR-TB patients, were left untreated and likely remained in the community as a source of infection.		
10.1164_rccm.201009_1449OC	Rapid Diagnosis of Tuberculosis and Multidrug Resistance by the Microscopic-Observation Drug-Susceptibility Assay	Rationale: Mortality is exceedingly high and rapid among patients infected with HIV and tuberculosis (TB), in part because of limited access to appropriate TB diagnostics. The microscopic observation drug-susceptibility (MODS) assay is a simple, rapid, low-cost test for TB and multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB, but data in individuals infected with HIV and in Africa are limited. Objectives: To evaluate the MODS assay in a high-HIV-prevalence setting. Methods: We performed a prospective diagnostic accuracy study of consecutive adults suspected to have TB from outpatient and inpatient settings at a district hospital in rural South Africa. Sputum was tested by concentrated smear microscopy; agar (Middlebrook 7H11) and liquid (mycobacterial growth indicator tube) culture; and the MODS assay. Drug-susceptibility testing (DST) was by indirect 1% proportion method and MODS. Reference standard for Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection was growth on Middlebrook or mycobacterial growth indicator tube culture; 1% proportion was the reference standard for isoniazid and rifampin DST. Measurements and Main Results: Among 534 adults enrolled, 388 (73%) were HIV-positive, with a median CD4 count of 161 cells/mm(3) (interquartile range [IQR]: 72-307). TB was diagnosed by the reference standard culture in 113 (21%). MODS sensitivity was 85% (95% confidence interval [Cl], 78-92%), and specificity was 97% (Cl, 95-99%). MODS test performance did not differ by patients' HIV status (sensitivity 88% vs. 90%, specificity 97% vs. 100% for HIV-positive versus HIV-negative, respectively). For MDR-TB diagnosis (n = 11), sensitivity was 100% (one-sided Cl, 68-100%) and specificity was 94% (Cl, 82-98%). Median turnaround time for MDR-TB diagnosis was 7 days (IQR: 6-9) with MODS versus 70 days (IQR: 49-96) with indirect proportion method (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Among adult TB suspects predominantly infected with HIV, MODS provided high sensitivity and specificity for rapid diagnosis of TB and MDR-TB. Given the high mortality from TB and MDR-TB and prolonged opportunity for TB transmission before diagnosis, the MODS assay warrants serious consideration for use in similar high-HIV-prevalence, resource-limited settings.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; HIV; diagnosis; South Africa	NEGATIVE PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; ISONIAZID PREVENTIVE THERAPY; RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS; HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; FUTURE-PROSPECTS; SOUTH-AFRICA; SMEAR; TB; POPULATIONS
10.1371_journal.pone.0019565	Direct Nitrate Reductase Assay versus Microscopic Observation Drug Susceptibility Test for Rapid Detection of MDR-TB in Uganda	The most common method for detection of drug resistant (DR) TB in resource-limited settings (RLSs) is indirect susceptibility testing on Lowenstein-Jensen medium (LJ) which is very time consuming with results available only after 23 months. Effective therapy of DR TB is therefore markedly delayed and patients can transmit resistant strains. Rapid and accurate tests suitable for RLSs in the diagnosis of DR TB are thus highly needed. In this study we compared two direct techniques - Nitrate Reductase Assay (NRA) and Microscopic Observation Drug Susceptibility (MODS) for rapid detection of MDR-TB in a high burden RLS. The sensitivity, specificity, and proportion of interpretable results were studied. Smear positive sputum was collected from 245 consecutive re-treatment TB patients attending a TB clinic in Kampala, Uganda. Samples were processed at the national reference laboratory and tested for susceptibility to rifampicin and isoniazid with direct NRA, direct MODS and the indirect LJ proportion method as reference. A total of 229 specimens were confirmed as M. tuberculosis, of these interpretable results were obtained in 217 (95%) with either the NRA or MODS. Sensitivity, specificity and kappa agreement for MDR-TB diagnosis was 97%, 98% and 0.93 with the NRA; and 87%, 95% and 0.78 with the MODS, respectively. The median time to results was 10, 7 and 64 days with NRA, MODS and the reference technique, respectively. The cost of laboratory supplies per sample was low, around 5 USD, for the rapid tests. The direct NRA and MODS offered rapid detection of resistance almost eight weeks earlier than with the reference method. In the study settings, the direct NRA was highly sensitive and specific. We consider it to have a strong potential for timely detection of MDR-TB in RLS.		MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS RESISTANCE; SPUTUM SAMPLES; RIFAMPIN; CULTURE
10.1371_journal.pone.0018964	Size and Usage Patterns of Private TB Drug Markets in the High Burden Countries	Background: Tuberculosis (TB) control is considered primarily a public health concern, and private sector TB treatment has attracted less attention. Thus, the size and characteristics of private sector TB drug sales remain largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used IMS Health data to analyze private TB drug consumption in 10 high burden countries (HBCs), after first mapping how well IMS data coverage overlapped with private markets. We defined private markets as any channels not used or influenced by national TB programs. Private markets in four countries - Pakistan, the Philippines, Indonesia and India - had the largest relative sales volumes; annually, they sold enough first line TB drugs to provide 65-117% of the respective countries' estimated annual incident cases with a standard 6-8 month regimen. First line drug volumes in five countries were predominantly fixed dose combinations (FDCs), but predominantly loose drugs in the other five. Across 10 countries, these drugs were available in 37 (loose drug) plus 74 (FDCs) distinct strengths. There were 54 distinct, significant first line manufacturers (range 2-11 per country), and most companies sold TB drugs in only a single study country. FDC markets were, however, more concentrated, with 4 companies capturing 69% of FDC volume across the ten countries. Among second line drugs, fluoroquinolones were widely available, with significant volumes used for TB in India, Pakistan and Indonesia. However, certain WHO-recommended drugs were not available and in general there were insufficient drug volumes to cover the majority of the expected burden of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Conclusions/Significance: Private TB drug markets in several HBCs are substantial, stable, and complicated. This calls for appropriate policy and market responses, including expansion of Public-Private Mix (PPM) programs, greater reach, flexibility and appeal of public programs, regulatory and quality enforcement, and expansion of public MDR-TB treatment programs.

pub-1358	DRUG SUSCEPTIBILITY OF MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS IN PATIENTS WITH AIDS AT A TERTIARY CARE HOSPITAL IN NORTHERN INDIA	The study was done to determine the anti-tuberculosis drug resistance patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in AIDS patients. Fifty antiretroviral drug nave new AIDS patients with clinical evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis and no previous history of tuberculosis were recruited. Baseline CD4 counts and plasma viral loads (PVL) were measured by flow cytometry and RT-PCR, respectively. Sputum samples were obtained from each patient and subjected to Ziehl-Neelsen staining and cultured on Lowenstein-Jensen medium and using the BACTEC 460 system (B460). Antimicrobial susceptibilities were tested in all isolates using the B460 system. The occurrence of MTB was found to be more common with a PVL >4 log(10) copies/ml (odds ratio: 4.6). Of 15 MTB isolates, 8 (53.3%) had single drug resistance, 4 (26.7%) had multidrug resistance (MDR) and 1 (6.7%) had resistance to three drugs (non-MDR). Two isolates (13.3%) were sensitive to all the four drugs. Resistance to first line anti-tuberculosis drugs was found to be higher among AIDS patients with MBT.

pub-1359	Molecular Characterization of Rifampicin- and Isoniazid-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Strains Isolated in Kazakhstan	Kazakhstan is one of the 14 countries with a high rate of morbidity due to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) in WHO European region. The aim of our study was to characterize mutations associated with drug resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Kazakhstan. M. tuberculosis strains were isolated from TB patients in different regions of Kazakhstan. A drug susceptibility test was performed on Lowenstein-Jensen medium using the absolute concentration method. Sequencing analysis was performed of the rpoB rifampicin resistance-determining region and the katG gene, the oxyR-ahpC intergenic region, and the inhA promoter region in 259 MDR M. tuberculosis isolates, in 51 isoniazid-resistant isolates, and in 13 rifampicin-resistant isolates. The mutational analysis revealed that the most frequent mutations associated with rifampicin and isoniazid resistance in M. tuberculosis are the substitutions at codons 531 (82.7%) and 315 (98.4%) in the rpoB and katG genes, respectively. In addition, we have found mutations with lower frequency at codons 526 (8.4%), 533 (1.5%), and 516 (1.1%) in the rpoB gene. In 6.2% of the isolates, no mutations were found in the rpoB gene. The findings of this study provide useful data for a better understanding of the mutation spectrum of isoniazid and rifampicin resistance among strains isolated from patients in Kazakhstan. Our results are also useful for the development of diagnostic tests of MDR M. tuberculosis.		
pub-1360	Outcome of standardized treatment for patients with MDR-TB from Tamil Nadu, India	Background & objectives: Programmatic management of MDR-TB using a standardized treatment regimen (STR) is being implemented under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) in India. This study was undertaken to analyse the outcomes of MDR-TB patients treated at the Tuberculosis Research Centre, Chennai, with the RNTCP recommended 24 months STR, under programmatic conditions. Methods: Patients failed to the category II re-treatment regimen and confirmed to have MDR-TB, were treated with the RNTCP's STR in a prospective field trial on a predominantly ambulatory basis. Thirty eight patients were enrolled to the trial from June 2006 to September 2007. Results: Time to culture conversion was two months or less for 82 per cent of patients. Culture conversion rates at 3 and 6 months were 84 and 87 per cent respectively. At the end of treatment, 25 (66%) were cured, 5 defaulted, 3 died and 5 failed. At 24 months, 30 (79%) patients, including 5 defaulters, remained culture negative for more than 18 months. Twenty two (58%) patients reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) which required dose reduction or termination of the offending drug. No patient had XDR-TB initially, but 2 failure cases emerged as XDR-TB during treatment. Interpretation & conclusions: Outcomes of this small group of MDR-TB patients treated with the RNTCP's STR is encouraging in this setting. Close attention needs to be paid to ensure adherence, and to the timely recognition and treatment of ADRs.

10.5588_ijtld.10.0199	Global survey of national tuberculosis drug policies	SETTING: National tuberculosis (TB) programmes (NTPs) in 100 countries. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between the estimated prevalence of multidrug resistance in previously untreated TB cases and policies regarding sales and distribution of TB drugs, particularly rifampicin (RMP). DESIGN: Questionnaire survey of national TB drug control policies, completed by NTP managers. Results were correlated with recent World Health Organization estimates of prevalence of drug resistance in new cases of TB. RESULTS: Questionnaires were received from 100 countries, including 88 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and 17 of the 22 high-burden countries. Current policies were considered adequate in only 40 of the 88 LMICs (45%). A higher prevalence of multidrug resistance was associated with fewer years of free availability of TB drugs from the NTP (P = 0.02) and more years of availability of RMP from providers or pharmacies outside the NTP (P = 0.02). Eleven of the 20 countries with the highest prevalence of multidrug resistance had inadequate policies governing sales and distribution of TB drugs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that policies regarding sales and distribution of TB drugs should receive more emphasis as part of the global strategy to control drug resistance.	tuberculosis; treatment; drug resistance; MDR-TB; drug policy	PRIVATE; PHARMACIES; MARKET
10.5588_ijtld.10.0400	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among previously treated patients in the Philippines	SETTING: Prior treatment has been associated with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in many settings. The Philippines ranks fifth among 27 priority countries for MDR-TB. OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of MDR-TB among previously treated patients referred for MDR screening and management. DESIGN: Descriptive study of the rate of MDR-TB among 4705 previously treated patients screened from 2003 to 2008. RESULTS: MDR-TB was present in 76% of 2438 screened patients who had positive cultures. The proportion of patients with MDR-TB was the same among patients referred from public or DOTS facilities and private or non-DOTS facilities. MDR-TB occurred most frequently among patients who failed treatment with the Category 2 regimen (97%), those who did not demonstrate culture conversion after 3 months of Category 2 treatment (91%), and Category 1 failures (83%). MDR-TB rates were respectively 78% and 57% for Category 2 relapse and return after default (RAD), and respectively 33% and 22% for Category 1 relapse and RAD. CONCLUSION: MDR-TB is frequent among previously treated patients in the Philippines. Screening with culture and drug susceptibility testing should be considered for these patients.

10.1016_j.jchromb.2011.03.017	Determination of moxifloxacin in dried blood spots using LC-MS/MS and the impact of the hematocrit and blood volume	Moxifloxacin (MFX) is a potential oral agent use in the treatment of multidrug-resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Due to variability in pharmacokinetics and in vitro susceptibility of causative bacteria, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of MFX is recommended. Conventional plasma sampling for TDM is facing logistical challenges, especially in limited resource areas, and dried blood spots (DBS) sampling may offer a chance to overcome this problem. The objective of this study was to develop a LC-MS/MS method for determination of MFX in dried blood spots (DOS) that is applicable for TDM. The influence of paper type, the hematocrit (Hct) and the blood volume per spot (V(b)) on the estimated blood volume in a disc (V(est)) was investigated. The extracts of 8 mm diameter discs punched out from DBS were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with cyanoimipramin as internal standard. The method was validated with respect to selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, recovery and stability. The effect of Hct and V(b) on LC-MS/MS analytical result was also investigated. The relationship between MFX concentrations in venous and finger prick DBS and those in plasma was clinically explored. V(est) was highly influenced by Hct while the effect of V(b) appeared to be different among paper types. Calibration curves were linear in the range of 0.05-6.00 mg/L with inter-day and intra-day precisions and biases of less than 11.1%. The recovery was 84.5, 85.1 and 92.6% in response to blood concentration of 0.15, 2.50 and 5.00 mg/L, respectively. A matrix effect of less than 11.9% was observed. MFX in DBS was stable for at least 4 weeks at room condition (temperature of 25 degrees C and humidity of 50%). A large range of Hct value produced a significant analytical bias and it can be corrected with resulting DOS size. A good correlation between DBS and plasma concentrations was observed and comparable results between venous DOS and finger prick DBS was attained. This fully validated method is suitable for determination of MFX in dried blood spot and applicable for TDM. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

10.1371_journal.pone.0019399	Characteristics and Treatment Outcomes of Patients with MDR and XDR Tuberculosis in a TB Referral Hospital in Beijing: A 13-Year Experience	Background: Information on treatment outcomes among hospitalized patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) are scarce in China. Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted this retrospective study to analyze the characteristics and treatment outcomes in MDR- and XDR-TB patients in the 309 Hospital in Beijing, China during 1996-2009. Socio-demographic and clinical data were retrieved from medical records and analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with poor treatment outcomes and Cox proportional hazards regression model was further used to determine risk factors associated with death in TB patients. Among the 3,551 non-repetitive hospitalized TB patients who had drug susceptibility testing (DST) results, 716 (20.2%) had MDR-TB and 51 (1.4%) had XDR-TB. A total of 3,270 patients who had medical records available were used for further analyses. Treatment success rates (cured and treatment completed) were 90.9%, 53.4% and 29.2% for patients with non-MDR-TB, patients with MDR-TB excluding XDR-TB and patients with XDR-TB, respectively. Independent risk factors associated with poor treatment outcomes in MDR-TB patients included being a migrant (adjusted OR = 1.77), smear-positivity at treatment onset (adjusted OR = 1.94) and not receiving 3 or more potentially effective drugs (adjusted OR = 3.87). Independent risk factors associated with poor treatment outcomes in XDR-TB patients were smear-positivity at treatment onset (adjusted OR = 10.42) and not receiving 3 or more potentially effective drugs (adjusted OR = 14.90). The independent risk factors associated with death in TB patients were having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (adjusted HR = 5.25) and having hypertension (adjusted HR = 4.31). Conclusions/Significance: While overall satisfactory treatment success for non-MDR-TB patients was achieved, more intensive efforts should be made to better manage MDR-and XDR-TB cases in order to improve their treatment outcomes and to minimize further emergence of so-called totally drug-resistant TB cases.

10.5761_atcs.oa.09.01531	Surgery Offers High Cure Rates in Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis	Purpose: Drug resistance has become a major problem in the treatment of tuberculosis, and pulmonary resection in combination with chemotherapy appears to be an effective measure for the treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the results of resection for multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed case files from January 2003 to December 2006 of 13 patients with MDR-TB underwent pulmonary resection. Results: Of 13 patients, 7 (53.9%) were sputum positive for mycobacterium tuberculosis preoperatively, though after surgery, they were sputum negative. Lobectomy was performed in 8 (61.5%) and pneumonectomy, in 5 (38.5%). In the lobectomy group, 2 patients had an additional superior segmentectomy and 1 had a middle lobectomy for other segmental or lobar lesions. Operative mortality was 7.6% (1/13). There were no late surgical deaths. In the early postoperative period, 3 patients had serious complications (postoperative bleeding, prolonged air leak, expansion deficit, bronchopleural fistula and empyema) that were resolved with surgery (morbidity 23.0%). The 12 patients who survived the operation received appropriate chemotherapy and were followed up for 24-37 months. None of the patients relapsed, and the overall cure rate was 92.3% (12/13). Conclusion: Even with high morbidity in the early post-operative period, surgery, in addition to medical therapy, offers higher cure rates than only medical therapy; however, meticulous preoperative evaluation of patients is needed.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; pulmonary resection; surgery	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; RESECTION

10.1016_j.meegid.2011.01.021	Characteristics of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Taiwan: A population-based study	A population-based study was performed to characterize the genotype and drug-resistant patterns of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Taiwan. From 2007 to 2008, we analyzed 494 MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates using spacer oligonucleotide typing and drug susceptibility testing. The majority of cases occurred in the age groups of 45-54 (24.3%) and >= 65 (23.1%). Of the 494 MDR isolates, 25.1% were resistant to ethambutol, 15.6% were resistant to streptomycin, 27.1% were resistant to all four first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs, 28.9% were resistant to ofloxacin, and 8.7% were extensively drug-resistant (XDR). Compared with the SpolDB4, 86 spoligotypes were identified in 492 isolates. We observed 427 (86.8%) isolates belonging to 49 known spoligotypes and 65 isolates (13.2%) in 37 undesignated spoligotypes. Beijing lineages (50.0%) were the predominant genotype, followed by Haarlem (18.2%) and East-African-Indian (EAI) (5.7%). Geographically, Beijing lineages were predominant in all regions, whereas Haarlem lineages were predominant only in the east (28.1%) and EAI (11.3%) only in the south. Beijing lineages are statistically associated with MDR in younger age groups and eastern Taiwan. Furthermore, we found that Beijing ST1 (46.1%), Haarlem3 ST50 (7.1%) and ST742 (4.7%), and EAI2_MANILA ST19 (3.9%) were the prevalent groups. Thus, continuous surveillance with more thorough genotyping and epidemiological investigation is crucial for the prevention of further dissemination, the determination of the temporal and spatial trends of multi-drug resistance, and the emergence of XDR-TB in Taiwan.

10.1128_JCM.02274_10	Genotypes and Characteristics of Clustering and Drug Susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates Collected in Heilongjiang Province, China	For the last decade China has occupied second place, after India, among the top five countries with high burdens of tuberculosis (TB). Heilongjiang Province is located in northeastern China. The prevalence of drug-resistant TB in Heilongjiang Province is higher than the average level in China. To determine the transmission characteristics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated in this area and their genetic relationships, especially among the Beijing family strains, we investigated their genotypes. From May 2007 to October 2008, 200 M. tuberculosis isolates from patients presenting pulmonary TB were analyzed by molecular typing using PCR-based methods: spacer-oligonucleotide typing (spoligotyping), Beijing family-specific PCR (detection of the deletion of region of difference 105 [RD105]), and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable-number tandem-repeat (MIRU-VNTR) analysis. Different combinations of MIRU-VNTR loci were evaluated to define the genotypes and clustering characteristics of the local strains. We found that Beijing family strains represented 89.5% of the isolates studied. However, the rates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis among Beijing and non-Beijing family strains were not statistically different. The 15-locus set is considered the optimal MIRU-VNTR locus combination for analyzing the M. tuberculosis strains epidemic in this area, while the 10-locus set is an ideal set for first-line molecular typing. We found that the clustering rate of all the M. tuberculosis isolates analyzed was 10.0% using the 15-locus set typing. We conclude that the Beijing family genotype is predominant and that highly epidemic TB and MDR TB are less likely associated with the active transmission of M. tuberculosis in the study area.

10.5588_ijtld.10.0259	Patients diagnosed with tuberculosis at death or who died during therapy: association with the human immunodeficiency virus	OBJECTIVES: To describe trends and risk factors for tuberculosis (TB) mortality. DESIGN: We calculated trends, identified patient characteristics associated with TB diagnosis at death or death during TB treatment, and described diagnostic procedures using the United States National TB Surveillance System for 1997-2005. RESULTS: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected TB patients had an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 4-11 for TB diagnosis at death (foreign-born non-Whites, aOR = 11) and of 3-19 for death during TB treatment vs. non-HIV-infected patients. Odds increased by age. Hispanic males had an aOR of 2 for TB diagnosis at death compared with female non-Hispanics. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients had a three times greater aOR of death during treatment than non-MDR patients. American Indians, Black females, residents in long-term care facilities, US-born patients, and non-HIV-infected homeless persons aged 25-44 years each had an aOR of 2 for mortality during treatment; 86% of pulmonary patients diagnosed at death had a chest radiograph, but 34% had no sputum smear or culture reported. CONCLUSION: During 1997-2005, controlling for age, HIV remained the characteristic with the greatest aOR for TB diagnosis at death or death during TB therapy. Race/ethnicity, country of birth and homelessness further increased the adjusted odds of death. Results show possible missed opportunities for TB diagnosis prior to death.	tuberculosis; mortality; HIV	ACTIVE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; HIV-ASSOCIATED TUBERCULOSIS; INFECTED PATIENTS; RISK-FACTORS; MORTALITY; SURVIVAL; ERA
10.5588_ijtld.09.0730	Drug resistance among tuberculosis patients attending diagnostic and treatment centres in Makassar, Indonesia	SETTING: Government tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic and treatment centres, Makassar, Indonesia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportions and patterns of resistance to commonly used TB drugs (isoniazid [INH], rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin) among pulmonary TB patients and assess potential risk factors for drug resistance. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. RESULTS: Of 657 recruited patients, 234 were culture-positive. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) results were available for 216 patients. Among these, 197 were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (145 new and 52 previously treated). Isolates from 89 new (61.4%) and 31 previously treated (59.6%) patients were susceptible to all four drugs. Resistance to INH was high among both patient groups (28.3% of new vs. 34.6% of previously treated). Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases accounted for respectively 4.1% and 19.2% of these patients. Resistance to >2 drugs was high among previously treated patients (19.2%). MDR-TB cases were more likely to have a history of excess alcohol use (adjusted OR 4.01, 95%CI 1.28-12.53) and previous TB treatment (adjusted OR 6.28, 95%CI 2.01-19.64). CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of previous treatment history, many culture-positive TB patients were infected with INH-resistant isolates, and a significant proportion of previously treated patients were infected with MDR-TB. Treating culture-positive TB patients, especially previously treated patients, based on DST results should therefore be considered.	tuberculosis; drug-resistant TB; MDR-TB; Makassar; Indonesia	STANDARD RETREATMENT REGIMEN; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; SUSCEPTIBILITY; PHILIPPINES; 1ST-LINE; RUSSIA
10.5588_ijtld.10.0397	Rapid detection of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis by multiplex allele-specific polymerase chain reaction	SETTING: Dr Cetrangolo Hospital, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a multiplex allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (MAS-PCR) to detect multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) clinical isolates and to describe the main mutations conferring resistance to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP). DESIGN: Drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates were tested to detect mutations using MAS-PCR. The genes involved were katG, inbA promoter and rpoB. RESULTS: Among 193 clinical isolates included in the study, 52.6% of the INH-resistant isolates presented a mutation in the katG (315) gene, 28.1% in the inhAP (-15) and 3.0% in both. For the rpoB gene, 60% of the RMP-resistant isolates showed a mutation in codon 531, 17.5% in 526 and 2.5% in 516. Results were compared with those obtained by sequencing, and 100% concordance was obtained for the detection of the mutation in katG (315), 94.1% for inhAP (-15), and 97.8% for rpoB. The global concordance between both methods was 98%. CONCLUSIONS: The MAS-PCR system allowed the simultaneous and rapid detection of approximately 80.0% of the drug-resistant clinical isolates. This method could be used as a rapid and simple screening tool to detect drug-resistant TB in clinical practice.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; MAS-PCR	ISONIAZID RESISTANCE; RIFAMPICIN-RESISTANCE; SOUTH-AFRICA; PCR; MUTATIONS; STRAINS; ASSAY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; SPECIMENS; RECOVERY
10.5588_ijtld.10.0140	Standardised second-line treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis during pregnancy	We describe the efficacy and outcome of standardised second-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) medications during pregnancy. Treatment outcomes of five pregnant women with documented multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) referred to the National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases from 2003 to 2009 were analysed in two categories, maternal and neonatal. Patients became pregnant during treatment for MDR-TB without any changes in their anti-tuberculosis regimen. None of them had any adverse effects during pregnancy and delivery. No adverse effects were observed in mothers or neonates. The treatment of MDR-TB during pregnancy with a standardised second-line regimen in this study population was safe, with an acceptable rate of treatment success.

10.1016_j.ijantimicag.2010.11.023	Detection of novel coupled mutations in the katG gene (His276Met, Gln295His and Ser315Thr) in a multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain from Chennai, India, and insight into the molecular mechanism of isoniazid resistance using structural bioinformatics approaches	This study reports on the structural basis of drug resistance targeting the katG gene in a multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strain with two novel mutations (His276Met and Gln295His) in addition to the most commonly reported mutation (Ser315Thr). A structural bioinformatics approach was used to predict the structure of the mutant KatG enzyme (MT). Subsequent molecular dynamics and docking studies were performed to explain the mechanism of isoniazid (INH) resistance. The results show significant conformational changes in the structure of MT leading to a change in INH binding residues at the active site, with a significant increase in the inhibition constant (Ki) of 5.67 mu m in the mutant KatG-isoniazid complex (MT-INH) compared with the wild-type KatG-isoniazid complex (WT-INH). In the case of molecular dynamics studies, root mean square deviation (RMSD) analysis of the protein backbone in simulated biological conditions revealed an unstable trajectory with higher deviations in MT throughout the simulation process (1 ns). Moreover, root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) analysis revealed an overall increase in residual fluctuations in MT compared with the wild-type KatG enzyme (WT), whilst the INH binding residues of MT showed a decreased fluctuation that can be observed as peak deviations. Hence, the present study suggests that His276Met, Gln295His and Ser315Thr mutations targeting the katG gene result in decreased stability and flexibility of the protein at INH binding residues leading to impaired enzyme function.

10.1016_j.ijid.2011.01.001	Increasing drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Sinaloa, Mexico, 1997-2005	Background: In 1997 the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) reported high proportions of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in three Mexican states: Sinaloa, Baja California, and Oaxaca. In 2006, we showed that resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs remained frequent in Sinaloa. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to describe drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) trends and to investigate the probability that patients acquire resistance to first-line anti-TB drugs on recurrence after treatment in Sinaloa. Methods: Sputum specimens were collected from patients diagnosed with TB at all the health care institutions of Sinaloa during 1997-2005. Isolates were tested for susceptibility to first-line drugs. Results: Among 671 isolates tested from 1997 to 2002, the overall resistance rate was 34.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 31.2-38.4) with a 1.2% increase per year (Chi-square = 4.258, p = 0.03906). The prevalence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) was 17.9% (95% CI 14.9-20.7) with a 1.2% increase per year (Chi-square = 8.352, p = 0.00385). Of 50 patients registered twice between 1997 and 2005, 15 were fully susceptible at first registration, of whom six (40%) acquired drug resistance. Of 35 cases with any drug resistance at first registration, 21 (60%) came to acquire resistance to at least one other drug. Conclusions: The proportion of drug-resistant TB increased during 1997-2005 in Sinaloa. Major efforts are needed to prevent the further rise and spread of drug-resistant and MDR TB.

10.1007_s12098_010_0344_2	Multi-drug Resistant Childhood Tuberculosis	Emergence of drug resistant tuberculosis is one of the major challenges faced by health community globally. Tuberculosis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among children in endemic areas, yet little is known regarding epidemiology of pediatric tuberculosis and even far lesser information is available about epidemiology, diagnosis, management and treatment outcome of drug resistant tuberculosis in children. Despite limited data and difficulties in its management, drug resistant tuberculosis can be successfully treated even in resource poor settings with proper use of existing technologies. A high index of suspicion and early drug susceptibility testing is the key to early diagnosis and good treatment outcome. Difficulties in establishing the diagnosis, drug toxicities and absence of pediatric formulations add challenges to the management of Pediatric MDR TB Cases. Active research is required to answer the unresolved issues of finding optimal diagnostic tools, treatment regimens and duration and chemoprophylaxis in pediatric drug resistant tuberculosis.

10.3109_00365548.2010.548080	Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis at a tuberculosis specialist hospital in Shanghai, China: Clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes	Background: Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has recently emerged as a global public health problem. The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics, management and outcomes of human immunodeficiency virus-negative patients with XDR-TB at a specialist TB hospital in Shanghai, China. Methods: From July 2007 to June 2009 we analyzed TB patients with culture-proven XDR-TB at a specialist TB hospital in Shanghai. Results: Among 1156 TB cases, all culture-positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, 494 cases (42.7%) were classified as MDR-TB; 126 cases (10.9%) were XDR-TB. At least 3 lung fields were involved in 90.5% of XDR-TB patients and in 80.7% of other MDR-TB patients (p == 0.008). Of the XDR-TB cases, 40.5% were complicated by diabetes and other diseases, significantly higher compared with the other MDR-TB cases (p == 0.002). The rates of resistance to all drugs except isoniazid and rifampicin were significantly higher in patients with XDR-TB than in patients with other MDR-TB (p < 0.001). Treatment failure was more common in patients with XDR-TB than in those with other MDR-TB (p < 0.001), whereas the mortality and default rates did not differ significantly. Conclusions: The prevalence of XDR-TB is high in some areas of China. The clinical treatment outcome for XDR-TB is usually very poor.

10.1007_s10096_010_1125_6	Contribution of rural-to-urban migration in the prevalence of drug resistant tuberculosis in China	Increased drug resistance rates to the first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs and multidrug resistance (MDR) were observed in China. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence and risk factors for drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in urban China and, more specifically, to determine the contribution of migration to case burden and drug resistance rates of urban cities. A facility-based epidemiological study of all active TB patients reported in the four districts of Shanghai and Ningbo between April 1, 2008 and March 31, 2009 was conducted. Residents had significantly higher drug-resistance rates than migrants (any drug resistance: 29.8% vs. 23.5%, respectively, P = 0.038; MDR: 10.9% vs. 6.1%, P = 0.048). Previously treated migrant patients were more likely to harbor drug-resistant TB and MDR-TB than new migrant cases, with adjusted odds ratios of 3.85 and 6.52, respectively. In total, 46.2% of the previously treated cases were resistant to INH, 38.5% to SM, 33.3% to RMP and 30.8% to EMB, while 13.1%, 17.5%, 7.0% and 6.8% of new cases were resistant to the four agents, respectively. To prevent the transmission of drug-resistant TB among migrants and residents, improved case management and appropriate treatment regimens should be sustained to prevent acquired drug resistance.

10.1371_journal.pone.0017556	Sterilizing Activity of Second-Line Regimens Containing TMC207 in a Murine Model of Tuberculosis	Rationale: The sterilizing activity of the regimen used to treat multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) has not been studied in a mouse model. Objective and Methods: Swiss mice were intravenously inoculated with 6 log10 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) strain H37Rv, treated with second- line drug combinations with or without the diarylquinoline TMC207, and then followed without treatment for 3 more months to determine relapse rates (modified Cornell model). Measurements: Bactericidal efficacy was assessed by quantitative lung colony- forming unit (CFU) counts. Sterilizing efficacy was assessed by measuring bacteriological relapse rates 3 months after the end of treatment. Main Results: The relapse rate observed after 12 months treatment with the WHO recommended MDR TB regimen (amikacin, ethionamide, pyrazinamide and moxifloxacin) was equivalent to the relapse rate observed after 6 months treatment with the recommended drug susceptible TB regimen (rifampin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide). When TMC207 was added to this MDR TB regimen, the treatment duration needed to reach the same relapse rate dropped to 6 months. A similar relapse rate was also obtained with a 6- month completely oral regimen including TMC207, moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide but excluding both amikacin and ethionamide. Conclusions: In this murine model the duration of the WHO MDR TB treatment could be reduced to 12 months instead of the recommended 18- 24 months. The inclusion of TMC207 in the WHO MDR TB treatment regimen has the potential to further shorten the treatment duration and at the same time to simplify treatment by eliminating the need to include an injectable aminoglycoside. dd		MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; MICROBIAL ENUMERATION TECHNIQUE; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS; MOUSE TISSUES; MOXIFLOXACIN; PYRAZINAMIDE; INFECTION; THERAPY; R207910
pub-1381	Prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among Category II pulmonary tuberculosis patients	Background & objectives: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has emerged as a significant global health concern. The most important risk factor for the development of MDR-TB is previous anti-tuberculosis therapy. Category H pulmonary TB includes those patients who had failed previous TB treatment, relapsed after treatment, or defaulted during previous treatment. We carried out this study to ascertain the prevalence of MDR-TB among category II pulmonary TB patients. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study involving category II pulmonary TB patients diagnosed between 2005 and 2008. All sputum-positive category II TB cases were subjected to mycobacterial culture and drug-susceptibility testing (DST). MDR-TB was defined as TB caused by bacilli showing resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. Results: A total of 196 cases of sputum-positive category II pulmonary tuberculosis patients were included. Of these, 40 patients (20.4%) had MDR-TB. The mean age of MDR-TB patients was 33.25 +/- 12.04 yr; 9 patients (22.5%) were female. Thirty six patients showed resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid; while 4 patients showed resistance to rifampicin, isoniazid and streptomycin. The prevalence of MDR-TB among category-II pulmonary tuberculosis patients was 20.4 per cent. Interpretation & conclusions: The prevalence of MDR-TB in category H TB patients was significant. However, nation-wide and State-wide representative data on prevalence of MDR-TB are lacking. We stress the importance of continuous monitoring of drug resistance trends, in order to assess the efficacy of current interventions and their impact on the TB epidemic.

10.1016_S0213_005X_11_70016_7	Advances in rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis disease and anti-tuberculous drug resistance	Rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug-resistant (resistance to at least rifampin and isoniazid) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is one of the cornerstones for global TB control as it allows early epidemiological and therapeutic interventions. The slow growth of the tubercle bacillus is the greatest obstacle to rapid diagnosis of the disease. However, considerable progress has recently been made in developing novel diagnostic tools, especially molecular methods (commercial and 'in-house'), for direct detection in clinical specimens. These methods, based on nucleic acid amplification (NAA) of different targets, aim to identify the M. tuberculosis complex and detect the specific chromosome mutations that are most frequently associated with phenotypic resistance to multiple drugs. In general, commercial methods are recommended since they have a better level of standardization, reproducibility and automation. Although some aspects such as cost-efficiency and the appropriate setting for the implementation of these techniques are not yet well established, organizations such as the WHO are strongly supporting the implementation and universal use of these new molecular methods. This chapter summarizes current knowledge and the available molecular methods for rapid diagnosis of TB and anti-tuberculous drug resistance in clinical microbiology laboratories.

10.1016_j.meegid.2010.12.010	Determination of drug susceptibility patterns and genotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Kanpur district, North India	Background and objectives: Molecular typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates has greatly facilitated the understanding of tuberculosis epidemiology. This study was done to characterize prevalent M. tuberculosis genotypes in a defined area of Kanpur district, North India by spoligotyping and IS6110-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) and to correlate the genotypes identified with their drug susceptibility patterns. Methods: Ninety-eight patients had clinical features suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and out of them, 22 were new smear positive PTB (CAT I DOTS), 48 smear positive re-treatment, defaulters and CAT I failure PTB (CAT II DOTS) and 28 new smear negative PTB (CAT III). Out of them, sputum culture was positive for M. tuberculosis in 74 cases. DNA was extracted from growth on Lowenstein-Jensen slants and subjected to spoligotyping. Clusters were subsequently analyzed with IS6110 RFLP. Drug susceptibility testing was done for rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, ofloxacin, streptomycin and kanamycin. Results: Thirty-seven spoligo patterns were observed. Predominant spoligotypes belonged to Central Asian Delhi family (33.78%), Beijing family (10.8%), East African-Indian family (5.4%), T1 family (5.4%) and U family (4.1%). RFLP analysis revealed 66% isolates had more than 10 IS6110 copies while 17% isolates each had low (1-5) and intermediate (6-9) copy numbers. All the isolates clustered by spoligotyping were identified unique by RFLP. Resistance to at least one drug was present in 35 (47.3%), out of which 8 patients belonged to CAT I and 27 to CAT II. Eleven (14.86%) were multi drug-resistant (MDR) and out of them, 6(54.5%) isolates were of ST1/Beijing family. MDR-TB was significantly higher in Beijing strain than others (p < 0.0001), however, most (83%) were from previously treated cases and thus can not be linked with recent transmission. Conclusion: This approach of molecular typing appears promising and merits further evaluation to study dynamics of TB transmission specially in India. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

pub-1384	Molecular Detection of Rifampicin Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis: An Urban Study	Objective: The detection of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) by broth method requires eight weeks. Molecular technique shortens the duration and it is able to detect the, resistant gene. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of using molecular technique to detect MDR-TB compared to broth method. Materials and methods: Samples were collected from 726 patients suspected to have tuberculosis throughout the year 2008 in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC). Growth on Lowenstein-Jensen media were confirmed as Mycobacterium tuberculosis using BDProbeTec (TM) ET Mycobacterium and susceptibility testing was performed using BACTEC (TM) MGIT (TM) 960. The 411bp fragment of rpo gene was amplified and sequenced. Results: Fifty of the 726 samples (6.89%) grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. MDR was detected in four of the 50 (8%) isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The sensitivity of molecular technique in detecting MDR-TB was 25% with a specificity of 100%. The positive predictive value was 100% whereas negative predictive value was 89.66%. Conclusion: Molecular technique was not an effective screening test for MDR-TB due to the low sensitivity.	drug resistance; microbiology; molecular; rpo gene; tuberculosis	DRUG-RESISTANCE; RISK-FACTORS; POLYMERASE
10.1097_MJT.0b013e3181c0806d	Adverse Effects of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment With a Standardized Regimen: A Report From Iran	Compared with the treatment of drug-sensitive tuberculosis, the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is more difficult. This study was conducted at the national referral center of tuberculosis in Tehran, Iran, to evaluate adverse drug reactions of treatment of MDR-TB. From 2006 to 2009, all patients admitted into Masih Daneshvari Hospital in Tehran, Iran, for MDR-TB were considered for this study. The standard treatment for MDR-TB consisted of amikacin, prothionamide, ofloxacin, and cycloserine. Ethambutol and pyrazinamide were added to treatment if mycobacterium was sensitive to them. All adverse effects observed in patients were recorded in our registry. Eighty patients were considered in the study; of this cohort, 44 were male and 36 were female. The mean age of patients was 40.64 +/- 17.53 years (range, 14-81 years). All patients received standardized therapy for MDR-TB. The major adverse effects included neurologic side effects (depression, convulsions, consciousness, psychosis, suicide; 7.5%), hepatitis (5%), rash (1.3%), renal toxicity (3.8%), and auditory toxicity (14.5%). Those with neurologic side effects had less favorable outcome (P value = 0.038) and risk of death was increased among them (odds ratio, 13.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.2-86.77). Other adverse effects did not show statistical significance in our analysis. A major adverse effect such as neurologic side effects (depression, convulsions, consciousness, and psychosis) can result in an increased chance of death among patients with MDR-TB.	adverse effects; MDR-TB; standard regimen	ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS; MDR-TB; MANAGEMENT; THERAPY
10.3201_eid1703.101553	Targeted Drug-Resistance Testing Strategy for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Detection, Lima, Peru, 2005-2008	The Peruvian National Tuberculosis Control Program issued guidelines in 2006 specifying criteria for culture and drug-susceptibility testing (DST), including district-level rapid DST. All patients referred for culture and DST in 2 districts of Lima, Peru, during January 2005-November 2008 were monitored prospectively. Of 1,846 patients, 1,241 (67.2%) had complete DST results for isoniazid and rifampin; 419 (33.8%) patients had multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB at the time of referral. Among patients with new smear-positive TB, household contact and suspected category I failure were associated with MDR TB, compared with concurrent regional surveillance data. Among previously treated patients with smear-positive TB, adult household contact, suspected category II failure, early relapse after category I, and multiple previous TB treatments were associated with MDR TB, compared with concurrent regional surveillance data. The proportion of MDR TB detected by using guidelines was higher than that detected by a concurrent national drug-resistance survey, indicating that the strategy effectively identified patients for DST.

10.1007_s00284_010_9770_7	Nature-inspired Novel Drug Design Paradigm Using Nanosilver: Efficacy on Multi-Drug-Resistant Clinical Isolates of Tuberculosis	Despite discovery of the pathogen more than 100 years ago, tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a major killer disease worldwide. Currently a third of world population is infected and multiple-drug-resistant (mdr) TB registers maximum mortality by a single pathogen. Nanomedicine provides enormous opportunity for developing novel drugs. We have recently demonstrated surface-modified-lipophilic-nanosilica as drug to combat malaria and 100% lethal virus, BmNPV. Nanosilver possesses inherent antibacterial properties, but toxicity is a major concern. We hypothesized that capping with nature-inspired biomolecules, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Poly-n-vinyl-pyrrolidone (PVP) used as blood volume extender, might insure biosafety. BSA-nano-Ag was found to be more stable than PVP-nano-Ag at physiological pH. In this first ever study on clinical isolates collected from TB endemic areas, we report, BSA-nano-Ag act as potent anti-TB drug. Further study with (human serum albumin)-nano-Ag and core-shell-nano-Ag could increase the biocompatibility of oral TB drug formulations without compromising on the efficacy of the drug.

pub-1388	inhA promoter mutations: a gateway to extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa?	SETTING: Western Cape and Eastern Cape Provinces, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential association between the evolution of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and mutations in the inhA promoter or the katG gene. DESIGN: Analysis of the frequency distribution of isoniazid (INH) resistance conferring mutations in a population sample of drug-resistant isolates of M. tuberculosis. RESULTS: In the Western Cape and Eastern Cape Provinces, the percentage of isolates exhibiting inhA promoter mutations increased significantly from respectively 48.4% and 62.4% in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates to 85.5% and 91.9% in XDR isolates. Data from the Western Cape revealed that significantly more XDR-TB isolates showed mutations in the inhA promoter than in katG (85.5% vs. 60.9%, P < 0.01), while the respective proportions were equal for INH-resistant non-MDR-TB isolates (similar to 30%). CONCLUSIONS: inhA promoter mutations are strongly associated with XDR-TB in South Africa. We suggest that this is due to the dual resistance to ethionamide and (low-dose) INH conferred by inhA promoter mutations. The use of molecular probe assays such as the GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay, which allows the detection of inhA promoter mutations, could enable treatment regimens to be adjusted depending on the pharmacogenetic properties of the mutations detected.	drug resistance; SNP; MDR-TB; katG; MTBDRplus	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; WESTERN-CAPE; STRAIN; PYRAZINAMIDE; ETHIONAMIDE; SPREAD; GENE; TB
pub-1389	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is associated with low plasma concentrations of human neutrophil peptides 1-3	SETTING: Human neutrophil peptides 1, 2 and 3 (HNP1-3) are involved in innate host defence and acquired immune response, which is possibly associated with the genesis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between HNP1-3 and MDR-TB. DESIGN: We divided 42 patients with post-primary pulmonary TB into two groups according to their drug susceptibility test results: the drug-susceptible group (n = 21) and the MDR-TB group (n = 21). The concentration of HNP1-3 in the plasma of all specimens was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before treatment and 6, 18 and 24 months after. Duration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum and peripheral blood neutrophil counts were measured at the same time. RESULTS: Before treatment, the plasma HNP1-3 concentration in the MDR-TB group was lower than that of healthy controls and the drug-susceptible group. After treatment, plasma HNP1-3 concentrations were higher than pre-treatment levels in the MDR-TB group, but were still lower than in healthy controls or the drug-susceptible group. The concentration of HNP1-3 was negatively correlated with the duration of M. tuberculosis in sputum, while it was positively correlated with neutrophils. CONCLUSION: MDR-TB is associated with low plasma concentrations of HNP1-3.	human neutrophil peptides 1, 2 and 3 (HNP1-3); pulmonary tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; neutrophil	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DEFENSINS; PROTEINS; FLUID; CELLS

pub-1391	Moxifloxacin and pyrazmamide susceptibility testing in a complex case of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a public health problem of global concern. It is critical that drug susceptibility testing (DST) methods accurately predict clinical response. We present a patient with a challenging case of MDR-TB with additional resistance to quinolones and pyrazinamide. Treatment with a regimen including high-dosage moxifloxacin, based on additional genotypic and phenotypic DST, produced excellent results. This case highlights the possibility of treatment with high-dose fluoroquinolones despite apparent bacterial resistance to these agents. Improved DST methods are necessary for both agents. Development of genotypic approaches may offer a susceptibility profile rapidly, enabling early introduction of individualised treatments.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; fluoroquinolones; pyrazinamide	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; TUBERCLE-BACILLI; MUTATIONS
10.1007_s10096_010_1096_7	Outcome of hospitalized MDR-TB patients: Israel 2000-2005	MDR-TB has emerged in Israel following an immigrations wave from the Former Soviet Union (FSU) and Ethiopia. The purpose of this study was to outline characteristics and outcome of hospitalized MDR-TB patients. We retrospectively summarized charts of MDR-TB patients hospitalized in the national referral tuberculosis centers from January 2000 to December 2005, and followed them for 2 years. One hundred thirty-two patients were identified with a median age of 40 years and male predominance (77%). The majority of the patients were immigrants from FSU (83%) and Ethiopia (7.6%). They were characterized by alcohol (25.8%) and IV drug abuse (23.5%), presented with advanced disease manifested by hypoalbuminemia (50.8%) and smear positivity (70.5%). Cure was achieved in 50.3% and 30.4% died. Factors independently associated with death were patients' age (OR = 1.036 for each year, 95%CI 1.0-1.1, p = 0.014), hypoalbuminemia (OR = 2.95, 95%CI 1.1-7.6, p = 0.025), smear positivity at diagnosis (OR = 3.7, 95%CI 1.2-11.4, p = 0.023), alcohol abuse (OR = 4.8, 95%CI 1.7-13.7, p = 0.004) and XDR-TB resistance pattern (OR 8.3, 95%CI 1.5-44.6, p = 0.014). This study brings out the poor prognosis of a highly vulnerable immigration population. Efforts should be focused on earlier diagnosis and treatment in a well controlled hospital environment and to professional support groups to attend to this population's special needs.

pub-1393	Drug resistance patterns in pulmonary tuberculosis	Objective: To determine the resistance patterns of mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates among category I and II patients of pulmonary tuberculosis. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted at the Department of Medicine, Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences Jamshoro, from November 2008 to September 2009. Patients were divided into category I and II. The sputa were collected, stained with Ziehl-Nielsen (Z-N) staining and ultimately inoculated on Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) media for six weeks. Out of 890 pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients, the growth was obtained in 285 cases. The Drug sensitivity testing (DST) for Isoniazid (INH), Rifampicin (RIF), Ethambutol (EMB) Pyrazinamide (PZA) and Streptomycin (SM) were performed. The data was analyzed on SPSS 10.0. A p-value of <0.05 was taken as significant. Result: Out of 285 cases, 176 (61.75%) were male and 109 (38.24%) female. The mean age was 37 +/- 19.90 years. The DST showed drug sensitive and drug resistant isolates in 80 (28.05%) and 205 (71.92%) cases respectively (p=0.001). The drug resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) rates for individual drugs; INH, RIF, EMB, PZA and SM were 51,22%, 15.4%, 13.33%, 9%12, and 3.85% respectively (p=0.03). The MDR-TB isolates were detected in 120 (42.10%) cases, including 5 (5.88%) in category I and 115 (57.50%) in category II patients (p=0.0001). Conclusion: Drug resistant and multidrug resistant tuberculosis was observed mainly in category II patients. However, primary MDR was also observed in category I patients and reflects dissemination of MDR cases within the community.

pub-1394	Prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among newly diagnosed cases of sputum-positive pulmonary tuberculosis	Background & objectives: The prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is increasing throughout the world. Although previous treatment for TB is the most important risk factor for development of MDR-TB, treatment-naive patients are also at risk due to either spontaneous mutations or transmission of drug-resistant strains. We sought to ascertain the prevalence of MDR-TB among new cases of sputum-positive pulmonary TB. Methods: This was a prospective, observational study involving newly diagnosed cases of sputum-positive pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosed between 2008 and 2009 carried out in New Delhi, India. All sputum-positive TB cases were subjected to mycobacterial culture and first-line drug-susceptibility testing (DST). MDR-TB was defined as TB caused by bacilli showing resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. Results: A total of 218 cases of sputum-positive pulmonary tuberculosis were enrolled between 2008 and 2009. Of these, 41 cases had negative mycobacterial cultures and DST was carried out in 177 cases. The mean age of the patients was 27.8 +/- 10.2 yr; 59 patients (27%) were female. All patients tested negative for HIV infection. Out of 177 cases, two cases of MDR-TB were detected. Thus, the prevalence of MDR-TB among newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis patients was 1.1 per cent. Interpretation & conclusions: MDR-TB prevalence is low among new cases of sputum-positive pulmonary TB treated at primary care level in Delhi. Nation-wide and State-wide representative data on prevalence of MDR-TB are lacking. Efforts should be directed towards continued surveillance for MDR-TB among newly diagnosed TB cases.

10.1007_s12098_010_0298_4	Changing Trends in Childhood Tuberculosis	Several changes have been observed in the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic modalities and treatment of tuberculosis. Emergence of HIV epidemic and drug resistance have posed significant challenges. With increase in the number of diseased adults and spread of HIV infection, the infection rates in children are likely to increase. It is estimated that in developing countries, the annual risk of tuberculosis infection in children is 2.5%. Nearly 8-20% of the deaths caused by tuberculosis occur in children. Extra pulmonary tuberculosis has increased over last two decades. HIV infected children are at an increased risk of tuberculosis, particularly disseminated disease. In last two decades, drug resistant tuberculosis has increased gradually with emergence of MDR and XDR-TB. The rate of drug resistance to any drug varied from 20% to 80% in different geographic regions. Significant changes have occurred in TB diagnostics. Various diagnostic techniques such as flourescence LED microscopy, improved culture techniques, antigen detection, nucleic acid amplification, line probe assays and IGRAs have been developed and evaluated to improve diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis. Serodiagnosis is an attractive investigation but till date none of the tests have desirable sensitivity and specificity. Tests based on nucleic acid amplification are a promising advance but relatively less experience in children, need for technical expertise and high cost are limiting factors for their use in children with tuberculosis. Short-course chemotherapy for childhood tuberculosis is well established. Directly observed treatment strategy (DOTS) have shown encouraging result. DOTS plus strategy has been introduced for MDR TB.

10.1016_j.prrv.2010.09.010	Management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in children: a survival guide for paediatricians	WHO estimated that of 9.4 million cases of tuberculosis (TB) worldwide in 2008, 440,000 (3.6%) had multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB. Childhood TB is estimated at 10-15% of the total burden, but little is known about the burden of MDR-TB in children. Children in close contact with MDR-TB cases are likely to become infected with the same resistant strains and are vulnerable to develop disease. Although MDR-TB is a microbiological diagnosis, children should be treated empirically according to the drug susceptibility result of the likely source case, as often cultures cannot be obtained from the child. MDR-TB treatment in children is guided by the same principles, using the same second-line drugs as in adults, with careful monitoring for adverse effects. Co-infection with HIV poses particular challenges and requires early initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Preventive therapy for high-risk MDR-TB contacts is necessary, but no consensus guidance exists on how best to manage these cases. Pragmatic and effective Infection control measures are essential to limit the spread of MDR-TB. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

10.1186_1471_2458_11_110	Epidemiology of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in a chinese population: current situation and challenges ahead	Background: Drug resistance has been a cause of concern for tuberculosis (TB) control in both developed and developing countries. Careful monitoring of the patterns and trends of drug resistance should remain a priority. Methods: Strains were collected from 1824 diagnosed sputum smear positive pulmonary TB patients in Jiangsu province of China and then tested for drug susceptibility against rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and streptomycin. The prevalence and patterns of drug resistance in mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates were investigated. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors for multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterial infection. The strength of association was estimated by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Results: The drug susceptibility tests showed that 1077(59.05%) MTB strains were sensitive to all the four antibiotics and the other 747(40.95%) strains were resistant to at least one drug. The proportions of mono-drug resistance were 28.73% for isoniazid, 19.41% for rifampicin, 29.33% for streptomycin, and 13.98% for ethambutol, respectively. The prevalence of MDR-TB was 16.61%, which was significantly different between new cases (7.63%) and those with previous treatment history (33.07%). Geographical variation of drug resistance was observed, where the proportion of MDR-TB among new cases was higher in the central (9.50%) or north part (9.57%) than that in the south area (4.91%) of Jiangsu province. The age of patients was significantly associated with the risk of drug resistance (P < 0.001) and the adjusted OR (95% CI) was 1.88(1.26-2.81) for patients aged 35-44 years when compared with those 65 years or older. Patients with previous treatment history had a more than 5-fold increased risk of MDR-TB (adjusted OR: 6.14, 95% CI: 4.61-8.17), compared with those previously not having been treated. Conclusions: The high prevalence of drug resistance has been a major challenge for TB control. Prevention and control of drug-resistant TB should be emphasized by the revised DOTS (direct observed therapy, short course) program through prompt case detection, routine and quality-assured drug susceptibility test for patients at high risk of resistance, programmatic treatment with both first and second-line medicines, and systematic treatment observation, with priority for high MDR-TB settings.

10.1002_cmdc.201000490	Pyrido[1,2-a]benzimidazole-Based Agents Active Against Tuberculosis (TB), Multidrug-Resistant (MDR) TB and Extensively Drug-Resistant (XDR) TB	The struggle against tuberculosis (TB) is still far from over. TB, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is one of the deadliest infections worldwide. Co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) strains have further increased the burden for this disease. Herein, we report the discovery of 2-(4-chlorobenzyl)-3-methyl-1-oxo-1H,5H-pyrido[1,2-a]benzimidazole-4-carbonitrile as an effective antitubercular agent and the structural modifications of this molecule that have led to analogues with improved potency and lower toxicity. A number of these derivatives were also active at sub-micromolar concentrations against resistant TB strains and devoid of apparent toxicity to Vero cells, thereby underscoring their value as novel scaffolds for the development of new anti-TB drugs.	benzimidazole derivatives; drug design; drug discovery; drug resistance; tuberculosis	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DESIGN; SERIES; DERIVATIVES; INHIBITORS; PIPELINE; GROWTH
10.1111_j.1440_1843.2010.01902.x	Increased prevalence of primary drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis in immunocompromised patients	Background and objective: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is difficult and expensive to treat, and is associated with a higher rate of mortality. We conducted a long-term survey to compare the prevalence of primary drug-resistance, adverse effects of drugs and duration of treatment in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Factors associated with primary drug resistance were also investigated. Methods: The patients studied had culture-confirmed pulmonary TB but had not previously received anti-TB treatment. These patients were divided into immunocompetent (IMCPe) and immunocompromised (IMCPr) groups. Baseline data, the prevalence of DR-TB, duration of treatment and adverse effects of drugs were analysed. The rates of resistance to individual first-line anti-TB drugs in the two groups and in subgroups of the IMCPr group were calculated. Multinomial regression analysis was performed to investigate the risk factors associated with primary DR-TB. Results: Among the 394 patients, 159 (40.4%) were in the IMCPr group. The baseline data for the two groups were similar, except that the IMCPr group was slightly older. The prevalence of drug-resistance was higher in the IMCPr group (25.8% vs 17.0%, OR 1.69, 95% CI: 1.04-2.77), especially for isoniazid, rifampicin and streptomycin, and patients with liver cirrhosis, malignancies and those receiving immunosuppressants. The incidence of adverse drug effects was similar in the IMCPr and IMCPe groups. Multinomial regression analysis showed that being in the IMCPr group, and especially treatment with immunosuppressants, were independent risk factors for DR-TB. Conclusions: Immunocompromised patients with underlying diseases had an increased prevalence of primary pulmonary DR-TB but a similar incidence of drug-related adverse effects. Diagnosis and investigation of drug-resistance is important before initiating anti-TB treatment in this group of patients.	drug resistance; immunodeficiency; infection control; tuberculosis	RISK-FACTORS; MDR-TB; POPULATION; TURKEY

Methods: A retrospective study conducted among pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients from Oyo and Osun States in South West Nigeria who had their culture and drug susceptibility test performed at the institute of tropical medicine Antwerp, Belgium between 2007 and 2009. Data on the patient's characteristics were retrieved from the TB treatment card. Univariate analysis was perforated to assess the risk factors for drug resistant tuberculosis. The Level of significance was at P<0.05. Results: Among the 88 patients who had drug susceptibility test result, there were 50 males and 38 females. Of the 88 patients, 55 (62.5%) had strains resistant to at least one or more anti drugs. The proportion of TB cases with resistance to a single drug was 12.7%. The multi drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) rate was 76.4%. The only significant factor for the development of drug resistance and MDR was the history of previous anti TB treatment (P<0.01). Other factors such as age [OR 0.86 (0.35-2.13); P=0.721] and gender [OR 1.24 (0.49-3.14); P=0.62] were not significantly associated with drug resistance TB. Conclusions: The study highlighted a high prevalence of MDR TB among the study population. History of previous TB treatment was associated with MDR TB. There is an urgent need to conduct a national TB drug resistance survey to determine the actual burden and risk factors associated with drug resistance TB in the country.

pub-1401	Reliability of the MODS assay decentralisation process in three health regions in Peru	OBJECTIVE: To deliver rapid isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP) drug susceptibility testing (DST) close to the patient, we designed a decentralisation process for the microscopic observation drug susceptibility (MODS) assay in Peru and evaluated its reliability. METHODS: After 2 weeks of training, laboratory staff processed >= 120 consecutive sputum samples each in three regional laboratories. Samples were processed in parallel with MODS testing at an expert laboratory. Blinded paired results were independently analysed by the Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS) according to predetermined criteria: concordance for culture, DST against INH and RMP and diagnosis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) >= 95%, McNemar's P > 0.05, kappa index (kappa) >= 0.75 and contamination 1-4%. Sensitivity and specificity for MDR-TB were calculated. RESULTS: The accreditation process for Callao (126 samples, 79.4% smear-positive), Lima Sur (n = 130, 84%) and Arequipa (n = 126, 80%) took respectively 94, 97 and 173 days. Pre-determined criteria in all regional laboratories were above expected values. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting MDR-TB in regional laboratories were >95%, except for sensitivity in Lima Sur, which was 91.7%. Contamination was 1.0-2.3%. Mean delay to positive MODS results was 9.9-12.9 days. CONCLUSION: Technology transfer of MODS was reliable, effective and fast, enabling the INS to accredit regional laboratories swiftly.

10.2174_157018011794183860	Thioridazine: Alternative and Potentially Effective Therapy of the XDR-TB Patient	Pulmonary tuberculosis infections caused by multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis has progressed to extensively drug resistant status (XDR-TB). XDR-TB is very difficult to treat successfully and results in high mortality. Globally, XDR-TB is now a major threat, especially to India and countries that were once part of the Soviet Union. There is a potential alternative to current ineffective therapy that is solidly supported by in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies. It has reported successful therapies in 10 out of 12 non-responsive XDR-TB patients. That therapy is thioridazine, and it is the purpose of this mini-review to provide the rationale for thioridazine therapy, especially for compassionate reasons, when all other therapies have failed, depicting on extremely poor prognosis.

10.1186_1471_2334_11_28	High prevalence of childhood multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in Johannesburg, South Africa: a cross sectional study	Background: There are limited data on the prevalence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), estimated at 0.6-6.7%, in African children with tuberculosis. We undertook a retrospective analysis of the prevalence of MDR-TB in children with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) at two hospitals in Johannesburg, South Africa. Methods: Culture-confirmed cases of MTB in children under 14 years, attending two academic hospitals in Johannesburg, South Africa during 2008 were identified and hospital records of children diagnosed with drug-resistant TB were reviewed, including clinical and radiological outcomes at 6 and 12 months post-diagnosis. Culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB) was performed using the automated liquid broth MGIT (TM) 960 method. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed using the MGIT (TM) 960 method for both first and second-line anti-TB drugs. Results: 1317 children were treated for tuberculosis in 2008 between the two hospitals where the study was conducted. Drug susceptibility testing was undertaken in 148 (72.5%) of the 204 children who had culture-confirmed tuberculosis. The prevalence of isoniazid-resistance was 14.2% (n = 21) (95% CI, 9.0-20.9%) and the prevalence of MDR-TB 8.8% (n = 13) (95% CI, 4.8-14.6%). The prevalence of HIV co-infection was 52.1% in children with drug susceptible-TB and 53.9% in children with MDR-TB. Ten (76.9%) of the 13 children with MDR-TB received appropriate treatment and four (30.8%) died at a median of 2.8 months (range 0.1-4.0 months) after the date of tuberculosis investigation. Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis in children in Johannesburg in a setting with a high prevalence of HIV co-infection, although no association between HIV infection and MDR-TB was found in this study. Routine HIV and drug-susceptibility testing is warranted to optimize the management of childhood tuberculosis in settings such as ours.

10.1371_journal.pone.0016272	Social, Clinical and Microbiological Differential Characteristics of Tuberculosis among Immigrants in Spain	Background: To identify the differential tuberculosis (TB) characteristics within the immigrant population with respect to natives in Spain. Methodology/Principal Findings: A prospective cohort study design was implemented to examine the TB cases diagnosed and starting standard antituberculous treatment in Spain, between January 1st 2006 and March 31st 2007. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine differential characteristics. 1,490 patients were included in the study population, 1,048 natives and 442 (29.7%) immigrants. According to the multivariate analysis, the following variables were significantly associated with immigrant TB cases: younger age (OR = 3.79; CI:2.16-6.62), living in group situation (OR = 7.61; CI:3.38-12.12), lower frequency of disabled (OR:0.08; CI:0.02-0.26) and retired (OR:0.21; CI:0.09-0.48) employment status, lower frequency of pulmonary disease presentation (OR = 0.47; CI:0.24-0.92), primary or emergency care admission (OR = 1.80; CI:1.05-3.06 and OR = 2.16; CI:1.36-3.45), drug resistance (OR = 1.86; CI:1.01-3.46), treatment default (OR:2.12; CI:1.18-3.81), lower frequency of alcohol and cigarette consumption (OR = 2.10; CI:1.42-3.11 and OR = 2.85; CI: 2.10-3.87 respectively), more directly observed treatment (OR = 1.68; CI:1.04-2.69), and poor understanding of TB disease and its treatment (OR = 3.11; CI:1.86-5.20). The low percentage of primary MDR-TB in the native population (0.1% vs. 2.2% of immigrants) should be noted. Conclusions/Significance: The differences show the need to introduce specific strategies in the management of TB within the immigrant population, including the improvement of social and work conditions.

10.1371_journal.pone.0015841	Culture Conversion Among HIV Co-Infected Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients in Tugela Ferry, South Africa	Background: Little is known about the time to sputum culture conversion in MDR-TB patients co-infected with HIV, although such patients have, historically, had poor outcomes. We describe culture conversion rates among MDR-TB patients with and without HIV-co-infection in a TB-endemic, high-HIV prevalent, resource-limited setting. Methods: Patients with culture-proven MDR-TB were treated with a standardized second-line regimen. Sputum cultures were taken monthly and conversion was defined as two negative cultures taken at least one month apart. Time-to-conversion was measured from the day of initiation of MDR-TB therapy. Subjects with HIV received antiretroviral therapy (ART) regardless of CD4 count. Results: Among 45 MDR-TB patients, 36 (80%) were HIV-co-infected. Overall, 40 (89%) of the 45 patients culture-converted within the first six months and there was no difference in the proportion who converted based on HIV status. Median time-to-conversion was 62 days (IQR 48-111). Among the five patients who did not culture convert, three died, one was transferred to another facility, and one refused further treatment before completing 6 months of therapy. Thus, no patients remained persistently culture-positive at 6 months of therapy. Conclusions: With concurrent second-line TB and ART medications, MDR-TB/HIV co-infected patients can achieve culture conversion rates and times similar to those reported from HIV-negative patients worldwide. Future studies are needed to examine whether similar cure rates are achieved at the end of MDR-TB treatment and to determine the optimal use and timing of ART in the setting of MDR-TB treatment.

pub-1406	INVESTIGATION OF THE SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS COMPLEX STRAINS TO MAJOR ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS WITH BACTEC MGIT 960 SYSTEM	Objective: The study was designed to investigate retrospectively the resistance rates of tuberculosis-causing mycobacteria, isolated in the microbiology and clinical microbiology laboratories of Konya Research and Education Hospital. Material and Method: Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains were isolated from various clinical samples of 1666 patients applying to Konya Research and Education Hospital between May 2007 and December 2009, and the resistance rates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains against first generation anti tuberculosis drugs were investigated. After homogenization and decontamination, the samples investigated were cultured using BACTEC Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube-960 (MGIT-960) system. Susceptibility rates of the strains determined with production were investigated with the same system versus streptomycin (SM), Isoniazid (INH), Rifampin (RIF) and Ethambutol (ETB) (SIRE). Results: From 1666 patients prediagnosed with tuberculosis, 70 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains were isolated. While no drug resistance was found in 17 (24%) of them, resistance to one or two drugs was found in 26 (37%) strains (24% to INH, 20% to SM, 6% to ETB and 4% to RIF). While resistance was found to be only against one drugs in 15 of these (21%), two drugs in 11 of these (16%), no resistant strains could be determined against three or four drugs together Among the patients with resistance, 81% (57/70) displayed primary and 18% (13/70) secondary tuberculosis, and 2 patients were found to display resistance to isoniazid and rifampin together (MDR-TB). Conclosion: It was seen that the findings in the study were consistent with those determined by other studies in our country. Preventing the resistance to antituberculosis drugs is possible by enlightening the distribution rates of drug resistant strains in public, defining appropriate drug regimes and increasing the quality of tuberculosis control programs. Therefore, it is essential that regular and continuous scanning of antituberculosis drugs should be performed.

10.3906_kim_1006_689	Molecular modeling and antimycobacterial studies of Mannich bases: 5-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyran-4-ones	The World Health Organization lists tuberculosis among the top 3 leading causes of death from a single infectious agent, and reported cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are on the rise. In an attempt to improve MDR-TB drug-directed therapy, we synthesized 11 4-substituted piperazine derivatives of 3-hydroxy-6-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one pharmacophore by reacting 5-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one with suitable piperazine derivatives under Mannich reaction conditions. Inhibitory effects of the 11 compounds on Escherichia coli DNA gyrase were evaluated via DNA gyrase supercoiling assay. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the 11 compounds and 41 compounds from our previous studies against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37RV were assessed, in vitro, by a broth dilution method. To determine the interaction pattern between active site amino acids and all 52 compounds, homology modeling for the construction of M. tuberculosis DNA gyrase B subunit was performed, followed by a docking study. The data presented here could prove useful in future studies on interaction field analysis and high throughput virtual screening of the derivatives of the 3-hydroxy-6-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one pharmacophore toward the development of more clinically applicable compounds.

10.4415_ANN_11_04_18	The potential role of garlic (Allium sativum) against the multi-drug resistant tuberculosis pandemic: a review	Worldly data show the increasing incidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and particularly of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). In developing countries, TB control programmes are overwhelmed by the complexity of treating MDR-TB infected people, as current tools and therapies are inadequate. MDR-TB could become the main form of TB. Risk factors that make South Africa into one of the main epicentres are analysed. A review of the studies carried out about antitubercular properties of Allium sativum both in vitro and in vivo is provided. The researches about the garlic extracts effectiveness against clinical isolates of MDR-TB are of scientific importance. Allium sativum offers a hope for developing alternative drugs. The involvement of traditional healers (TH) in the TB health management could facilitate the administration of garlic extracts to the infected patients.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB); Allium sativum; traditional healers (TH); South Africa	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; HIV-INFECTION; ANTIMYCOBACTERIAL ACTIVITY; HUMAN MONOCYTES; MESSENGER-RNA; SOUTH-AFRICA; RISK-FACTORS; ALLICIN; EXTRACT; TRANSMISSION
10.1111_j.1752_699X.2009.00184.x	MDR- and XDR-TB among suspected drug-resistant TB patients in a tertiary care hospital in India	Aim: To study the anti-tubercular drug resistance pattern among suspected cases of drug-resistant TB. Materials and Methods: First and second line drug susceptibility data were retrospectively analysed for all suspected cases of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), presenting to the Pulmonary Medicine department of tertiary care hospital in South India from 2003 to 2007. Results and Discussion: Out of 177 cases of suspected drug-resistant TB, 103 (58.2%) cases were multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Out of 75 cases of MDR-TB for whom second-line drug susceptibility test was performed, 45 (60.0%) cases met the criteria of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB, which is very high when compared with existing worldwide data on XDR-TB (6.6% cases of MDR-TB). In comparison with non-MDR-TB cases, MDR and XDR-TB cases had a history of significantly higher duration of anti-TB treatment (ATT) and significantly higher exposure to multiple ATT regimens. Past exposure to second-line anti-TB drugs was significantly high in XDR-TB cases than in MDR-TB and non MDR-TB cases. Conclusion: This study highlights the high burden of XDR- and MDR-TB among TB patients coming to tertiary care hospitals in India.

10.3109_10717544.2010.509367	Pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution studies of orally administered nanoparticles encapsulated ethionamide used as potential drug delivery system in management of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis	Sustained release nanoformulations of second line anti-tubercular drugs can help in reducing their dosing frequency and improve patient's compliance in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). The objective of the current study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics and tissues distribution of ethionamide encapsulated in poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles. The drug loaded nanoparticles were 286 +/- 26 nm in size with narrow size distribution, and zeta-potential was -13 +/- 2.5 mV. The drug encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity were 35.2 +/- 3.1%w/w and 38.6 +/- 2.3%w/w, respectively. Ethionamide-loaded nanoparticles were administered orally to mice at two different doses and the control group received free (unencapsulated) ethionamide. Ethionamide-loaded PLGA nanoparticles produced sustained release of ethionamide for 6 days in plasma against 6 h for free ethionamide. The Ethionamide was detected in organs (lung, liver, and spleen) for up to 5-7 days in the case of encapsulated ethionamide, whereas free ethionamide was cleared within 12 h. Ethionamide-loaded PLGA nanoparticles exhibited significant improvement in pharmacokinetic parameters, i.e. C-max, t(max), AUC(0-infinity), AUMC(0-infinity), and MRT of encapsulated ethionamide as compared with free ethionamide. Drug in nanoparticles also exhibited a dose proportional increase in the AUC(0-infinity) values. The pharmacodynamic parameters such as AUC(0-24)/MIC, C-max/MIC, and Time > MIC were also improved. PLGA nanoparticles of ethionamide have great potential in reducing dosing frequency of ethionamide in treatment of MDR TB.

10.1017_S0950268810000907	Impact of malnutrition on clinical presentation, clinical course, and mortality in MDR-TB patients	Despite the adoption of strategies to prevent and treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) over the past decade, Latvia continues to have one of the highest rates of MDR-TB in the world. It is important to identify modifiable factors that may impact on MDR-TB patient outcomes. A study was conducted to elucidate the association between nutritional status and clinical presentation, clinical course, and mortality in 995 adult patients treated for MDR-TB from 2000 to 2004. Twenty percent of patients were underweight, defined as a body mass index <18.5, at the time of diagnosis. These patients were significantly more likely to have clinical evidence of advanced disease, and had a greater risk of experiencing >= 3 side-effects [ adjusted odds ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.1] and death (adjusted hazard ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.5) compared to patients who were normal or overweight. Interventions aimed at these high-risk patients, including nutritional supplementation as an adjunct to anti-TB therapy, should be considered and evaluated by TB programmes.

pub-1412	Performance comparison of four methods for detecting multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains	SETTING: National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory, Kuwait. OBJECTIVE: To compare Genotype MTBDRplus (gMTBDR(+)), INNO-LiPA Rif.TB (INNO-LiPA), polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and DNA sequencing for detecting rifampicin (RMP) and/or isoniazid (INH) resistance-associated mutations in the rpoB hot-spot region (HSRrpoB), the katG codon 315 (katG315) and the inhA regulatory region (inhA-RR) among multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates. DESIGN: A total of 82 MDR-TB and 43 pansusceptible M. tuberculosis BACTEC 460-characterised isolates were processed using molecular techniques and the Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960 system. RESULTS: All susceptible strains contained wild-type sequences in target genes. RMP resistance was detected in respectively 78,77 and 79 MDR-TB strains by gMTBDR(+), INNO-LiPA and HSR-rpoB sequencing. Two isolates with Ins514TTC mutation were detected as RMP-resistant by gMTBDR(+) but as RMP-susceptible by INNO-LiPA. One isolate with L533P mutation, detected as RMP-susceptible by gMTBDR(+), was detected as RMP-resistant by INNO-LiPA. Two of three isolates detected as RMP-susceptible by gMTBDR(+), INNO-LiPA, HSR-rpoB sequencing and the MGIT 960 system contained a I572F mutation that is outside HSR-rpoB. INH resistance was detected in respectively 76, 60, 60 and 22 MDR-TB strains by gMTBDR(+), katG315 PCR-RFLP, katG315 sequencing and inhA-RR sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: Although gMTBDR(+) accurately detected similar to 88% of MDR-TB strains, some rpoB mutations were either missed or were outside the region of analysis of the gMTBDR(+) assay.

pub-1413	Performance of culture and drug susceptibility testing in pulmonary tuberculosis patients in northern China	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a growing problem in China. In 2008, all smear-positive pulmonary TB patients in a city in northern China were expected to undergo routine culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST). We assessed the performance of this system. There were 915 patients, of whom 356 (39%) had culture performed; 275 (30%) had positive cultures and 236 (26%) had DST. Of the 236 patients with DST, 6% of new and 32% of previously treated patients had MDR-TB. Culture and DST is an important service for the correct management of patients, and solutions to improve the current system need to be considered.	culture; drug susceptibility testing; China; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	
pub-1414	The Incidence of Amikacin Ototoxicity in Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients	Amikacin has been shown to irreversibly suppress Cochlear activity. The aim of this study is to assess the incidence of amikacinototoxicity in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients and riskfactors associated withthis ototoxicity. In this cross-sectional study, 41 patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were included. All patients received fixed dose of intravenous amikacin(500 mg/day) and anti-TB medications for six months. Baseline Pure-Tone Audiometry (PTA) was performed on all patients,before and during the drug treatment with the frequency range between 250 Hz and 8000 Hz. Patients were closely observed for the occurrence of symptomatic ototoxicity using a questionnaire To find an association between the incidence of cochlear damage and patients' demographics, all patients' data were recorded. A total of 29 patients suffered from hearing loss (70.1%) (Male: n = 18; Female: n = 20). Using logistic regression, the incidence of amikacinototoxicity was higher in men than in women. There was a negative correlation between the duration of the amikacintreatment and the difference in hearing thresholds (r = -0.34, p = 0.03). The mean of hearing threshold was significantly increased before and after theamikacintreatment((23.68 +/- 19.26 vs. 38.93 +/- 22.80) (p<0.0001)). The incidence of hearing loss was remarkable in MDR-TB patients treating with amikacin. However, risk factors' determination and monitoring of audiometric result variations could have influenced the incidence of the amikacin ototoxicity.

10.3346_jkms.2011.26.1.33	Treatment Outcome and Mortality among Patients with Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis in Tuberculosis Hospitals of the Public Sector	This study was conducted to evaluate treatment outcome, mortality, and predictors of both in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) at 3 TB referral hospitals in the public sector of Korea. We included MDR-TB patients treated at 3 TB referral hospitals in 2004 and reviewed retrospectively their medical records and mortality data. Of 202 MDR-TB patients, 75 (37.1%) had treatment success and 127 (62.9%) poor outcomes. Default rate was high (37.1%, 75/202), comprising 59.1% of poor outcomes. Male sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-7.49), positive smear at treatment initiation (aOR, 5.50; 95% CI, 1.22-24.90), and extensively drug-resistant TB (aOR, 10.72; 95% CI, 1.23-93.64) were independent predictors of poor outcome. The all-cause mortality rate was 31.2% (63/202) during the 3-4 yr after treatment initiation. In conclusion, the treatment outcomes of patients with MDR-TB at the 3 TB hospitals are poor, which may reflect the current status of MDR-TB in the public sector of Korea. A more comprehensive program against MDR-TB needs to be integrated into the National Tuberculosis Program of Korea.

10.1016_j.medmal.2010.07.003	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis management in three French hospitals	Introduction. - Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) management is based on specific WHO guidelines. Objectives. - The authors report MDR-TB management, in three French hospitals. Method. - The authors retrospectively included patients with positive sample for multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (isoniazid + rifampicin) from January 1,2000 to December 31,2005. The management was compared to the French and international prevalent guidelines. Results. - Sixteen patients were initially managed for MDR-TB by eight different medical teams over 6 successive years: 12 (75%) presented with primary MDR-TB. Management advice from the national referee center (NRC) for tuberculosis was reported in seven out of 14 treated cases. The median length of the intensive treatment was 2 months (IQR: 1-3). Eight patients (58%) had an overall treatment length of 18 months. The median number of effective drugs prescribed was 4 (IQR: 4-5). Nine patients (64%) were also managed in a sanatorium. Only eight patients (57%) completed the prescribed treatment. Nine patients were clinically cured and still followed-up, six of whom were bacteriologically cured. Conclusion. - TB-MDR management was not conform to WHO guidelines in our study. Management in a sanatorium, NRC involvement, ambulatory DOT were highly beneficial. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

10.3414_ME09_01_0021	Options for Diabetes Management in Sub-Saharan Africa with an Electronic Medical Record System	Background: An increase of diabetes prevalence of up to 80% is predicted in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by 2025 exceeding the worldwide 55%. Mortality rates of diabetes and HIV/AIDS are similar. Diabetes shares several common factors with HIV/AIDS and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The latter two health problems have been efficiently managed by an open source electronic medical record system (EMRS) in Latin America. Therefore a similar solution for diabetes in SSA could be extremely helpful. Objectives: The aim was to design and validate a conceptual model for an EMRS to improve diabetes management in SSA making use of the HIV and TB experience. Methods: A review of the literature addressed diabetes care and management in SSA as well as existing examples of information and communication technology (ICT) use in SSA. Based on a need assessment conducted in SSA a conceptual model based on the traditionally structured healthcare system in SSA was mapped into a three-layer structure. Application modules were derived and a demonstrator programmed based on an open source EMRS. Then the approach was validated by SSA experts. Results: A conceptual model could be specified and validated which enhances a problem-oriented approach to diabetes management processes. The prototyp EMRS demonstrates options for a patient portal and simulation tools for education of health professional and patients in SSA. Conclusion: It is possible to find IT solutions for diabetes care in SSA which follow the same efficiency concepts as HIV or TB modules in Latin America. The local efficiency and sustainability of the solution will, however, depend on training and changes in work behavior.

pub-1418	ANTI-MYCOBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OF GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM) AGAINST MULTI-DRUG RESISTANT AND NON-MULTI-DRUG RESISTANT MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS	Emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB throughout the developing world is very disturbing in the present scenario of TB management. There is a fundamental need to explore alternative anti-TB agents. Hence natural plants should be investigated to understand their antimicrobial properties and safety. Garlic (Allium sativum) is one of natural plant which possesses variety of biological properties like anti-tumor, anti-hyperlipedemic and anti-microbial etc. The present study was evaluated for antibacterial activity of garlic against non-MDR and MDR isolates of M tuberculosis. A total of 20 clinical isolates of MTB including 15 MDR and 5 non-MDR were investigated. Ethanolic extract of garlic was prepared by maceration method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was performed by using 7H9 middle brook broth dilution technique. MIC of garlic extract was ranged from 1 to 3 mg/ml; showing inhibitory effects of garlic against both non-MDR and MDR M. tuberculosis isolates. Alternate medicine practices with plant extracts including garlic should be considered to decrease the burden of drug resistance and cost in the management of diseases. The use of garlic against MDR-TB may be of great importance regarding public health.	TB; MDR; resistance; Garlic; Anti-bacterial activity	INHIBITION; EXTRACT; PRODUCTS; ALLICIN
10.1371_journal.pone.0015735	Predictors of Multidrug- and Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in a High HIV Prevalence Community	Background: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) have emerged in high-HIV-prevalence settings, which generally lack laboratory infrastructure for diagnosing TB drug resistance. Even where available, inherent delays with current drug-susceptibility testing (DST) methods result in clinical deterioration and ongoing transmission of MDR and XDR-TB. Identifying clinical predictors of drug resistance may aid in risk stratification for earlier treatment and infection control. Methods: We performed a retrospective case-control study of patients with MDR (cases), XDR (cases) and drug-susceptible (controls) TB in a high-HIV-prevalence setting in South Africa to identify clinical and demographic risk factors for drug-resistant TB. Controls were selected in a 1: 1: 1 ratio and were not matched. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and performed multivariate logistic regression to identify independent predictors. Results: We enrolled 116, 123 and 139 patients with drug-susceptible, MDR, and XDR-TB. More than 85% in all three patient groups were HIV-infected. In multivariate analysis, MDR and XDR-TB were each strongly associated with history of TB treatment failure (adjusted OR 51.7 [CI 6.6-403.7] and 51.5 [CI 6.4-414.0], respectively) and hospitalization more than 14 days (aOR 3.8 [CI 1.1-13.3] and 6.1 [CI 1.8-21.0], respectively). Prior default from TB treatment was not a risk factor for MDR or XDR-TB. HIV was a risk factor for XDR (aOR 8.2, CI 1.3-52.6), but not MDR-TB. Comparing XDR with MDR-TB patients, the only significant risk factor for XDR-TB was HIV infection (aOR 5.3, CI 1.0-27.6). Discussion: In this high-HIV-prevalence and drug-resistant TB setting, a history of prolonged hospitalization and previous TB treatment failure were strong risk factors for both MDR and XDR-TB. Given high mortality observed among patients with HIV and drug-resistant TB co-infection, previously treated and hospitalized patients should be considered for empiric secondline TB therapy while awaiting confirmatory DST results in settings with a high-burden of MDR/XDR-TB.

10.1186_1471_2334_10_344	Blood cultures for the diagnosis of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis among HIV-infected patients from rural South Africa: a cross-sectional study	Background: The yield of mycobacterial blood cultures for multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) among drug-resistant TB suspects has not been described. Methods: We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis to determine the yield of mycobacterial blood cultures for MDR-TB and XDR-TB among patients suspected of drug-resistant TB from rural South Africa. Secondary outcomes included risk factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteremia and the additive yield of mycobacterial blood cultures compared to sputum culture. Results: From 9/1/2006 to 12/31/2008, 130 patients suspected of drug-resistant TB were evaluated with mycobacterial blood culture. Each patient had a single mycobacterial blood culture with 41 (32%) positive for M. tuberculosis, of which 20 (49%) were XDR-TB and 8 (20%) were MDR-TB. One hundred fourteen (88%) patients were known to be HIV-infected. Patients on antiretroviral therapy were significantly less likely to have a positive blood culture for M. tuberculosis (p = 0.002). The diagnosis of MDR or XDR-TB was made by blood culture alone in 12 patients. Conclusions: Mycobacterial blood cultures provided an additive yield for diagnosis of drug-resistant TB in patients with HIV from rural South Africa. The use of mycobacterial blood cultures should be considered in all patients suspected of drug-resistant TB in similar settings.

These compounds were active against drug-sensitive and atypical mycobacterial strains with general MIC values from 0.25 to 16 mu mol/L. The most active compounds were (S)-4-chloro-2-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenylcarbamoyl)phenyl 2-acetamido-3-phenylpropanoate (3i) and (S)-4-bromo-2-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenylcarbamoyl)phenyl 2-acetamido-3-phenylpropanoate (3k) which exhibited activity against MDR and XDR-TB strains with MICs from 1 to 2 mu mol/L. 3k was shown to be less cytotoxic with higher IC(50). Some compounds exhibited low MICs on Gram-positive bacteria (MICs >= 0.98 mu mol/L) and on fungi (MICs >= 3.9 mu mol/L). (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

10.1016_S0929_6646_10_60141_6	Hepatitis Associated With Prothionamide for Treatment of Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis	Timely and intensive monitoring for, and management of, adverse effects caused by anti-tuberculosis drugs are essential components of control programs for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). This retrospective case series was conducted in northern Taiwan from January 2007 to December 2008 at Taipei Medical University-Wan Fang Hospital, a 750-bed tertiary-care center and MDR-TB referral center. Hepatitis associated with prothionamide was defined as the recurrence of hepatitis after a second prothionamide treatment re-challenge. In total, 47 patients with MDR-TB enrolled in the Directly Observed Therapy, Short Course-Plus Program were identified during the study period, and 44 (93.6%) were treated with prothionamide. Seven of these 44 patients (15.9%) developed hepatitis after being treated with prothionamide concurrent with other anti-tuberculosis agents. Hepatitis associated with prothionamide occurred in three of these seven patients (6.8%). In these three patients, hepatitis developed following treatment with prothionamide for 28 days, 39 days or 45 days. Hepatitis developed rapidly after re-challenge with prothionamide at 4 days, 4 days and 3 days, respectively. Liver function returned to the normal range after cessation of prothionamide treatment for 19 days, 27 days or 28 clays. Close monitoring of liver function was necessary in MDR-TB patients who received prothionamide treatment.	hepatitis; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; prothionamide	THERAPY
10.1186_1471_2164_11_670	The non-clonality of drug resistance in Beijing-genotype isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the Western Cape of South Africa	Background: The Beijing genotype of M. tuberculosis is a virulent strain that is disseminating worldwide and has a strong association with drug resistance. In the Western Cape of South Africa, epidemiological studies have identified the R220 cluster of the Beijing genotype as a major contributor to a recent outbreak of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Although the outbreak is considered to be due to clonal transmission, the relationship among drug resistant isolates has not yet been established. Results: To better understand the evolution of drug resistance among these strains, 14 drug-resistant clinical isolates of the Beijing genotype were sequenced by whole-genome sequencing, including eight from R220 and six from a more ancestral Beijing cluster, R86, for comparison. While each cluster shares a distinct resistance mutation for isoniazid, mapping of other drug-resistance mutations onto a phylogenetic tree constructed from single nucleotide polymorphisms shows that resistance mutations to many drugs have arisen multiple times independently within each cluster of isolates. Thus, drug resistance among these isolates appears to be acquired, not clonally derived. This observation suggests that, although the Beijing genotype as a whole might have selective advantages enabling its rapid dissemination, the XDR isolates are relatively less fit and do not propagate well. Although it has been hypothesized that the increased frequency of drug resistance in some Beijing lineages might be caused by a mutator phenotype, no significant shift in synonymous substitution patterns is observed in the genomes. Conclusion: While MDR-TB is spreading by transmission in the Western Cape, our data suggests that further drug resistance (i.e. XDR-TB) at this stage is acquired.

10.1371_journal.pone.0013901	Epidemic Levels of Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR and XDR-TB) in a High HIV Prevalence Setting in Khayelitsha, South Africa	Background: Although multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is emerging as a significant threat to tuberculosis control in high HIV prevalence countries such as South Africa, limited data is available on the burden of drug resistant tuberculosis and any association with HIV in such settings. We conducted a community-based representative survey to assess the MDR-TB burden in Khayelitsha, an urban township in South Africa with high HIV and TB prevalence. Methodology/Principal Findings: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among adult clinic attendees suspected for pulmonary tuberculosis in two large primary care clinics, together constituting 50% of the tuberculosis burden in Khayelitsha. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) for isoniazid and rifampicin was conducted using a line probe assay on positive sputum cultures, and with culture-based DST for first and second-line drugs. Between May and November 2008, culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed in 271 new and 264 previously treated tuberculosis suspects (sample enriched with previously treated cases). Among those with known HIV status, 55% and 71% were HIV infected respectively. MDR-TB was diagnosed in 3.3% and 7.7% of new and previously treated cases. These figures equate to an estimated case notification rate for MDR-TB of 51/100,000/year, with new cases constituting 55% of the estimated MDR-TB burden. HIV infection was not significantly associated with rifampicin resistance in multivariate analyses. Conclusions/Significance: There is an extremely high burden of MDR-TB in this setting, most likely representing ongoing transmission. These data highlight the need to diagnose drug resistance among all TB cases, and for innovative models of case detection and treatment for MDR-TB, in order to interrupt transmission and control this emerging epidemic.

10.1371_journal.pone.0015494	+Mycobacterium tuberculosis Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate Synthetase: Biochemical Features of a Crucial Enzyme for Mycobacterial Cell Wall Biosynthesis	The selection and soaring spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant strains (XDR-TB) is a severe public health problem. Currently, there is an urgent need for new drugs for tuberculosis treatment, with novel mechanisms of action and, moreover, the necessity to identify new drug targets. Mycobacterial phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase (MtbPRPPase) is a crucial enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of decaprenylphosphoryl-arabinose, an essential precursor for the mycobacterial cell wall biosynthesis. Moreover, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate, which is the product of the PRPPase catalyzed reaction, is the precursor for the biosynthesis of nucleotides and of some amino acids such as histidine and tryptophan. In this context, the elucidation of the molecular and functional features of MtbPRPPase is mandatory. MtbPRPPase was obtained as a recombinant form, purified to homogeneity and characterized. According to its hexameric form, substrate specificity and requirement of phosphate for activity, the enzyme proved to belong to the class I of PRPPases. Although the sulfate mimicked the phosphate, it was less effective and required higher concentrations for the enzyme activation. MtbPRPPase showed hyperbolic response to ribose 5-phosphate, but sigmoidal behaviour towards Mg-ATP. The enzyme resulted to be allosterically activated by Mg(2+) or Mn(2+) and inhibited by Ca(2+) and Cu(2+) but, differently from other characterized PRPPases, it showed a better affinity for the Mn(2+) and Cu(2+) ions, indicating a different cation binding site geometry. Moreover, the enzyme from M. tuberculosis was allosterically inhibited by ADP, but less sensitive to inhibition by GDP. The characterization of M. tuberculosis PRPPase provides the starting point for the development of inhibitors for antitubercular drug design.

pub-1429	Anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in new and previously treated pulmonary tuberculosis cases in Burkina Faso	SETTING: National Tuberculosis (TB) Control Centre in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance among newly diagnosed and previously treated cases. METHODS: A total of 416 M. tuberculosis complex strains were isolated from 323 new and 93 previously treated patients under DOTS. Susceptibility to four anti-tuberculosis drugs (isoniazid [INH], rifampicin [RMP] streptomycin [SM] and ethambutol [EMB]) was determined using the proportion method. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status was determined in 316 patients, 249 new and 67 previously treated cases, with informed consent. RESULTS: Among new cases, 12.4% of strains were resistant to any drug, and 3.4% were multidrug-resistant (MDR). Resistance rates were very high in previously treated patients: INH (66.7%), RMP (51.6%), SM (44.1%), EMB (50.5%) and MDR (INH+RMP; 50.5%). Of 316 patients tested, 28.7% were HIV-positive. There was no statistically significant association between HIV status and MDR-TB in new (P = 0.95) and previously treated patients (P = 0.5). CONCLUSION: Drug resistance is high in Burkina Faso. Early detection of infectious patients and completion of treatment are essential.	Mycobacterium tuberculosis; resistance; tuberculosis; Burkina Faso	EPIDEMIOLOGY
pub-1430	Latent tuberculosis infection among close contacts of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients in central Taiwan	SETTING: Both the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the QuantiFERON (R)-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-GIT) may be used to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. A positive reaction to either test can indicate latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). These tests can be used to study the rate of infection in contacts of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the transmission status of MDR-TB patients in Taiwan by examining their close contacts and to compare the efficiency of TST and QFT-GIT. DESIGN: Chest radiographs, TST and QFT-GIT were performed in household contacts of confirmed MDR-TB patients to determine their infection status. RESULTS: A total of 78 close contacts of confirmed MDR-TB patients were included in the study. The majority of the MDR-TB patients were parents of the close contacts and lived in the same building; 46% of the subjects were TST-positive and 19% were QFT-GIT-positive, indicating LTBI that was likely to develop into active MDR-TB. There was a lack of consistency between TST and QFT-GIT results in subjects with previous bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination. CONCLUSION: Household contacts of MDR-TB patients arc likely to develop LTBI; thus, follow-up and monitoring are mandatory to provide treatment and reduce the occurrence of active infection.	latent tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; QuantiFERON (R)-TB Gold In-Tube; tuberculin skin test	GAMMA-INTERFERON PRODUCTION; SKIN-TEST; PERFORMANCE; DIAGNOSIS; ANTIGENS; CATTLE; ESAT-6; ASSAY
pub-1431	Concomitant increases in spectrum and level of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates	OBJECTIVE: To determine the drug resistance spectrum and resistance levels of extensively drug-resistant (XDR-) and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and TB resistant to either rifampicin (RMP, R) or isoniazid (INH, H; R/H-DR). DESIGN: Of 142 drug-resistant clinical isolates examined, 13 were XDR-TB, 66 were MDR-TB and 63 were R/H-DR. The drug resistance spectrum was tested by the absolute two-concentration method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for the strains by agar dilution method on Lowenstein-Jensen slants. RESULTS: The drug resistance spectrum of XDR-TB, MDR-TB and R/H-DR TB isolates ranged from 4 to 9, 2 to 6 and 1 to 5 drugs, respectively. Over half of all XDR-TB (53.8%), MDR-TB (66.7%) and R/H-DR (54.0%) isolates were resistant to two other anti-tuberculosis drugs; 38.5% of XDR-TB, 24.2% of MDR-TB and 28.6% of R/H-DR TB isolates were resistant to >= 3 additional anti-tuberculosis drugs in addition to those originally defined, demonstrating that the MIC values and the proportions of strains with higher MICs followed a trend of XDR-TB > MDR-TB > R/H-DR for INH, RMP, ofloxacin and ethambutol. CONCLUSION: XDR-TB, MDR-TB and R/H-DR TB isolates exhibited both increasingly broader resistance spectra and a higher percentage of strains with high MICs to more frequently resistant drugs, which might be related to patterns of TB chemotherapy.

pub-1432	MODS accreditation process for regional reference laboratories in Peru: validation by GenoType (R) MTBDRplus	SETTING: Although considerable effort has been put into the development and evaluation of new diagnostics for tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), little attention has thus far been paid to the technical aspects of initiating quality-assured routine service use. For implementation of the microscopic-observation drug susceptibility (MODS) methodology in the Peruvian reference laboratory network, a laboratory accreditation process was devised; MODS results from an expert reference laboratory (Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia [UPCH]) were used as the standard against which implementing laboratory MODS results were judged to ensure that, prior to use for patient care, implementing laboratories achieved the same high performance with MODS as previously demonstrated in the research laboratory. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity of MODS-based accreditation and the concordance of MODS drug susceptibility testing (DST) with molecular testing. DESIGN: Head-to-head comparison of MODS DST results from implementing Peruvian regional reference laboratories and the accrediting expert MODS laboratory (UPCH) with GenoType (R) MTBDRplus DST. RESULTS: The concordance of phenotypic MODS rifampicin (RMP) DST with GenoType MTBDRplus was respectively 97.4%, 97.9% and 97.1% for the two implementing regional laboratories and UPCH, and respectively 94.7%, 95.7% and 94.6% for isoniazid (INH) DST. CONCLUSION: High and consistent levels of MODS/MTBDRplus concordance for INH and RMP DST confirm the validity of the use of rapid methods as reference standards for accreditation.	tuberculosis; MODS; MTBDRplus; laboratory accreditation	DRUG-SUSCEPTIBILITY ASSAY; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MICROSCOPIC-OBSERVATION; MDR-TB; DIAGNOSIS; RIFAMPIN
10.1128_JCM.00572_10	Spoligotype-Based Comparative Population Structure Analysis of Multidrug-Resistant and Isoniazid-Monoresistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex Clinical Isolates in Poland	The spoligotyping-based population structure of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated in Poland (n = 46), representing all culture-positive MDR tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases, was compared to that of isoniazid (INH)-monoresistant strains (n = 71) isolated in 2004. The latter data set from a previous study (E. Augustynowicz-Kopec, T. Jagielski, and Z. Zwolska, J. Clin. Microbiol. 2008, 46: 40414044) represented 87% of all INH-monoresistant strains. The clustering rates and genotypic-diversity indexes for the 2 subpopulations were not significantly different (P = 0.05). The results were entered in the SITVIT2 database to assign specific shared type designations, corresponding genotypic lineages, and geographical distributions and compared to available data from neighboring countries (Germany, n = 704; Czech Republic, n = 530; Sweden, n = 379; Kaliningrad, Russia, n = 90) and strains from previous studies in Poland (n = 317). MDR strains resulted in 27 patterns (20 unique strains within the study and 7 clusters containing 2 to 6 isolates per cluster with a clustering rate of 56.5%) and belonged to the following genotypic lineages: ill-defined T family (28.3%), Haarlem (17.4%), Latin American and Mediterranean (LAM) (13%), Beijing (8.7%), S family (4.35%), and the X clade (2.17%). Comparison of the genetic structure of the MDR strains with that of INH-monoresistant strains showed that a total of 9 patterns were shared by both groups; these represented 1/3 of the MDR strains and 2/3 of the INH-monoresistant strains. Interestingly, 76.1% of the MDR isolates and 71.8% of the INH-resistant isolates yielded spoligotypes that were previously reported from Poland. The observation that nearly half of the spoligotypes identified among both MDR (48.1%) and INH-monoresistant (43.3%) M. tuberculosis isolates were present in Poland's neighboring countries suggested that a significant proportion of MDR and INH-resistant TB cases in Poland were caused by strains actively circulating in Poland or its neighbors. Our results corroborate the leading role of the T and Haarlem genotypes in the epidemiology of drug-resistant TB in Poland. Nevertheless, the LAM and Beijing family strains that infected, correspondingly, 13% and 9% of patients with MDR-TB were absent among the strains from patients with INH-monoresistant TB, suggesting that a proportion of MDR-TB cases in Poland are due to ongoing transmission of MDR clones exhibiting specific genotypes. Study of the population genetic relationships between MDR and INH-monoresistant strains by drawing minimum spanning trees showed that ill-defined T1 sublineage strains (1/3 of all INH-monoresistant strains), represented by its prototype, SIT53, constituted the central node of the tree, followed by strains belonging to the well-defined H3, H1, and S subgroups. However, the MDR group, in addition, contained LAM (n = 6) and Beijing (n = 4) lineage isolates. With the exception of the 4 Beijing lineage strains in the latter group and a single orphan isolate in the INH-monoresistant group, none of the remaining 112/117 isolates belonged to principal genetic group 1 (PGG1) in our study. Given the high rate of clustering and the near absence of immigrants in the study, the persistence of MDR-TB in Poland seems to result from active transmission of MDR strains within the autochthonous population, the bulk of it caused by evolutionarily recent tubercle bacilli.

pub-1434	Direct drug susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis against primary anti-TB drugs in northern India	Introduction: The present study aimed to evaluate a rapid and inexpensive colorimetric nitrate reductase assay (NRA) performed directly on sputum specimens for detection of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Methodology: A total of 55 sputum samples were decontaminated and processed by modified Petroff's method. A part of the resulting suspension was used to perform direct NRA (DNRA) and direct proportion method (DPM) analysis. Of the 55 samples, 45 could be used to compare the two methods. Indirect drug sensitivity testing (DST) was also done for 14 MTB strains. Results: Excellent agreement was found between DNRA and DPM testing with. values of 1, 0.91, 0.91, and 1 for RIF, INH, STR and EMB respectively. The sensitivities and specificities of DNRA compared to that of DPM were observed to be 100 and 100%, 100 and 93%, 95 and 96%, 100 and 100% for RIF, INH, STR, and EMB respectively. Comparing the results of DNRA, DPM and indirect NRA with those of the gold standard indirect PM for 14 MTB strains showed that sensitivities, specificities and percent agreements were 100, 100 and 100% for all four tested drugs. Results for most of the specimens (55.6%) were available in 21 days with DNRA. Conclusions: We have saved valuable time by omitting the pre-isolation step and conclude that DNRA is a rapid, accurate and inexpensive method for direct DST of MTB and may become an appropriate alternative method for the resource limited settings.

10.1542_peds.2009_2172	Two Pediatric Cases of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Treated With Linezolid and Moxifloxacin	We report here 2 pediatric cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) that were observed in Italy. Both families came from an Eastern European country, which is notably an area with a high prevalence of MDR TB. An increase of new cases of MDR TB in developed countries is expected over the next years because of migratory flow, and specific measures and strategies need to be taken to prevent the propagation and dissemination of MDR TB. An efficacious treatment including linezolid and moxifloxacin was administered for 13 months in 1 case. No adverse reactions were detected during close child monitoring. Linezolid and newer fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin have been reported to be effective for MDR-TB treatment in adults. On the contrary, there is limited available evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in infants and children with MDR TB. The use of second-line drugs not approved for use in children may be necessary to treat a life-threatening disease such as MDR TB, but it requires careful monitoring to quickly recognize the occurrence of dose-and duration-dependent adverse drug reactions.

However, little is known about the rates of drug-resistant tuberculosis among health care workers in countries with high tuberculosis and HIV burden. Objective: To estimate rates of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and XDR-TB hospitalizations among health care workers in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Design: Retrospective study of patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis who were admitted from 2003 to 2008 for the initiation of drug-resistant tuberculosis therapy. Setting: A public tuberculosis referral hospital in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Participants: 231 health care workers and 4151 non-health care workers admitted for initiation of MDR-TB or XDR-TB treatment. Measurements: Hospital admission rates and hospital admission incidence rate ratios. Results: Estimated incidence of MDR-TB hospitalization was 64.8 per 100 000 health care workers versus 11.9 per 100 000 non-health care workers (incidence rate ratio, 5.46 [95% CI, 4.75 to 6.28]). Estimated incidence of XDR-TB hospitalizations was 7.2 per 100 000 health care workers versus 1.1 per 100 000 non-health care workers (incidence rate ratio, 6.69 [CI, 4.38 to 10.20]). A higher percentage of health care workers than non-health care workers with MDR-TB or XDR-TB were women (78% vs. 47%; P < 0.001), and health care workers were less likely to report previous tuberculosis treatment (41% vs. 92%; P < 0.001). HIV infection did not differ between health care workers and nonhealth care workers (55% vs. 57%); however, among HIV-infected patients, a higher percentage of health care workers were receiving antiretroviral medications (63% vs. 47%; P < 0.001). Limitation: The study had an observational retrospective design, is subject to referral bias, and had no information on type of health care work or duration of occupational exposure to tuberculosis. Conclusion: Health care workers in this HIV-endemic area were substantially more likely to be hospitalized with either MDR-TB or XDR-TB than were non-health care workers. The increased risk may be explained by occupational exposure, underlining the urgent need for tuberculosis infection-control programs.

10.1016_j.ejmech.2010.07.020	Schiff bases of indoline-2,3-dione (isatin) derivatives and nalidixic acid carbohydrazide, synthesis, antitubercular activity and pharmacophoric model building	Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the world's great public health challenges. Worldwide resurgence of TB is due to two major problems. the AIDS epidemic, which started in the mid-1980s, and the outbreak of multidrug resistant (MDR) TB. Thus, there is an urgent need for anti-TB drugs with enhanced activity against MDR strains. In recent years, Schiff bases of 1H-indole-2,3-diones are reported to exhibit anti-TB activity On the other hand, several quinolone antibacterial agents have been examined as inhibitors of TB. as well as other mycobacterial infections. Accordingly, the current work involved design and synthesis of Schiff bases of nalidixic acid carbohydrazide and Isatin derivatives (5,6a-f and 7,8a-c). Structures of the synthesized derivatives were confirmed on the bases of spectral methods of analyses. Anti-TB activity of the synthesized derivatives was investigated against four Mycobacterium strains. Mycobacterium intercellulari, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium cheleneo and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Modest anti-TB activity was observed within the investigated compounds, however, compound 5f revealed potent anti-TB activity with MIC 0.625 mu g/ml, which is 20 times greater than the reference drug isoniazid, INH, (MIC = 12.5 mu g/ml). A hypothetical pharmacophore model was built using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) program and 10 compounds structurally related to the synthesized ones with reported anti-TB activity. The Pharmacophonc model built revealed the necessity of the following pharmacophoric features for anti-TB activity: aromatic center, hydrogen bond acceptor/metal ligator center, hydrogen bond donor center and aromatic center/hydrophobic area. Theses features were consistent with the found anti-TB activity of the tested compounds. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

10.1016_j.meegid.2010.06.018	A high prevalence of resistance in new tuberculosis cases of midwestern Brazil	Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious worldwide public health problem, and drug resistance, particularly multidrug resistance (MDR), is a critical factor involved in TB control. We analyzed Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from 132 new TB cases of treatment-naive patients in Goias, Brazil by drug susceptibility tests, partial sequencing of the rpoB and katG genes, inhA(C-15T) mutation analysis by PCR, and RFLP-IS6110 genotyping. A high frequency of drug resistance was observed in previously untreated patients (13.6% to at least one antibiotic and 6.1% MDR-TB), and a high rate DNA polymorphism was detected in these strains. These results suggest that the prevalence of resistant TB is underestimated and that resistance in new TB cases was not associated with an outbreak in this region. We recommend routine culture and susceptibility testing for all new TB cases in Goias for the appropriate treatment and control of this disease. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

10.1510_icvts.2010.236372	Different morbidity after pneumonectomy: multidrug-resistant tuberculosis versus non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection	To assess whether there is any difference in postoperative morbidity and mortality after pneumonectomy between patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections. Between January 2000 and December 2007, 61 patients with MDR-TB and 60 patients with NTM infections underwent 66 and 64 pulmonary resections, respectively. Of these, 33 patients were analyzed who underwent a pneumonectomy, including 22 patients with MDR-TB (seven right, 15 left) and 11 patients with NTM infections (seven right, four left). All bronchial stumps were covered with the latissimus dorsi. Patients with NTM infections were predominantly more female, older, thinner, and presented with a higher frequency of culture-positive sputum at operation than patients with MDR-TB. Operative mortality was zero. Morbidities were bronchial stump dehiscence (n=1) and mycobacterial empyema (n=1) for patients with MDR-TB, and acute respiratory failure (n=1), bronchial stump dehiscence (n=5) and mycobacterial empyema (n=2) for patients with NTM infections. Prevalence of bronchial stump dehiscence was significantly higher in patients with NTM infections (P=0.010). Five of six dehiscences occurred after right pneumonectomy. The optimal management of the bronchial stump in the setting of pneumonectomy for NTM infections needs further investigation. (C) 2010 Published by European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.

pub-1440	Turning off the spigot: reducing drug-resistant tuberculosis transmission in resource-limited settings	Ongoing transmission and re-infection, primarily in congregate settings, is a key factor fueling the global multidrug-resistant/extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/XDR-TB) epidemic, especially in association with the human immunodeficiency virus. Even as efforts to broadly implement conventional TB transmission control measures begin, current strategies may be incompletely effective under the overcrowded conditions extant in high-burden, resource-limited settings. Longstanding evidence suggesting that TB patients on effective therapy rapidly become non-infectious and that unsuspected, untreated TB cases account for the most transmission makes a strong case for the implementation of rapid point-of-care diagnostics coupled with fully supervised effective treatment. Among the most important decisions affecting transmission, the choice of an MDR-TB treatment model that includes community-based treatment may offer important advantages over hospital or clinic-based care, not only in cost and effectiveness, but also in transmission control. In the community, too, rapid identification of infectious cases, especially drug-resistant cases, followed by effective, fully supervised treatment, is critical to stopping transmission. Among the conventional interventions available, we present a simple triage and separation strategy, point out that separation is intimately linked to the design and engineering of clinical space and call attention to the pros and cons of natural ventilation, simple mechanical ventilation systems, germicidal ultraviolet air disinfection, fit-tested respirators on health care workers and short-term use of masks on patients before treatment is initiated.	nosocomial; resistance; drug; tuberculosis	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; AIR DISINFECTION; ULTRAVIOLET-IRRADIATION; RURAL HAITI; MDR-TB; COMMUNITY; HIV; PERU; LIMA; CHEMOTHERAPY
pub-1441	Phenotypic and genotypic analysis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Ethiopia	SETTING: National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. OBJECTIVES: To determine the drug susceptibility pattern of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates and to genetically characterise multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates. DESIGN: A total of 107 M. tuberculosis isolates recovered during the period December 2005 August 2006 were tested for drug susceptibility against streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol (SHRE) using the proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. The MDR-TB isolates were tested against kanamycin, ciprofloxacin, capreomycin, D-cycloserine and ethionamide. Genotyping was performed using spoligotyping. RESULTS: MDR-TB was observed in one of the 44 new cases (2.3%) and 45/63 previously treated patients (71.4%). Drug susceptibility testing against second-line drugs (SLDs) showed that 26.1% of all MDR-TB isolates were susceptible to all SLDs tested and 73.9% were resistant to one or more classes of SLD. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB was detected in two isolates (4.4%). T3_ETH was the predominant spoligotype, followed by CAS_KILL In this African setting, no Beijing spoligotype was identified. CONCLUSION: Both MDR- and XDR-TB are present in Ethiopian patients. MDR-TB was found to be associated with T3 and Central Asian genotypes.	tuberculosis; Ethiopia; multidrug resistance; spoligotyping; second-line treatment	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; DRUG-RESISTANCE; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; TRENDS
pub-1442	Patient and family costs associated with tuberculosis, including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, in Ecuador	BACKGROUND: There is little published information on the costs of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) for patients and their families in low- or middle-income countries. METHODS: Between February and July 2007, patients with microbiologically confirmed active TB who had received 2 months of treatment completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire on direct out-of-pocket expenditures and indirect costs from lost wages. Clinical data were abstracted from their medical records. RESULTS: Among 104 non-MDR-TB patients, total TB-related patient costs averaged US$960 per patient, compared to an average total cost of US$6880 for 14 participating MDR-TB patients. This represents respectively 31% and 223% of the average Ecuadorian annual income. The high costs associated with MDR-TB were mainly due to the long duration of illness, which averaged 22 months up to the time of the interview. This resulted in very long periods of unemployment. Most patients experienced a significant drop in income, particularly the MDR-TB patients, all of whom were earning less than US$100/month at the time of the interview. CONCLUSION: Direct and indirect costs borne by patients with active TB and their families are very high in Ecuador, and are highest for patients with MDR-TB. These costs are important barriers to treatment completion.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; MDR-TB; economic impact; patients' costs	COUNTRIES; PROGRAMS; OUTCOMES; IMPACT; CARE

Forty seven out of 65 (72%) TB patients had severe/moderate level of anxiety and depression according to Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Fourteen (22%) TB patients with co-morbid anxiety and depression showed multi drug-resistance (MDR-TB).	Tuberculosis; Anxiety; Depression; Psychiatric co-morbidity; MDR-TB	
10.1128_JCM.00715_10	Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing Lineage Favors the Spread of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in the Republic of Georgia	"High rates and transmission of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) have been associated with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) Beijing lineage, pointing to the importance of pathogen genetic factors for the modulation of infection outcome and epidemiology. We present here an in-depth analysis of the population structure of MTBC strains from the Republic of Georgia, a high-incidence setting at the Black Sea Coast. Phylogenetic lineages were identified based on 24-locus MIRU-VNTR (for mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat) and spoligotyping analysis. Clusters of strains with identical genotyping profiles were determined as an indicator for the rate of recent transmission. Among the 183 M. tuberculosis isolates investigated, the most prominent lineage found was Beijing (26%), followed by the LAM (18%), Ural (12%), and Haarlem (5%) strains. A closely related previously undefined phylogenetic group (62 strains) showed a genotyping pattern similar to laboratory strain H37RV and was denominated as ""Georgia-H37RV-like."" Although isoniazid resistance was found among strains of different lineages, MDR TB was nearly completely restricted to Beijing strains (P < 0.0001). Approximately 50% of the isolates were grouped in clusters, indicating a high rate of recent transmission. Our data indicate that, in addition to the confirmation of the importance of Beijing genotype strains for the TB epidemiology in former Soviet Union countries, a high-population diversity with strains of the LAM, Ural, Haarlem, and a previously undefined lineage represents nearly two-thirds of the strains found in Georgia. Higher rates among previously treated and MDR TB patients point to a higher potential of lineage Beijing to escape therapy and develop MDR TB."

10.1371_journal.pone.0012843	Heightened Vulnerability to MDR-TB Epidemics after Controlling Drug-Susceptible TB	Background: Prior infection with one strain TB has been linked with diminished likelihood of re-infection by a new strain. This paper attempts to determine the role of declining prevalence of drug-susceptible TB in enabling future epidemics of MDR-TB. Methods: A computer simulation of MDR-TB epidemics was developed using an agent-based model platform programmed in NetLogo (See http://mdr.tbtools.org/). Eighty-one scenarios were created, varying levels of treatment quality, diagnostic accuracy, microbial fitness cost, and the degree of immunogenicity elicited by drug-susceptible TB. Outcome measures were the number of independent MDR-TB cases per trial and the proportion of trials resulting in MDR-TB epidemics for a 500 year period after drug therapy for TB is introduced. Results: MDR-TB epidemics propagated more extensively after TB prevalence had fallen. At a case detection rate of 75%, improving therapeutic compliance from 50% to 75% can reduce the probability of an epidemic from 45% to 15%. Paradoxically, improving the case-detection rate from 50% to 75% when compliance with DOT is constant at 75% increases the probability of MDR-TB epidemics from 3% to 45%. Conclusions: The ability of MDR-TB to spread depends on the prevalence of drug-susceptible TB. Immunologic protection conferred by exposure to drug-susceptible TB can be a crucial factor that prevents MDR-TB epidemics when TB treatment is poor. Any single population that successfully reduces its burden of drug-susceptible TB will have reduced herd immunity to externally or internally introduced strains of MDR-TB and can experience heightened vulnerability to an epidemic. Since countries with good TB control may be more vulnerable, their self interest dictates greater promotion of case detection and DOTS implementation in countries with poor control to control their risk of MDR-TB.

10.1056_NEJMoa0907847	Rapid Molecular Detection of Tuberculosis and Rifampin Resistance	BACKGROUND Global control of tuberculosis is hampered by slow, insensitive diagnostic methods, particularly for the detection of drug-resistant forms and in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Early detection is essential to reduce the death rate and interrupt transmission, but the complexity and infrastructure needs of sensitive methods limit their accessibility and effect. METHODS We assessed the performance of Xpert MTB/RIF, an automated molecular test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and resistance to rifampin (RIF), with fully integrated sample processing in 1730 patients with suspected drug-sensitive or multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. Eligible patients in Peru, Azerbaijan, South Africa, and India provided three sputum specimens each. Two specimens were processed with N-acetyl-l-cysteine and sodium hydroxide before microscopy, solid and liquid culture, and the MTB/RIF test, and one specimen was used for direct testing with microscopy and the MTB/RIF test. RESULTS Among culture-positive patients, a single, direct MTB/RIF test identified 551 of 561 patients with smear-positive tuberculosis (98.2%) and 124 of 171 with smear-negative tuberculosis (72.5%). The test was specific in 604 of 609 patients without tuberculosis (99.2%). Among patients with smear-negative, culture-positive tuberculosis, the addition of a second MTB/RIF test increased sensitivity by 12.6 percentage points and a third by 5.1 percentage points, to a total of 90.2%. As compared with phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing, MTB/RIF testing correctly identified 200 of 205 patients (97.6%) with rifampin-resistant bacteria and 504 of 514 (98.1%) with rifampin-sensitive bacteria. Sequencing resolved all but two cases in favor of the MTB/RIF assay. CONCLUSIONS The MTB/RIF test provided sensitive detection of tuberculosis and rifampin resistance directly from untreated sputum in less than 2 hours with minimal hands-on time.

10.7705_biomedica.v30i3.270	Drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in children under 15 years	Introduction. Tuberculosis is a widespread and increasingly important infectious disease. A third of the world-wide population is infected. Every year nine million cases occur in the world, one million of them appearing in children under 15 years old. In Colombia alone, 719 cases were reported for the year 2008. Objective. The incidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant forms was characterized in children under 15 years old in Colombia. Materials and methods. Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug susceptibility test data from 2001 to mid year 2009 were analyzed at the Laboratorio Nacional de Referencia, Instituto Nacional de Salud, Bogota, Colombia. Cases were evaluated by patient age, disease geographic location, and type of sample, as well as the proportions of TB/HIV coinfections and drug resistance. Results. Of the 128 patients examined, 66 were female (52%) and 62 were male (48%). The age group 0 to 5 years old consisted of 59 cases (46%), 21 cases were 6 to 10 years old (16%) and 48 cases 11 to 14 years old (37.5%). The types of disease were 89 (69.6%) pulmonary, 34 (26.4%) extrapulmonary, and 5 (3.9%) cases without data. TB/VIH coinfection cases were 7(5.4%). 123 (96%) untreated cases and 5 (2.34%) cases previously treated. Global resistance among the untreated cases was 21.1% and MDR-TB was 6.5%. Conclusion. This analysis demonstrated weaknesses in following established procedures in the TB treatment process, thereby impeding the diagnosis and the identification of drug resistance s in children under 15 years old. Approaches to improving treatment standards is a topic which requires further exploration.

10.3201_eid1609.100253	Determinants of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Clusters, California, USA, 2004-2007	Laboratory and epidemiologic evidence suggests that pathogen-specific factors may affect multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) transmission and pathogenesis. To identify demographic and clinical characteristics of MDR TB case clustering and to estimate the effect of specific isoniazid resistance conferring mutations and strain lineage on genotypic clustering, we conducted a population-based cohort study of all MDR TB cases reported in California from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2007. Of 8,899 incident culture-positive cases for which drug susceptibility information was available, 141 (2%) were MDR. Of 123 (87%) strains with genotype data, 25 (20%) were aggregated in 8 clusters; 113 (92%) of all MDR TB cases and 21 (84%) of clustered MDR TB cases occurred among foreign-born patients. In multivariate analysis, the katG S315T mutation (odds ratio 11.2, 95% confidence interval 2.2-infinity; p = 0.004), but not strain lineage, was independently associated with case clustering.

10.1007_s00217_010_1328_1	Effect of black tea (Camellia sinensis) on virulence traits of clinical isolates of Shigella dysenteriae and Escherichia coli EPEC P-2 1265 strain	The crude tea polyphenols of regular black tea were investigated in vitro for effect on virulence traits of Shigella dysenteriae and Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC P-2 1265) strains. Results showed that crude tea polyphenols of black tea significantly increased (p < 0.05) phagocytic uptake of tea-adapted S. dysenteriae cells in 30 min by 37.68% and phagocytic killing by ten-folds in 3 h. Further, acid tolerance response in EPEC P-2 1265 strain was also decreased in tea-adapted culture in order: Acid adapted, tea un-adapted > acid un-adapted, tea un-adapted > acid adapted, tea adapted > acid un-adapted, tea-adapted. These results inferred that polyphenolic treatment of bacterial culture disrupts pH hemostasis which caused complete bacterial killing in 120 min when compared to tea-untreated culture where complete killing required 180 min. Serum bactericidal activity was also increased in tea-treated culture of EPEC P-2 1265 when 2-h serum treatment caused complete bacterial killing but un-treated cells were killed after 3 h. Also, significant increase (p < 0.05) in enterochelin production was observed when EPEC P-2 1265 was grown in presence of tea. The present findings indicate that boiling water black tea extract reduces expression of virulence traits by S. dysenteriae and E. coli EPEC P-2 1265 enteropathogen as shown by decreased bacterial survival strategies. The results promote the use of tea extract against multidrug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosae (MDR-TB) strains and other enteropathogens.

10.1183_09031936.00003710	Treatment outcome of multidrug/extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in Latvia, 2000-2004	In the present study, we characterised drug-resistance patterns, compared treatment outcome between extensively and nonextensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (non-XDR-TB) cases, and assessed risk factors for poor outcome in a high-prevalence country that screens all TB patients for first-line anti-TB drug resistance. We reviewed drug susceptibility test results among all pulmonary TB cases in Latvia diagnosed from 2000-2004, as well as demographic and clinical characteristics, drug-resistance patterns, and treatment outcomes. During the 5-yr period, 1,027 multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases initiated treatment. Among all cases, the proportion that experienced an outcome of cure or completion increased from 66.2 to 70.2% (p=0.06 for linear trend). Among the 48 (4.7%) XDR-TB cases, 18 (38%) were cured, four (8%) died, three (6%) defaulted, and treatment failed in 23 (48%). In proportional-hazards analysis, characteristics significantly associated with poor outcome included XDR-TB, being retired, presence of bilateral cavitation, and previous MDR-TB treatment history for those aged >= 55 yrs. Overall, treatment success among all MDR-TB cases increased over time. Strategies to prevent transmission of XDR-TB and to further improve treatment outcome are crucial for the future of TB control in Latvia.

10.1016_j.idc.2010.05.001	Extensively Drug-resistant Tuberculosis: Epidemiology and Management Challenges	Widespread global use of rifampin for 2 decades preceded the emergence of clinically significant multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the early 1990s. The prevalence of MDR-TB has gradually increased such that it accounts for similar to 5% of the global case burden of disease (approximately half a million cases in 2007). Eclipsing this worrying trend is the widespread emergence of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). This article reviews the insights provided by clinical and molecular epidemiology regarding global trends and transmission dynamics of XDR-TB, and the challenges clinicians have to face in diagnosing and managing cases of XDR-TB. The ethical and management dilemmas posed by recurrent defaulters, XDR-TB treatment failures, and isolation of incurable patients are also discussed. Given the past global trends in MDR-TB, if aggressive preventive and management strategies are not implemented, XDR-TB has the potential to severely cripple global control efforts of TB.

10.1016_j.ijid.2010.04.005	Decrease in CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T-reg cells after pulmonary resection in the treatment of cavity multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Objectives: Immune regulatory mechanisms may limit the immunopathologic condition of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and suppress cellular immune responses in the host. We investigated the CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) circulating regulatory T cells (T-reg) in patients with cavity multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) before and after surgery. Methods: We compared the proportion of T-reg cells in 13 patients with cavity MDR-TB pre- and postoperatively and in 10 healthy control subjects by flow cytometry using three specific markers in peripheral blood lymphocytes: cell-surface CD4 and CD25 expression and intracellular FoxP3 expression. Results: The proportion of CD4(+)CD25(high) and CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T-reg was significantly higher in patients with cavity MDR-TB and at 1-month postoperatively than in healthy controls (p < 0.001). The proportion of CD4(+) and CD4(+)CD25 cells was significantly lower in patients with cavity MDR-TB than in controls (p < 0.001). Pre- and postoperative proportions of CD4(+)CD25(high) and CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T-reg cells showed a positive correlation (r = 0.878, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Circulating Treg cells are increased in proportion in patients with cavity MDR-TB and decreased after surgery. Infection with M. tuberculosis may induce T-reg cell-surface molecular changes with increased numbers of cells. (C) 2010 International Society for Infectious Diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

pub-1455	Surveillance for MDR-TB: is there an obligation to ensure treatment for individuals identified with MDR-TB?	This article raises ethical issues that result if individuals, during the course of research to measure the prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis, are identified with the disease but are not provided with or referred for appropriate treatment. It draws attention to and applauds recently published World Health Organization guidelines on the subject. Questions posed are: 1) Should treatment be provided for individuals identified through surveillance projects for MDR-TB, whatever their purpose (specific research or 'routine' national prevalence studies)? 2) If treatment availability is a problem, who is responsible for assuring this?

pub-1456	Prevalence of Multidrug and Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Beijing, China: a Hospital-Based Retrospective Study	Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease of worldwide public-health concern. The development of resistance to an increasing number of second-line drugs and those used to treat multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB is rapidly becoming an emergency that could hinder the prevention and treatment of TB globally. This study describes the resistance profile of MDR and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB with a hospital-based survey in Beijing, China, conducted in the period 2007 to 2009. Drug-susceptibility tests performed on 967 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated from 967 patients showed that the rate of resistance to at least one first-line and at least one second-line drug was 70.1% and 60.7%, respectively. The overall MDR rate was 19.4%, and 14.9% of the MDR cases were XDR. In conclusion, MDR and XDR TB represent a significant number of total TB cases, therefore effective measures to manage these resistant strains are desperately needed. Development of a national TB policy in China might be a key method for solving the present problems of TB management.		MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; IMPLEMENTATION; SHANGHAI

Methods: A case was defined as either culture-confirmed MDR TB with a drug-susceptibility pattern closely resembling that of the index case, or a clinical diagnosis of active TB disease and corroborated contact with a person with culture-confirmed MDR TB. Medical records were reviewed, and patients and their contacts were interviewed. Results: Five secondary TB cases were associated with the index case. Of 369 contacts of the index case, 189 (51%) were evaluated. Of those, 97 (51%) had positive tuberculin skin test (TST) results, 79 (81%) began therapy for latent TB infection (LTBI), and 38 (48%) completed LTBI therapy. Conclusion: Despite consistent follow up by public health officials, a low proportion of patients diagnosed with LTBI completed therapy. Clinicians and public health practitioners who serve immigrant communities should be vigilant for MDR TB.	disease outbreaks; epidemiology; immigrants; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	
10.1111_j.1365_3156.2010.02581.x	Review of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB: global perspectives with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa	Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global emergency and is responsible for 1.7 million deaths annually. Widespread global misuse of isoniazid and rifampicin over three decades has resulted in emergence of the ominous spread of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) globally. These difficult to treat resistant forms of TB are increasingly seen in Asia, Eastern Europe, South America and sub-Saharan Africa, disrupting TB and HIV control programmes. We review the latest available global epidemiological and clinical evidence on drug-resistant TB in HIV-infected and uninfected populations, with focus on Africa where data are scanty because of poor diagnostic and reporting facilities. The difficult management and infection control problems posed by drug-resistant TB in HIV-infected patients are discussed. Given the increasing current global trends in MDR-TB, aggressive preventive and management strategies are urgently required to avoid disruption of global TB control efforts. The data suggest that existing interventions, public health systems and TB and HIV programmes must be strengthened significantly. Political and funder commitment is essential to curb the spread of drug-resistant TB.	tuberculosis; drugs; MDR-TB; XDR-TB; epidemiology; microbiology; treatment	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS RESISTANT; STANDARD RETREATMENT REGIMEN; HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; XDR-TB; SOUTH-AFRICA; MDR-TB; RIFAMPIN; EPIDEMIOLOGY
10.1186_1471_2180_10_223	Surveillance of pyrazinamide susceptibility among multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Siriraj Hospital, Thailand	Background: Susceptibility testing of pyrazinamide (PZA) against Mycobacterium tuberculosis is difficult to perform because the acidity of culture medium that is required for drug activity also inhibits the growth of bacteria. In Thailand, very limited information has been generated on PZA resistance, particularly among multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolated from Thailand. Only two studies on PZA susceptibility among Thai M. tuberculosis strains have been reported; one used a pyrazinamidase assay, and the other used the BACTEC 460 TB for PZA susceptibility testing. In this study, we determined the percentage of strains possessing pyrazinamide resistance among pan-susceptible M. tuberculosis and MDR-TB isolates by using the pyrazinamidase assay, BACTEC MGIT 960 PZA method and pncA sequencing, and assessed the correlation in the data generated using these methods. The type and frequency of mutations in pncA were also determined. Results: Overall, 150 M. tuberculosis isolates, consisting of 50 susceptible and 100 MDR-TB isolates, were tested for PZA susceptibility by BACTEC MGIT 960 PZA, the pyrazinamidase assay and pncA sequencing. The study indicated PZA resistance in 6% and 49% of susceptible and MDR-TB isolates, respectively. In comparison to the BACTEC MGIT 960 PZA, the PZase assay showed 65.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity, whereas pncA sequencing showed 75% sensitivity and 89.8% specificity. Twenty-four mutation types were found in this study, with the most frequent mutation (16%) being His71Asp. Of these mutations, eight have not been previously described. The Ile31Ser and Ile31Thr mutations were found both in PZA susceptible and resistant isolates, suggesting that mutation of this codon might not play a role on PZA resistance. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that phenotypic susceptibility testing is still essential for the detection of PZA resistance, especially for MDR-TB isolates. Some mutations were not associated with resistance and could lead to misinterpretation of the genotypic methods. This information could be helpful for clinicians in managing tuberculosis patients and frequencies, and the types of pncA mutations should offer baseline information on PZA resistance.

10.1371_journal.pone.0012082	Clinical Prediction Rule for Stratifying Risk of Pulmonary Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Background: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin, is a worldwide problem. Objective: To develop a clinical prediction rule to stratify risk for MDR-TB among patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Methods: Derivation and internal validation of the rule among adult patients prospectively recruited from 37 health centers (Peru), either a) presenting with a positive acid-fast bacillus smear, or b) had failed therapy or had a relapse within the first 12 months. Results: Among 964 patients, 82 had MDR-TB (prevalence, 8.5%). Variables included were MDR-TB contact within the family, previous tuberculosis, cavitary radiologic pattern, and abnormal lung exam. The area under the receiver-operating curve (AUROC) was 0.76. Selecting a cut-off score of one or greater resulted in a sensitivity of 72.6%, specificity of 62.8%, likelihood ratio (LR) positive of 1.95, and LR negative of 0.44. Similarly, selecting a cut-off score of two or greater resulted in a sensitivity of 60.8%, specificity of 87.5%, LR positive of 4.85, and LR negative of 0.45. Finally, selecting a cut-off score of three or greater resulted in a sensitivity of 45.1%, specificity of 95.3%, LR positive of 9.56, and LR negative of 0.58. Conclusion: A simple clinical prediction rule at presentation can stratify risk for MDR-TB. If further validated, the rule could be used for management decisions in resource-limited areas.

10.1164_rccm.200911_1768OC	Development of Extensively Drug-resistant Tuberculosis during Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis Treatment	Rationale: Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) may arise in individuals on treatment for multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. Preventing this amplification of resistance will likely improve clinical outcomes and delay the secondary spread of XDR-TB. Objectives: To measure the proportion of individuals that develops XDR-TB during the course of MDR-TB treatment, and to identify those factors associated with the development of XDR. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 608 consecutive patients with documented MDR-TB who were started on MDR-TB treatment between September 10, 2000 and November 1, 2004 in the Tomsk Oblast TB Treatment Services in Western Siberia, Russian Federation Measurements and Main Results: A total of 6% of patients were observed to develop XDR-TB while on MDR-TB treatment. These patients were significantly less likely to be cured or to complete treatment. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we found that the presence of bilateral and cavitary lesions was associated with a greater than threefold increase in hazard (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 3.47; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.32-9.14). Prior exposure to a second-line injectable antibiotic was associated with a greater than threefold increase in hazard (adjusted HR, 3.65; 95% Cl, 1.81-7.37), and each additional month in which a patient failed to take at least 80% of their prescribed drugs was associated with nearly an additional 20% hazard of developing XDR-TB (adjusted HR, 1.17; 95% Cl, 1.01-1.35). Conclusions: Early and rapid diagnosis, timely initiation of appropriate therapy, and programmatic efforts to optimize treatment adherence during MDR-TB therapy are crucial to avoiding the generation of excess XDR-TB in MDR-TB treatment programs.	antibiotic resistance; acquired resistance, epidemiology, adherence; tuberculosis	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; XDR-TB; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; MIXED INFECTION; SOUTH-AFRICA; RUSSIA; TOMSK; EPIDEMIOLOGY; REINFECTION; COMPLEXITY
10.1016_S1995_7645_10_60158_7	Isolation and identification of MDR-Mycobacterium tuberculosis and screening of partially characterised antimycobacterial compounds from chosen marine micro algae	Objective: To isolate the multiple drug resistance (MDR) Mycobacterium, tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) and to screen for the bioactive compounds extracted from marine microalgae. Methods: Sixty seven collected samples that were confirmed by 168 rDNA analysis as positive with M. tuberculosis infection were subjected to sensitivity test against commercially used front line and second line drugs by absolute concentration method using LJ slants. Seven bacterial isolates numbered 1-78,1-101,1-127,1-173,1-202,1-262,1-327 showed resistant for more than 3 drugs were considered as MDR M. tuberculosis. Thus the percentage of 10.4 were recorded MDR-TB. Fifteen marine micro algal extracts were screened for antimycobacterial activity and partial characterization of the active principles was done. Results: The percentage contribution of marine micro algal species on the extraction of antimycobacterials indicated Isochrysis galbana (I. galbana) contain rich bioactive compounds and accounted for 60% inhibition of the total isolates. The percentage contribution of solvents on the extraction of antimicrobials from I. galbana showed that the methanol, chloroform, n-Butanol showed maximum of extraction. The purified eluted compounds (R(f) 0.43) from TLC plate were chromatographed by gas chromatography. The eluted sterol compounds showed 13 unsaturated sterols with 3 major sterols. Conclusions: The present study indicates the presence of unsaturated fatty acids may have the effect on MDR M. tuberculosis, indicating a potential natural alternative to antibiotics.

10.1016_j.ejmech.2010.04.022	New quinoline derivatives: Synthesis and investigation of antibacterial and antituberculosis properties	Four new series of quinoline derivatives were synthesized starting from 2-trifluoromethyl aniline through multi-step reactions. In the reaction sequence, substituted aniline was cyclized to 4-hydroxy quinoline 1, which was then transformed to 4-chloro-2,8-bis(trifluoromethyl)quinoline 2. The key scaffold 4-hydrazinyl-2,8-bis(trifluoromethyl)quinoline 3, obtained from the compound 2, was successfully converted to target quinoline derivatives, viz. hydrazones 4a-t, ureas 5a-e, thioureas 6a-c and pyrazoles 7a-d, in good yields. The newly synthesized title compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae (recultured) and antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv and MDR-TB. Preliminary results indicated that most of the hydrazone derivatives demonstrated very good antibacterial and antituberculosis activities while other derivatives showed moderate activity.

10.1016_j.ijid.2010.02.2247	Previous treatment in predicting drug-resistant tuberculosis in an area bordering East London, UK	Objectives: To determine the utility of 'risk assessment' in selecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates for rifampin resistance or rpoB genotyping compared to 'non-selectively' genotyping all isolates. Secondly, we examined the association between past treatment and drug resistance. Methods: From January 2003 to December 2006, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were prospectively collected on patients with laboratory-confirmed tuberculosis (TB). On the basis of past treatment for active TB infection or known exposure to drug-resistant TB, selected samples were sent to a mycobacterial reference laboratory for rpoB genotyping. A multivariable logistic regression model was developed to examine the association between past treatment and drug resistance, adjusted for other factors. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of past treatment as a predictor for drug resistance were determined. Results: There were 392 patient episodes of culture-proven TB. Thirty-three drug-resistant isolates were cultured from 30 patients: 29 (87.9%) were isoniazid-resistant, three (9.1%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR), and one (3.0%) was rifampin mono-resistant. One patient with isoniazid resistance developed recurrent disease, and two isolates, initially isoniazid-resistant, mutated and became MDR TB. Based on risk assessment, rpoB genotyping was performed on 19 samples, and two (10.5%) had mutations that predicted multiple drug resistance. Although for MDR TB, a past history of treatment predicted two out of three patients with acquired resistance, adjusted analysis did not demonstrate a significant association between previous treatment of active TB and drug resistance (odds ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4-5.6). The positive predictive value of past treatment as a predictor for drug resistance was 12.0% (95% CI 2.6-31.2%). Conclusion: Although numbers of MDR TB were too small to draw meaningful conclusions, past treatment may be useful in selecting samples for rpoB genotyping. Overall, previous treatment had a low positive predictive value for drug resistance in an area bordering East London.

pub-1465	Case series of the long-term psychosocial impact of drug-resistant tuberculosis in HIV-negative medical doctors	BACKGROUND: Health care workers (HCWs) are at greater risk for tuberculosis (TB), including multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), compared to the general population. The psychosocial impact of nosocomial TB on HCWs has received little attention in the literature. METHODS: A retrospective medical record review from 1999 to 2003 found 15 HCWs who were treated for drug-resistant TB at a specialist hospital in South Africa. Five human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative doctors with no predisposing factors for drug resistance are included in this case series. We collectively present their clinical case histories based on medical records from 2000 to 2005, and explore the long-term psychosocial impact of TB from interviews conducted in 2009. RESULTS: Four doctors had primary MDR-TB and one had primary resistance to multiple first-line drugs. Time from symptom onset to commencement of effective treatment ranged from 8 to 39 weeks. Time for bacteriological confirmation of drug-resistant TB ranged from 6 to 24 weeks. All were cured within 3 years of initial presentation. Content analysis of follow-up interviews revealed five main themes: 1) prolonged morbidity, 2) psychological impact, 3) poor infection control, 4) weak support structures and 5) attrition from the field. CONCLUSION: Themes emergent from this case series encourage prioritisation of TB infection control education and practice to minimise HCW morbidity and prevent HCW attrition from high-burden resource-constrained settings.	drug-resistant tuberculosis; health care workers; South Africa; infection control; psychosocial impact	HEALTH-CARE WORKERS; PREVENTING NOSOCOMIAL TRANSMISSION; RIO-DE-JANEIRO; INFECTION; RISK; DISEASE; PHYSICIANS; COUNTRIES; AFRICA; BRAZIL
pub-1466	National anti-tuberculosis drug resistance study in Tanzania	OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in a national representative sample of tuberculosis (TB) patients in Tanzania according to recommended methodology. DESIGN: Cluster survey, with 40 clusters sampled proportional to size, of notified TB patients from all diagnostic centres in the country. RESULTS: The survey enrolled 1019 new and 148 re-treatment patients. The adjusted prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to any of the four first-line drugs in new patients was 8.3%, while the prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was 1.1%. In retreatment patients, the crude prevalence for any resistance and for MDR-TB was respectively 20.6% and 3.9%. The prevalence of drug resistance did not differ in relapse patients compared to failure patients. These estimates are among the lowest in those African countries with an estimated level of drug resistance in the last 5 years. CONCLUSION: The low levels of drug resistance in Tanzania are likely due to a well performing TB control programme and the absence of noticeable involvement of the private sector in TB treatment.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; survey; MDR; 8-month regimen	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS STRAINS; CETYL-PYRIDINIUM CHLORIDE; GENOTYPE MTBDRPLUS ASSAY; RIFAMPIN; METAANALYSIS; INFECTION; SAMPLES; SPUTA
10.1016_j.trstmh.2010.03.005	Prevalence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in Karachi, Pakistan: identification of at risk groups	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a possible threat to global tuberculosis control. Despite a disease prevalence of 263/100 000 population Pakistan lacks information on prevalence of drug resistant TB. Our objective was to estimate prevalence of MDR and associated risk factors in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in Karachi. Six hundred and forty consenting adult patients were enrolled from field clinics from July 2006 to August 2008 through passive case finding. Prevalence of MDR-TB with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated with Epi-Info. Logistic Regression analyses were performed for risk factors associated with MDR. Overall MDR rate was 5.0%, 95% Cl: 3.3-6.6% (untreated 2.3%, treated 17.9%). Mean age was 32.5 (+/- 15.6) years and there were 292 (45.6%) females and 348 (54.4%) males. Factors independently associated with MDR were: female gender (OR 3.12; 95% CI: 1.40-6.91), and prior history of incomplete treatment (OR 10.1; 95% CI: 4.71-21.64). Ethnic groups at higher risk for MDR included Sindhis (OR 4.5; 95% CI: 1.42-14.71) and Pashtoons (OR 3.6, 95% CI: 1.12-11.62). This study reports an overall MDR rate of 5.0% in our study population. It further highlights the need for MDR prevention through re-focusing Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course DOTS delivery with emphasis on women and certain high risk sub groups.

10.1164_rccm.200911_1656OC	Treatment Outcomes and Survival Based on Drug Resistance Patterns in Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis	Rationale: Few large-scale studies have investigated multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment outcomes relative to drug-resistance patterns. Objectives: To assess the impact of additional drug resistances on treatment outcomes and long-term survival in a large HIV-negative MDR-TB cohort. Methods: Treatment outcomes and long-term survival of patients with MDR-TB newly diagnosed or retreated in 2000 to 2002 were retrospectively analyzed based on drug-resistance patterns after 5-8 years of follow-up. Measurements and Main Results: Of 1,407 patients with MDR-TB, 75 (5.3%) had extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB,) by the revised definition; 159 (11.3%) had ofloxacin-resistant pre-XDR-TB (pre-XDR-TB.); and 117 (8.3%) had second-line injectable drug (SLID)-resistant pre-XDR-TB (pre-XDR-TB(s)). Patients with XDR-TB, showed the lowest treatment success rate (29.3%) and the poorest long-term survival, and XDR-TB(re) was more strongly associated with long-term mortality than XDR-TB as originally defined (hazards ratio [HR], 3.15; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 2.06-4.83; P < 0.001 vs. HR, 2.15; 95% Cl, 1.49-3.09; P < 0.001). Patients with either form of pre-XDR-TB showed poorer cumulative survival than those with ofloxacin-susceptible/SLID-susceptible MDR-TB (P < 0.05 for each comparison). Although streptomycin susceptibility did not affect the treatment outcomes of patients with pre-XDR-TB, streptomycin-resistant pre-XDR-TB was more strongly associated with long-term mortality than ofloxacin-susceptible/SLID-susceptible MDR-TB (HR, 2.17; 95% Cl, 1.22-3.84; P < 0.008 for preXDR-TB.; and HR, 2.69; 95% Cl, 1.40-5.16; P= 0.003 for pre-XDR-TBs). Conclusions: The revised XDR-TB definition is appropriate for defining patients with MDR-TB with the poorest outcomes. Both pre-XDR-TB(o) and pre-XDR-TBs were independently associated with poor long-term survival in patients with MDR-TB. SM susceptibility was linked to better survival in patients with pre-XDR-TB.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; survival rate; treatment outcome; drug susceptibility	FLUOROQUINOLONES; IMPACT; TB
10.1016_j.meegid.2010.03.010	"First case of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis caused by a rare ""Beijing-like"" genotype of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Bogota, Colombia"	"This report describes a first case due to a genetically distinct and relatively rare ""Beijing-like"" strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from a 15 years old female patient who died shortly after the initiation of antituberculous therapy with second-line drugs. Positive cultures obtained from lung, kidney and adrenal glands upon autopsy were identified as Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex characterized by an identical 15-banded IS6110-RFLP pattern, and were found to be resistant to all the 4 first-line antituberculous drugs tested (rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol and streptomycin). Spoligotyping followed by comparison with the SITVIT2 database revealed that the isolate belonged to a rare pattern identified as Spoligotype International Type SIT190, which represents only 1.7% of all the Beijing strains worldwide. We present data on its worldwide distribution and present an evolutionary scenario based on available MIRU typing data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

pub-1470	Availability of second-line drugs and anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing in China: a situational analysis	OBJECTIVE: To assess the availability of second-line drugs (SLDs) and the use of drug susceptibility testing (DST) results for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) in China. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey in 4675 health care facilities, 1960 of which have a dedicated TB clinic, in 12 provinces in China. RESULTS: More than 70% of TB clinics at the provincial and prefecture levels had at least one SLD available compared to 41.8% of facilities at the county/district level. The proportion of facilities at provincial, prefecture and county levels with any fluoroquinolone was respectively 74.1%, 64.9% and 34.5%. Sputum culture was performed at 6.0% of TB clinics at the county level, 37.5% at the prefecture and 59.3% at the provincial levels, while DST was performed only at the prefecture (28.6%) and provincial (44.4%) levels. Only 18% of the facilities that used SLDs for the treatment of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) based treatment regimens on DST results. CONCLUSION: SLDs are widely available in China for the treatment of both TB and other infectious diseases. To prevent the development of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to SLDs, the availability of SLDs should be limited and they should be used with caution in the treatment of MDR-TB.	tuberculosis; second-line drugs; drug resistance; MDR-TB; XDR-TB	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; SURVEILLANCE; EMERGENCE
pub-1471	Evaluation of seven tests for the rapid detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Uganda	SETTINGS: National Tuberculosis (TB) Reference Laboratory and Department of Medical Microbiology, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate head-to-head rapid tests for drug susceptibility testing (DST) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis against rifampicin (RMP) and isoniazid (INH) in a resource-limited setting. METHODS: Thirty-one well-characterised strains of M. tuberculosis were tested with the nitrate reductase assay (NRA), microscopic observation drug susceptibility (MODS), MGIT (TM) 960 (Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tube 960), Genotype MTBDRplus, Alamar blue, MTT and resazurin assays. The proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium was used as the reference test. RESULTS: NRA correctly identified the resistant strains, with 100% sensitivity and specificity. MGIT 960 detected all multidrug-resistant strains but missed one RMP-monoresistant strain. Genotype MTBDRplus detected all RMP-resistant strains, but the sensitivity for detection of INH resistance was lower (88%). Sensitivity and specificity ranged from 86% to 100% for MODS and from 57% to 100% for the Alamar blue, MTT and resazurin assays. Test results were obtained within 2-14 days. CONCLUSION: In the study setting, NRA, MGIT 960 and Genotype MTBDRplus gave excellent detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, with significantly shorter time to results compared to conventional testing.

pub-1472	Molecular epidemiology of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Eastern Taiwan	Taiwan initiated a multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) programme in May 2007. Seventy-seven MDR-TB patients were enrolled from May 2007 to February 2009 in Eastern Taiwan. Isolates of 73 (94%) patients were available for genotyping using spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR (mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number of tandem repeats). Spoligotyping results indicated the Beijing strain as the predominant genotype (n = 48,66%). Of the 73 isolates, 28 (38.4%) had a unique pattern and 45 (61.6%) were clustered pattern strains. Epidemiological links could be established in 21 (46.7%) of the 45 patients with a clustered pattern strain. The proportion of MDR-TB patients with a clustered pattern strain in Eastern Taiwan was high.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; spoligotyping; transmission; MIRU-VNTR	
10.1097_RCT.0b013e3181d472bc	Computed Tomography Features of Extensively Drug-Resistant Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Non-HIV-Infected Patients	Objective: To describe the computed tomography (CT) findings of pulmonary extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in non-HIV-infected patients and to compare them with those of non-XDR multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Methods: Retrospective review of microbiological results and drug-susceptibility tests of 260 non-HIV-infected patients who had been diagnosed with pulmonary MDR-TB from 1994 to 2005 revealed that 47 patients had XDR-TB, whereas the other 213 patients had non-XDR MDR-TB. Twenty of the 47 XDR-TB patients and 85 of the 213 non-XDR MDR-TB patients with available CT examinations were included in this study. Two radiologists reviewed the CT studies in consensus for the presence and extent of micronodules, tree-in-bud appearance, lobular consolidation (<2 cm), consolidation, cavity, bronchiectasis, emphysema, pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy, bronchopleural fistula, and empyema. We then compared the CT features of XDR-TB with those of non-XDR MDR-TB. Results: Micronodules and tree-in-bud appearance were the most frequent CT abnormalities and were seen in all XDR-TB patients (100%). Consolidations, cavities, bronchiectasis, and lobular consolidations were found in 85%, 85%, 80%, and 70% of XDR-TB patients, respectively. The extents of micronodules, tree-in-bud appearance, lobular consolidation, consolidation, cavity, bronchiectasis, and emphysema were 3.60, 3.55, 1.35, 1.85, 1.65, 1.45, and 0.25 lobes, respectively. Compared with non-XDR MDR-TB, XDR-TB showed a significantly larger extent of tree-in-bud appearance and consolidation (P < 0.05). With respect to other CT features, there were no significant differences between XDR-TB and non-XDR MDR-TB. Conclusion: Computed tomography findings of pulmonary XDR-TB are similar to those of non-XDR MDR-TB; however, XDR-TB tends to have more extensive consolidation and tree-in-bud appearance.	lung; tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis; computed tomography	CT
10.7196_SAMJ.3501	Potential for nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis in a South African tertiary hospital	Background. Tuberculosis (TB) is a major health problem in the Western Cape, with an incidence exceeding 900 per 100 000 people. Nosocomial transmission of TB, and particularly drug-resistant TB, is a potential risk that may be undetected. Rapid diagnosis and rapid institution of effective anti-TB treatment, combined with appropriate infection control measures, are essential to prevent nosocomial transmission of TB. To estimate the potential for nosocomial transmission, we aimed to determine the in-hospital delays in diagnosis and treatment of patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB at a tertiary care hospital. Methods. A descriptive study, based on retrospective review of patient records and laboratory data, including all adult patients (>13 years) where TB culture and susceptibility testing confirmed MDR-TB on specimens submitted to Tygerberg Hospital's National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) laboratory in 2007. Results. Thirty-one patients with MDR-TB were identified. The median laboratory turnaround time (TAT) from collection of specimen to confirmation of MDR-TB was 40 days, while the median time from the time of first presentation at Tygerberg Hospital to institution of MDR treatment was 44 days. Twenty patients were considered infectious during their hospital stay, generating 345 inpatient infectious days. Conclusions. The study suggests that there is an ongoing substantial risk for nosocomial transmission of MDR-TB at Tygerberg Hospital. We propose improvements, including the use of rapid drug susceptibility testing. The consistent application of infection control measures to prevent nosocomial spread of TB, including MDR-TB, remains vital.		MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS

These compounds were evaluated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (MTB) and multi-drug-resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Among the compounds screened, the dispiroheterocycle, namely, (5R,6R,105)3,9-bis(4-chloropheny1)-10-(2,4-dichloropheny1)-14-[(E)-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)methylidenel-12-1(R)-1- phenylethyl]-1,4,7-trioxa-2,8,12-tri-azadispiro14.0.4.41tetradeca-2,8-diene 5m was found to possess the maximum activity with MIC of 0.49 p.M against MTB, being 9.6 and 15.6 times more potent than ciprofloxacin and ethambutol, respectively. Against MDR-TB, 5m displayed maximum activity with an MIC of 0.49 uM, with it thus being more active than rifampicin, isoniazid, ciprofloxacin and ethambutol by 7.8, 23, 77 and 124 times, respectively. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

10.1186_1471_2334_10_149	Validation of the GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay for diagnosis of multidrug resistant tuberculosis in South Vietnam	Background: To control multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), the drug susceptibility profile is needed to guide therapy. Classical drug susceptibility testing (DST) may take up to 2 to 4 months. The GenoType (R) MTBDRplus test is a commercially available line-probe assay that rapidly detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) complex, as well as the most common mutations associated with rifampin and isoniazid resistance. We assessed sensitivity and specificity of the assay by using a geographically representative set of MTB isolates from the South of Vietnam. Methods: We re-cultured 111 MTB isolates that were MDR, rifampin-resistant or pan-susceptible according to conventional DST and tested these with the GenoType (R) MTBDRplus test. Results: By conventional DST, 55 strains were classified as MDR-TB, four strains were rifampicin mono-resistant and 52 strains were susceptible to all first-line drugs. The sensitivity of the GenoType (R) MTBDRplus was 93.1% for rifampicin, 92.6% for isoniazid and 88.9% for the combination of both; its specificity was 100%. The positive predictive value of the GenoType (R) MTBDRplus test for MDR-TB was 100% and the negative predictive value 90.3%. Conclusions: We found a high specificity and positive predictive value of the GenoType (R) MTBDRplus test for MDR-TB which merits its use in the MDR-TB treatment program in Vietnam.

10.2217_FMB.10.50	TMC207: the first compound of a new class of potent anti-tuberculosis drugs	Disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis continues as a global epidemic: over 2 billion people harbor latent TB infection, and more than 9 million new TB cases, of whom 500,000 are multidrug-resistant (MDR), and nearly 2 million deaths are estimated to occur each year. New drugs are required to shorten treatment duration of drug-sensitive TB and for the treatment of MDR-TB. TMC207 is a first-in-class diarylquinoline compound with a novel mechanism of action, the inhibition of bacterial ATP synthase, and potent activity against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB. It has bactericidal and sterilizing activity against M. tuberculosis and other mycobacterial species, but little activity against other bacteria. In a Phase II efficacy study conducted in patients with MDR-TB taking TMC207 plus a standard background regimen, the drug appeared to be safe and well tolerated, and showed significant efficacy after 2 months of treatment with conversion rates of sputum culture of 48% (vs 9% in the placebo group). Given the product development partnership between Tibotec and the TB Alliance, the strategies of using TMC207 in shorter first-line regimens or using it in second-line regimens for drug-resistant M. tuberculosis infections are both being pursued. No clinical data of TMC207 in TB patients with HIV coinfection have been published; drug-drug interaction studies with antiretrovirals are being conducted. Finally, the remarkable sterilizing capacity of TMC207 also makes it an attractive drug in the strategy of TB elimination. Current and future studies will determine the role of TMC207 in a shortened treatment regimen for drug-sensitive TB, a more effective and better-tolerated regimen for MDR-TB, the treatment of latent TB infection, and intermittent-TB treatment regimens.	diarylquinolines; R207910; TMC207; tuberculosis	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIAL ATP SYNTHASE; MURINE TUBERCULOSIS; DIARYLQUINOLINE R207910; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; RIFAPENTINE; MODEL; PYRAZINAMIDE; HOMEOSTASIS; DURATION
pub-1478	Management of drug-resistant tuberculosis	Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) in adults is either acquired due to poor treatment management or transmitted from infectious DR-TB cases, while children mainly have transmitted disease. Diagnosis of DR-TB relies on drug susceptibility testing (DST), which is not routinely performed in high tuberculosis (TB) burden settings. The Category II retreatment regimen is inadequate for Category I failures if multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is present. Where possible, DST should be performed for Category I failures and other patients with a high risk of DR-TB. Fluoroquinolones (FQs) should be used with caution in the treatment of mono- and polyresistant TB. Modification of regimens for mono- and polyresistance is prone to error if DST results are not reliable or if there is possible additional drug resistance due to further drug exposure. While standardised treatment is feasible for MDR-TB patients never previously treated with second-line drugs, a different strategy is required for those MDR-TB patients who have previously been treated with second-line drugs. Sputum conversion, adverse effects and adherence to MDR-TB treatment should be monitored closely. The presence of FQ resistance prior to MDR-TB treatment poses a serious challenge. To prevent the development of extensively drug-resistant TB, strategies to protect the FQs, the most important second-line agents, need to be developed. Clinical trials assessing MDR-TB treatment regimens are urgently needed.	tuberculosis; treatment; drug-resistant	SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; STANDARD RETREATMENT REGIMEN; COMMUNITY-BASED THERAPY; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; SOUTH-AFRICA; ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS; RETROSPECTIVE COHORT
pub-1479	Risk of tuberculosis in public transport sector workers, Lima, Peru	SETTING: Delays from symptom onset to the diagnosis and treatment of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) produces possible new cases in persons in close contact with TB cases, especially in confined spaces such as overcrowded public transport, which puts other users and transport workers at risk. OBJECTIVE: To estimate TB incidence rates in patients of a health micro-network, and the percentage of transport sector workers among TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients. DESIGN: Crude and indirect standardised incidence rates of TB were calculated from an exhaustive analysis of all clinical histories of incident patients in a health micro-network between 1 January 2007 and 30 June 2008. The percentage of transport sector workers and the association between MDR-TB and working in the transport sector were analysed. RESULTS: Standardised incidence rates for transport sector workers are 2.7-4.5 times higher than those in the total working-age male and global population of the micro-network studied. The association between TB and transport occupation and MDR-TB and transport occupation is high (respectively OR 3.06, 95%CI 2.2-4.2 and OR 3.14, 95%CI 1.1-9.1). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the use of informal public transport is a risk factor for TB infection and an occupational risk in countries with characteristics similar to those in Peru.	pulmonary tuberculosis; public transport; occupational risk	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS
pub-1480	Responding to the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis crisis: mainstreaming programmatic management to the Philippine National Tuberculosis Programme	SETTING: The Philippines ranks eighth among 27 priority countries for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). OBJECTIVE: To describe a model of public-private partnership in MDR-TB management. METHODS: An exploratory study of integrating MDR-TB management initiated in private-public mix DOTS into the National TB Programme (NTP). RESULTS: Recognising that MDR-TB was a threat to DOTS, the Tropical Disease Foundation initiated MDR-TB management in 1999. An official mandate for the integration of MDR-TB services into the NTP was issued by the Department of Health in 2008. With an increased government budget augmented by support from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, 1294 MDR-TB patients were placed on treatment from 1999 to 2008. The treatment success rate improved from 64% in 1999 to 75% in 2005. There are now five MDR-TB treatment centres with 181 treatment sites in Metro Manila, and three culture centres. People trained include 12 master trainers, 31 trainers, 25 treatment centre and 381 treatment site staff. CONCLUSION: Mainstreaming into the NTP of this unique model of MDR-TB management through a dynamic public-private collaboration can be considered best practice in implementation science of an evidence-based intervention leading to change in health care policy and practice.	multidrug-resistant TB; public-private partnership; Philippines; programmatic management of drug-resistant TB (PMDT); private-public mix (PPM); DOTS	
10.1371_journal.pone.0010893	Drug Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis of the Beijing Genotype Does Not Spread in Sweden	Background: Drug resistant (DR) and multi-drug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) is increasing worldwide. In some parts of the world 10% or more of new TB cases are MDR. The Beijing genotype is a distinct genetic lineage of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is distributed worldwide, and has caused large outbreaks of MDR-TB. It has been proposed that certain lineages of M. tuberculosis, such as the Beijing lineage, may have specific adaptive advantages. We have investigated the presence and transmission of DR Beijing strains in the Swedish population. Methodology/Principal Findings: All DR M. tuberculosis complex isolates between 1994 and 2008 were studied. Isolates that were of Beijing genotype were investigated for specific resistance mutations and phylogenetic markers. Seventy (13%) of 536 DR strains were of Beijing genotype. The majority of the patients with Beijing strains were foreign born, and their country of origin reflects the countries where the Beijing genotype is most prevalent. Multidrug-resistance was significantly more common in Beijing strains than in non-Beijing strains. There was a correlation between the Beijing genotype and specific resistance mutations in the katG gene, the mabA-inhA-promotor and the rpoB gene. By a combined use of RD deletions, spoligotyping, IS1547, mutT gene polymorphism and Rv3135 gene analysis the Beijing strains could be divided into 11 genomic sublineages. Of the patients with Beijing strains 28 (41%) were found in altogether 10 clusters (2-5 per cluster), as defined by RFLP IS6110, while 52% of the patients with non-Beijing strains were in clusters. By 24 loci MIRU-VNTR 31 (45%) of the patients with Beijing strains were found in altogether 7 clusters (2-11 per cluster). Contact tracing established possible epidemiological linkage between only two patients with Beijing strains. Conclusions/Significance: Although extensive outbreaks with non-Beijing TB strains have occurred in Sweden, Beijing strains have not taken hold, in spite of the proximity to high prevalence countries such as Russia and the Baltic countries. The Beijing sublineages so far introduced in Sweden may not be adapted to spread in the Scandinavian population.

10.1371_journal.pone.0010799	Follow-Up of Patients with Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis Four Years after Standardized First-Line Drug Treatment	Background: In 2004, an anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug resistance survey in Heilongjiang province, China, enrolled 1574 (79%) new and 421 (21%) retreatment patients. Multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB was detected in 7.2% of new and 30.4% of retreatment patients. All received treatment with standardized first-line drug (FLD) regimens. Methodology/Principal Findings: We report treatment outcomes of the 2004 cohort, and long-term outcomes as assessed in the second half of 2008. The reported cure rate for MDR-TB patients was 83% (94/113) among new and 66% (85/128) among retreatment patients (P<0.001). Ten of the 241 MDR-TB patients died during treatment. Of the remaining 231, 129 (56%) could be traced in 2008. The overall recurrence rates among new and retreatment cases were 46% and 66%, respectively (P=0.03). The overall death rates among new and retreatment cases were 25% and 46%, respectively (P=0.02). Forty percent of the traced new cases and 24% of the retreatment cases were alive and without recurrent TB (P=0.01). Of the 16 patients who failed or defaulted from treatment in 2004, only two patients were not re-diagnosed with TB by 2008. Of the 111 (86%) patients with an initial successful treatment outcome 63 (57%) had developed recurrent TB, 40 (36%) had died, 27 (24%) of them died of TB. The follow-up period of four years precluded follow-up of all patients. In a highly conservative sensitivity analysis in which we assumed that all non-included patients were alive and did not have recurrent TB, the recurrence and death rate were 33% and 21%. Conclusions/Significance: Documentation of cure based on conventional smear microscopy was a poor predictor of long term outcomes. MDR-TB patients in Heilongjiang province in China had high recurrence and death rates four years after treatment with standardized FLD regimens, reinforcing the need for early diagnosis and treatment of MDR-TB, including assessment of treatment outcomes with more sensitive laboratory methods.

10.1186_1471_2334_10_123	Validation of the GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay for detection of MDR-TB in a public health laboratory in Thailand	"Background: Over the past several years, new diagnostic techniques have been developed to allow for the rapid detection of multidrug resistant tuberculosis. The GenoType (R) MTBDRplus test is a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strip assay which uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization to detect genetic mutations in the genes that confer isoniazid (INH) and rifampn (RIF) resistance. This assay has demonstrated good performance and a rapid time to results, making this a promising tool to accelerate MDR-TB diagnosis and improve MDR-TB control. Validation of rapid tests for MDR-TB detection in different settings is needed to ensure acceptable performance, particularly in Asia, which has the largest number of MDR-TB cases in the world but only one previous report, in Vietnam, about the performance of the GenoType (R) MDRplus assay. Thailand is ranked 18(th) of 22 ""high-burden"" TB countries in the world, and there is evidence to suggest that rates of MDR-TB are increasing in Thailand. We compared the performance of the GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay to Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube for Antimycobacterial Susceptibility Testing (MGIT AST) for detection INH resistance, RIF resistance, and MDR-TB in stored acid-fast bacilli (AFB)-positive sputum specimens and isolates at a Public TB laboratory in Bangkok, Thailand. Methods: 50 stored isolates and 164 stored AFB-positive sputum specimens were tested using both the MGIT AST and the GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay. Results: The GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay had a sensitivity of 95.3%, 100%, and 94.4% for INH resistance, RIF resistance, and MDR-TB, respectively. The difference in sensitivity between sputum specimens (93%) and isolates (100%) for INH resistance was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). Specificity was 100% for all resistance patterns and for both specimens and isolates. The laboratory processing time was a median of 25 days for MGIT AST and 5 days for the GenoType (R) MTBDRplus (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The GenoType (R) MTBDRplus assay has been validated as a rapid and reliable first-line diagnostic test on AFB-positive sputum or MTB isolates for INH resistance, RIF resistance, and MDR-TB in Bangkok, Thailand. Further studies are needed to evaluate its impact on treatment outcome and the feasibility and cost associated with widespread implementation."

10.1097_MCP.0b013e3283378680	Drug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in southern Africa	Purpose of review Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is of increasing global concern. One of the hardest hit regions is southern Africa. This study focuses on a concise update on recently published developments in the field. Recent findings There is mounting evidence from high-coprevalence areas that the TB and HIV pandemics must be viewed as an entity and tackled together. In that context, it has become clear that a shift may be required from standard hospital-based models of care towards community-based approaches. Innovative rapid diagnostics to detect TB drug resistance suitable for the use in resource-poor settings and novel drugs effective against drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains are currently developed. Summary In order to allow for a maximum impact of novel interventions on the problem of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB, public health systems and existing TB programs must be strengthened significantly.	extensive drug resistance; HIV/AIDS; multidrug resistance; southern Africa; tuberculosis	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; XDR-TB; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; ALCOHOL-USE; RISK-FACTOR; MDR-TB; METAANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT; EPIDEMIOLOGY
10.1016_j.diagmicrobio.2009.12.007	Systematic interpretation of molecular beacon polymerase chain reaction for identifying rpoB mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates with mixed resistant and susceptible bacteria	Detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), a frequent cause of treatment failure, takes 2 or more weeks to identify by culture. Rifampicin (RIF) resistance is a hallmark of MDR-TB, and detection of mutations in the rpoB gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using molecular beacon probes with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a novel approach that takes days. However, qPCR identification of resistant isolates, particularly for isolates with mixed RIF-susceptible and RIF-resistant bacteria, is reader dependent and limits its clinical use. The aim of this study was to develop an objective, reader-independent method to define rpoB mutants using beacon qPCR. This would facilitate the transition from a research protocol to the clinical setting, where high-throughput methods with objective interpretation are required. For this, DNAs from 107 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates with known susceptibility to RIF by culture-based methods were obtained from 2 regions where isolates have not previously been subjected to evaluation using molecular beacon qPCR: the Texas Mexico border and Colombia. Using coded DNA specimens, mutations within an 81-bp hot spot region of rpoB were established by qPCR with 5 beacons spanning this region. Visual and mathematical approaches were used to establish whether the qPCR cycle threshold of the experimental isolate was significantly higher (mutant) compared to a reference wild-type isolate. Visual classification of the beacon qPCR required reader training for strains with a mixture of RIF-susceptible and RIF-resistant bacteria. Only then had the visual interpretation by an experienced reader had 100% sensitivity and 94.6% specificity versus RIF resistance by culture phenotype and 98.1% sensitivity and 100% specificity versus mutations based on DNA sequence. The mathematical approach was 98% sensitive and 94.5% specific versus culture and 96.2% sensitive and 100% specific versus DNA sequence. Our findings indicate the mathematical approach has advantages over the visual reading, in that it uses a Microsoft Excel template to eliminate reader bias or inexperience, and allows objective interpretation from high-throughput analyses even in the presence of a mixture of RIF-resistant and RIF-susceptible isolates without the need for reader training.

10.4081_gh.2010.201	Accounting for autocorrelation in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis predictors using a set of parsimonious orthogonal eigenvectors aggregated in geographic space	Spatial autocorrelation is problematic for classical hierarchical cluster detection tests commonly used in multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) analyses as considerable random error can occur. Therefore, when MDR-TB clusters are spatially autocorrelated the assumption that the clusters are independently random is invalid. In this research, a product moment correlation coefficient (i.e. the Moran's coefficient) was used to quantify local spatial variation in multiple clinical and environmental predictor variables sampled in San Juan de Lurigancho, Lima, Peru. Initially, QuickBird (spatial resolution = 0.61 m) data, encompassing visible bands and the near infra-red bands, were selected to synthesize images of land cover attributes of the study site. Data of residential addresses of individual patients with smear-positive MDR-TB were geocoded, prevalence rates calculated and then digitally overlaid onto the satellite data within a 2 km buffer of 31 georeferenced health centres, using a 10 m(2) grid-based algorithm. Geographical information system (GIS)gridded measurements of each health centre were generated based on preliminary base maps of the georeferenced data aggregated to block groups and census tracts within each buffered area. A three-dimensional model of the study site was constructed based on a digital elevation model (DEM) to determine terrain covariates associated with the sampled MDR-TB covariates. Pearson's correlation was used to evaluate the linear relationship between the DEM and the sampled MDR-TB data. A SAS/GIS(R) module was then used to calculate univariate statistics and to perform linear and non-linear regression analyses using the sampled predictor variables. The estimates generated from a global autocorrelation analyses were then spatially decomposed into empirical orthogonal bases, using a negative binomial regression with a non-homogeneous mean. Results of the DEM analyses indicated a statistically non-significant, linear relationship between georeferenced health centres and the sampled covariate elevation. The data exhibited positive spatial autocorrelation and the decomposition of Moran's coefficient into uncorrelated, orthogonal map pattern components which revealed global spatial heterogeneities necessary to capture latent autocorrelation in the MDR-TB model. It was thus shown that Poisson regression analyses and spatial eigenvector mapping can elucidate the mechanics of MDR-TB transmission by prioritizing clinical and environmental-sampled predictor variables for identifying high risk populations.	multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; geographical information system; digital elevation model; Poisson regression analyses; spatial eigenvector mapping; Peru	CULEX-RESTUANS; MODEL; ILLINOIS; PIPIENS
10.1016_j.ijid.2009.07.002	Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment outcome in Iran: a case series of seven patients	Background: Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has recently been identified as a major threat to global health. XDR-TB poses a risk of higher failure rates and death during TB treatment. We report herein the outcomes of XDR-TB in patients treated with the standardized regimen in Iran. Patients and methods: Between 2002 and 2006, seven patients were diagnosed with XDR-TB. All patients were treated with the standardized second-line regimen containing cycloserine, prothionamide, amikacin, and ofloxacin. First-line drugs, such as ethambutol and pyrazinamide, were added to the regimen if drug susceptibility testing showed sensitivity to these drugs. Results: Four (57.1%) patients were male. All seven patients were HIV-negative. The patient age range was 22-79 years. Of the seven cases, the final outcome was 'cure' in two (28.6%), 'relapse' in one, 'treatment failure' in one, and 'death' in two; the outcome for one patient was unknown. Conclusion: Our study shows a poor prognosis in patients with XDR-TB. This indicates the necessity of detecting XDR-TB cases earlier, as well as the need to gain access to more second-line agents. This is particularly important in resource-limited settings in order to administer individualized regimens. (C) 2009 International Society for Infectious Diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

10.1016_j.ijid.2009.06.030	The potential to transmit Mycobacterium tuberculosis at a South African tertiary teaching hospital	Objectives: To assess the risk of nosocomial transmission by confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients in a high TB/HIV incidence environment. Methods: Between November 2006 and April 2007, we carried out a cross-sectional survey of PTB patients with positive smears or cultures at an academic tertiary hospital in the Western Cape, South Africa. Results: Of 394 confirmed PTB patients, only 199 (50.5%) had a known HIV status, of whom 107 (53.8%) were HIV-co-infected. Sensitivity testing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) was done in 49.3% of patients with available cultures (140/284). Of these patients, 9.3% (13/140) had multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB strains. The turnaround times (TAT) for culture and susceptibility testing were delayed: mean TAT for cultures was 27 days (range 63 days) and for susceptibility testing was 42 days (range 63 days). One fifth of PTB patients (82/394) were diagnosed from wards that do not deal with TB on a daily basis. PTB inpatients were hospitalized for an average of 13 days and were on average transferred twice. Only 14.2% of all PTB patients were notified to the South Africa Provincial Department of Health. Throughout their hospitalization, PTB patients were potentially infectious. Conclusions: The potential for nosocomial TB transmission in a setting of high TB and HIV co-infection with a high MDR prevalence, inconsistent infection prevention and control measures, and delayed diagnosis cannot be ignored. Barriers to TB infection control must urgently be addressed. (C) 2009 International Society for Infectious Diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

pub-1489	Preventing the next generation of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis	Multidrug-resistant and extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis strains threaten to become an intractable problem. Misuse of antibiotics and inadequacy of diagnostic tools have fostered drug resistance. Effective diagnostic technology would eliminate this problem, but it remains unavailable in high-burden areas. New drugs with novel targets may help combat drug resistance. However, if added singly to existing combination regimens, resistance will increase. To protect the efficacy of a new drug, it should first be used only as a second-line drug, in cases that have undergone drug susceptibility testing. Widespread use of new drugs as first-line agents would follow with the dawn of a new rapid diagnostic era.	MDR-TB; XDR-TB; drug development	
pub-1490	Methodological issues in the design of clinical trials for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: challenges and opportunities	The burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is increasing dramatically in the world today, severely hampering global TB control. Treatment of MDR-TB is complex, prolonged, expensive and requires appropriate clinical and laboratory infrastructure. The majority of MDR-TB patients still do not have access to adequate diagnostic services or quality assured second-line drugs, leading to high levels of morbidity and mortality. More effective and efficient MDR-TB treatment with reduced toxicity that could be safely delivered to patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an urgent research priority that could be cost-saving for health systems overall. In this context, understanding how best to design and execute randomised controlled trials to improve MDR-TB treatment has taken on new urgency, to identify the optimal combination(s) of existing and new drugs to assemble in efficient and safe regimen(s), preferably of short duration, that can be easily delivered to patients and safely combined with antiretroviral treatment. In the present report, we address the methodological issues in the design and execution of Phase H and Phase HI trials arising from this goal. We suggest that a rational selection of appropriate designs and outcome measures, associated with the application of new diagnostic technology, could overcome many of the methodological and logistical problems. These advances could be key to historic improvements in the treatment of patients suffering from MDR-TB, and perhaps ultimately drug-susceptible TB. As with HIV, clinical trials in patients with drug-resistant disease may provide a quicker and less expensive path to licensure than trials for treatment of drug-susceptible disease.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; clinical trial; drug development; trial design; methodology	SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; HIV-INFECTION; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; PHASE-II; MOXIFLOXACIN; DRUGS; TB; METAANALYSIS; DEFINITION
10.1177_147323001003800345	Factors Associated with Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis: Comparison of Patients Born Inside and Outside of the Czech Republic	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is defined as resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB) to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare a cohort of 50 patients with MDR-TB according to birthplace, resistance type, clinical outcome, length of bacteriological positivity of sputum and length of hospitalization. Thirty-three of the patients were born in the Czech were Republic (group A) and 17 immigrants to the Czech Republic (group B). Patients in group B were significantly younger (mean [range] age 33 [19 - 56] years) than those in group A (mean [range] age 48 [33 - 80] years). Primary resistance was present in 16 (48%) cases in group A and in 13 (76%) cases in group B. There were 36 (72%) cured patients, five (10%) remained on treatment and nine (18%) died; no patients failed or transferred out of the study. The mean length of bacteriological positivity of sputum samples was 5.9 months and the mean length of hospitalization was 8.2 months. Resistance to capreomycin was an important predictor of poor outcome.

10.1371_journal.pone.0010191	Fitness of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Strains of the W-Beijing and Non-W-Beijing Genotype	Background: Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major threat for global tuberculosis control. The W-Beijing Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotype has been associated with drug resistance. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying this epidemiological finding may have an important role in the control of MDR-TB. The aim of this study was to evaluate the fitness of drug-susceptible and MDR M. tuberculosis strains of the W-Beijing genotype compared with that of Non-W-Beijing strains. Methodology/Principal Findings: Fitness of M. tuberculosis strains was determined by evaluating the difference in the growth curves obtained in the MGIT960 automated system and assessing the competitive growth capacity between W-Beijing and non-W-Beijing strains. The W-Beijing MDR strains had a significant longer lag phase duration compared to the other strains but did not present a significant fitness cost. When grown in competition they had an advantage only in medium containing 0.1% Tween 80. Conclusions/Significance: It was not possible to confirm a selective advantage of W-Beijing strains to grow, except for differences in their resistance to Tween 80. Further studies are needed to elucidate the putative advantage of W-Beijing strains compared to other genotypes.

10.1128_AAC.01471_09	Dry Powder PA-824 Aerosols for Treatment of Tuberculosis in Guinea Pigs	Novel treatments for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), or latent TB are needed urgently. Recently, we reported the formulation and characterization of the nitroimidazo-oxazine PA-824 for efficient aerosol delivery as dry powder porous particles and the subsequent disposition in guinea pigs after pulmonary administration. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of these PA-824 therapeutic aerosols on the extent of TB infection in the low-inoculum aerosol infection guinea pig model. Four weeks after infection by the pulmonary route, animals received daily treatment for 4 weeks of either a high or a low dose of PA-824 dry powder aerosol. Animals received PA-824 cyclodextrin/ lecithin suspensions orally as positive controls, and those receiving placebo particles or no treatment were negative controls. The lungs and spleens of animals receiving the high dose of inhaled PA-824 particles exhibited a lower degree of inflammation (indicated by wet tissue weights), bacterial burden, and tissue damage (indicated by histopathology) than those of untreated or placebo animals. Treatment with oral PA-824 cyclodextrin/lecithin suspension resulted in a more significant reduction in the bacterial burden of lungs and spleen, consistent with a dose that was larger than inhaled doses (eight times the inhaled low dose and four times the inhaled high dose). However, histopathological analysis revealed that the extent of tissue damage was comparable in groups receiving the oral or either inhaled dose. The present studies indicate the potential use of PA-824 dry powder aerosols in the treatment of TB.

10.1086_651119	Detection of a Substantial Rate of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in an HIV-Infected Population in South Africa by Active Monitoring of Sputum Samples	Background. Tuberculosis (TB) coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a substantial problem in South Africa. There has been a presumption that drug-resistant strains of TB are common in South Africa, but few studies have documented this impression. Methods. In Phidisa, a joint observational and randomized HIV treatment study for South African National Defence Force members and dependents, an initiative was launched to test subjects ( by use of microbiologic TB test) who appeared to be at high risk. We report results for HIV-infected subjects. Results. TB was identified by culture in 116 (19.9%) of 584 patients selected for sputum examination on the basis of suggestive symptoms. Smear was an insensitive technique for confirming the diagnosis: only 33% of culture-positive patients were identified by smear, with a 0.2% false-positive rate. Of the 107 culture-positive individuals with susceptibility testing, 22 (20.6%) were identified to be multidrug resistant (MDR), and 4 (3.7%) were identified to be extensively drug resistant. Culture-positive cases with a history of TB treatment had more than twice the rate of MDR than those without (27.1% vs 11.9%; P = .05). Conclusions. TB is common in this cohort of HIV-infected patients. Smear was not a sensitive technique for identifying culture-positive cases in this health system. Drug susceptibility testing is essential to proper patient management because MDR was present in 20.6% of culture-positive patients. Better management strategies are needed to reduce the development of MDR TB, because so many of these patients had received prior antituberculous therapy that was presumably not curative.

10.1111_j.1469_0691.2009.02838.x	Genotypic analysis of genes associated with isoniazid and ethionamide resistance in MDR-TB isolates from Thailand	P>Nucleotide sequences of genes conferring isoniazid resistance (katG, inhA, oxyR-ahpC and ndh) and ethionamide resistance (ethA) in 160 drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from Thailand were analysed. Mutations in the katG gene were found in 129 isolates, predominantly at codon 315, which was mutated in 127 isolates. Twenty-two isolates had mutations in the inhA promoter and coding region. Mutations in the oxyR-ahpC intergenic region and in ndh were detected in four and one isolate(s), respectively. Of 24 ethionamide-resistant isolates, 13 had mutations in the ethA gene. However, these mutations were dispersed along the entire gene, with no codon predominating significantly.

10.4103_0255_0857.62497	Combined drug medium with isoniazid and rifampicin for identification of multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis	A low-cost method of detecting multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) with the possibility of quick adoption in a resource limited setting is urgently required. We conducted a study combining isoniazid and rifampicin in a single LJ medium, to detect MDR-TB strains. Combined and individual drug media showed 100% concordance for the detection of MDR-TB and susceptible strains by proportion method. Considering the results, combined isoniazid and rifampicin containing medium could be considered for use in settings where the sole detection of MDR-TB strains is justified.

pub-1497	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: epidemiology, risk factors and case finding	Although the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) epidemic is a very recent problem, many studies have attempted to understand it. We now have good estimates of the current burden (approximately 500000 MDR-TB cases worldwide), and following the introduction of potential MDR-TB control strategies projections of these figures are being estimated. The projected trends in tuberculosis (TB) and MDR-TB incidence vary. Risk factors for resistance can be divided into two categories: 1) those facilitating the selection of resistance in the community and 2) the specific conditions that appear to increase some patients' vulnerability to resistance. The epidemiological situation varies greatly across countries, principally due to poor treatment practices and poor implementation of control programmes in the past and even today, to a lesser degree and recent data have suggested that national TB programmes that use existing drugs efficiently can postpone and even reverse the MDR-TB epidemic. Other factors that have also contributed to this epidemic situation are analysed in this article. The recognition of factors leading to the epidemic in some regions and the identification of populations at risk will assist in focusing case-finding efforts. From an individual perspective, treatment failures with first-line rifampicin-containing regimens and contacts of MDR-TB cases have the highest rates of resistance. Patients previously treated for TB and the other risk factors analysed in this article should be prioritised in case finding.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; extensively drug-resistant; epidemiology; case finding; risk factor	SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; DRUG-RESISTANCE; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; HIV-INFECTION; RETREATMENT; TRANSMISSION; PREVALENCE
pub-1498	High treatment failure and default rates for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, 2000-2003	SETTING: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has emerged as a significant public health threat in South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To describe treatment outcomes and determine risk factors associated with unfavorable outcomes among MDR-TB patients admitted to the provincial TB referral hospital in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study of MDR-TB patients admitted from 2000 to 2003. RESULTS: Of 1209 MDR-TB patients with documented treatment outcomes, 491 (41%) were cured, 35 (3%) completed treatment, 208 (17%) failed treatment, 223 (18%) died and 252 (21%) defaulted. Of the total number of patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, 52% were HIV-infected. Treatment failure, death and default each differed in their risk factors. Greater baseline resistance (aOR 2.3-3.0), prior TB (aOR 1.7), and diagnosis in 2001, 2002 or 2003 (aOR 1.9-2.3) were independent risk factors for treatment failure. HIV co-infection was a risk factor for death (aOR 5.6), and both HIV (aOR 2.0) and male sex (aOR 1.9) were risk factors for treatment default. CONCLUSION: MDR-TB treatment outcomes in KwaZulu-Natal were substantially worse than those published from other MDR-TB cohorts. Interventions such as concurrent antiretroviral therapy and decentralized MDR-TB treatment should be considered to improve MDR-TB outcomes in this high HIV prevalence setting.	drug resistance; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; treatment outcomes; South Africa	RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS; HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; XDR-TB; EXOGENOUS REINFECTION; MDR-TB; MANAGEMENT; THERAPY; RESECTION; RISK
pub-1499	Community-based treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa	SETTING: Hlabisa health sub-district, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To describe the establishment of a community-based multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment programme embedded in the district TB control programme and to evaluate whether early outcomes are comparable to those in the traditional hospital-based model of care. DESIGN: Cases who initiated community-based MDR-TB treatment (CM) between March and December 2008 were compared with patients who initiated MDR-TB treatment under the traditional hospital-based model of care (TM) between January 2001 and February 2008. Time to initiation of treatment and time to sputum smear and culture conversion were compared for the two groups in Kaplan-Meier survival curves using the Mantel-Cox log-rank test. RESULTS: Overall, 50 CM cases and 57 TM cases were included; 39 of the 50 CM cases (78.0%) were human immunodeficiency virus positive. The median time to initiation of treatment was 84 days for CM and 106.5 days for TM (P = 0.002). Median time to sputum smear conversion was shorter for CM than TM (59 vs. 92 days, P = 0.055), as was time to sputum culture conversion (85 vs. 119 days, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Community-based treatment for MDR-TB can be implemented within the existing TB control programme in rural South Africa and should be scaled up where resources allow.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; HIV	HIGH HIV-PREVALENCE; MDR-TB; XDR-TB; INFECTION; MANAGEMENT; EMERGENCE; THERAPY; PROGRAM
pub-1500	Recent nosocomial transmission and genotypes of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis	SETTING: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a serious health problem in Eastern European countries, including Latvia. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the proportion of tuberculosis, including MDR-TB cases, attributable to recent transmission and risk factors associated with clustering. DESIGN: Retrospective nested case-control study. The data set incorporated a wide spectrum of social features, as well as genotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates determined by insertion sequence 6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of PvuII cleaved genomic DNA and spoligotyping. RESULTS: In comparison with non-clustered M. tuberculosis, the Beijing genotype (OR 12.15) and multidrug resistance (OR 5.61, P < 0.01) were associated with clustering. In comparison with clustered drug-susceptible M. tuberculosis, clustering of MDR M. tuberculosis was associated with Beijing genotype (OR 41.67), previous hospitalisation (OR 18.33) and previous TB treatment (OR 17.68, P < 0.05). Direct epidemiological links in hospitals were found for almost one third (32%) of MDR Beijing cases. CONCLUSIONS: MDR cases were more likely to be found in clusters than drug-susceptible cases (74.0% vs. 33.6%). Recent nosocomial transmission of MDR-TB is an important risk factor for the spread of multiresistance, and is associated with the Beijing genotype. Special attention should be paid to infection control measures in hospitals and ambulatory treatment should be enforced.	tuberculosis; recent transmission; multidrug resistance; nosocomial transmission	MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; BEIJING GENOTYPE; RISK-FACTORS; PREVALENCE; STRAINS; AREA; REACTIVATION; REINFECTION; POPULATION
pub-1501	Predictors and mortality associated with treatment default in pulmonary tuberculosis	OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for default from pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) treatment and to assess mortality associated with default in Estonia. DESIGN: All patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB who started treatment during 2003-2005 were included in a retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: In 1107 eligible patients, the treatment success rate was 81.5% and the default rate 9.4% (respectively 60.4% and 17.0% in multidrug-resistant TB [MDR-TB]). Independent predictors of treatment default were alcohol abuse (OR 3.22, 95 %CI 1.93-5.38), unemployment (OR 3.05, 95%CI 1.84-5.03), MDR-TB (OR 2.17, 95%CI 1.35-3.50), urban residence (OR 1.85, 95%CI 1.00-3.42) and previous incarceration (OR 1.78, 95%CI 1.05-3.03). Of the defaulters, 29.4% died during followup (median survival 342.0 days). Cox regression analysis revealed that unemployment was associated with all-cause and TB-related mortality among defaulters (respectively HR 4.58, 95 %CI 1.05-20.1 and HR 11.2, 95%CI 1.58-80.2). HIV infection (HR 51.2, 95%CI 6.06-432), sputum smear positivity (HR 9.59, 95%CI 1.79-51.4), MDR-TB (HR 8.56, 95%CI 1.81-40.4) and previous TB (HR 5.15, 95%CI 1.64-16.2) were predictors of TB-related mortality. CONCLUSION: The main risk factors for treatment default can be influenced. Interventions to reduce default should therefore concentrate on socially disadvantaged patients and prevention of alcohol abuse, with special attention given to MDR-TB patients.	mortality; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; pulmonary tuberculosis; treatment default	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; RISK-FACTORS; RUSSIA
pub-1502	Drug Resistance Pattern in Multidrug Resistance Pulmonary Tuberculosis Patients	Objective: To evaluate the frequency of drug resistance profiles of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates of pulmonary tuberculosis patients, against both the first and the second line drugs. Study Design: An observational study. Place and Duration of Study: The multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) ward of Ojha Institute of Chest Diseases (OICD), Karachi, from 1996 to 2006. Methodology: Culture proven MDR-TB cases (resistant to both isoniazid and Rifampicin) were retrospectively reviewed. Susceptibility testing was performed at the clinical laboratory of the Aga Khan University. Sensitivity against both first and second line anti-tuberculosis drugs was done. Susceptibility testing was performed using Agar proportion method on enriched middle brook 7H10 medium (BBL) for Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Streptomycin, Ethambutol, Ethionamide, Capreomycin and Ciprofloxacin. Pyrazinamide sensitivity was carried out using the BACTEC 7H12 medium. During the study period MTB H37Rv was used as control. Results: Out of total 577 patients, all were resistant to both Rifampicin and Isoniazid (INH). 56.5% isolates were resistant to all five first line drugs. Resistances against other first line drugs was 76.60% for Pyrazinamide, 73% for Ethambutol and 68.11% for Streptomycin. Five hundred and ten (88%) cases were MDR plus resistant to one more first line drug. Forty (07%) isolates were MDR plus Quin lone-resistant. They were sensitive to Capreomycin but sensitivity against Amikacin and Kanamycin were not tested. Conclusion: There were high resistance rates in MDR-TB to remaining first line and second line drugs. Continuous monitoring of drug resistance pattern especially of MDR isolates and treatment in specialized centers is a crucial need for future TB control in Pakistan.

10.1093_jac_dkq017	Linezolid use for treatment of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, New York City, 2000-06	Linezolid may be effective for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB); however, serious adverse events are common and there is little information on the management of these toxicities. We retrospectively reviewed public health and medical records of 16 MDR TB patients, including 10 patients with XDR TB, who were treated with linezolid in New York City between January 2000 and December 2006, to determine treatment outcomes and describe the incidence, management and predictors of adverse events. Linezolid was added to MDR TB regimens for a median duration of 16 months (range: 1-29). Eleven patients (69%) completed treatment, four (25%) died and one (6%) discontinued treatment without relapse. Myelosuppression occurred in 13 (81%) patients a median of 5 weeks (range: 1-11) after starting linezolid, gastrointestinal adverse events occurred in 13 (81%) patients after a median of 8 weeks (range: 1-57) and neurotoxicity occurred in seven (44%) patients after a median of 16 weeks (range: 10-111). Adverse events were managed by combinations of temporary suspension of linezolid, linezolid dose reduction and symptom management. Five (31%) patients required eventual discontinuation of linezolid. Myelosuppression was more responsive to clinical management strategies than was neurotoxicity. Leucopenia and neuropathy occurred more often in males and older age was associated with thrombocytopenia (P < 0.05). The majority of MDR TB patients on linezolid had favourable treatment outcomes, although treatment was complicated by adverse events that required extensive clinical management.

10.3109_00365540903456282	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: Treatment outcome in Denmark, 1992-2007	A retrospective nationwide study including all culture-verified multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) cases was performed in Denmark. The aim was to examine the long-term treatment outcome of MDR-TB, to assess if MDR-TB transmission occurs, and to evaluate a rapid mutation analysis detecting rifampin and isoniazid resistance in this cohort. Clinical data were obtained from patient records. A restriction fragment length polymorphism genotype database of all TB cases was compared for identical strains indicating active transmission. Twenty-nine cases of MDR-TB were identified and the incidence was low at 0.5%. Acquired MDR-TB and active transmission was rare. Mutations in rifampin (rpoB) and isoniazid (katG, inhA) genes correctly determined resistance in 100% and 82% of all isolates tested, respectively. Initial treatment success was 89% for 27 MDR-TB patients with available outcome data. Initially 3 patients defaulted; no deaths were reported. Including successfully re-treated default patients and censoring patients who spent < 2 y in the cohort, long-term treatment success was achieved for all 26 patients (mean follow-up 8.9 y). MDR-TB has a good prognosis in the high-income, low TB burden country of Denmark. Continued surveillance and rapid detection of resistance mutations directly in smear-positive patients may improve the standard of MDR-TB care.

10.1016_j.bbrc.2010.02.075	Investigation of mitochondrial sequence variants associated with aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity in South African TB patients on aminoglycosides	A known side effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics is the development of permanent hearing loss. As South Africa is currently facing a tuberculosis (TB) epidemic, with an increasing number of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) infections, the use of aminoglycosides is on the increase. It is therefore important to determine whether the mitochondrial mutations associated with aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss occur at high frequencies in particular ethnic groups in our population. A total of 115 mainly MDR-TB patients all on aminoglycosides and 439 controls representative of the main ethnic groups in South Africa were screened for six mutations using the SNaPshot technique. Furthermore, the mitochondrial genomes of eight patients with ototoxicity were sequenced. Homoplasmic mutations were found in controls (A1555G in 0.9% of Black controls and A827G in 1.1% of Afrikaner controls) which reveal that a significant proportion of the South African population is genetically predisposed to developing aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss. The 961delT+insC((n)) and T961G variants were found at frequencies of >1% indicating that both are probably non-pathogenic polymorphisms. Sequencing of the entire mitochondrial genome in eight patients did not reveal any mutations in the MT-RNR1 gene. However, two potentially pathogenic variants, T10114C (I19T in MT-ND3) and T15312C (I189T in MT-CYB) were found that may impact on the oxidative phosphorylation capacity and warrant further investigation for their possible role in this disorder. It is imperative that the genetic basis of this potentially preventable condition be investigated, particularly in countries where aminoglycosides are still commonly used, in order to identify individuals and/or ethnic groups who are at risk for this type of hearing loss.

pub-1506	Global policies and practices for managing persons exposed to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: In the 1960s, treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) with isoniazid proved to be so effective, safe, and inexpensive that research into alternative treatments virtually ceased. Now that multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is widespread, no data are available to guide the management of persons exposed to MDR-TB (contacts). METHODS: We surveyed National TB Program directors and MDR-TB program managers about current practices for managing MDR-TB contacts in countries with an MDR-TB prevalence of >2% in new patients and those with programs for managing MDR-TB. RESULTS: Of 35 countries that met the survey criteria, 25 (71%) responded; 24 of these (96%) have a guideline for managing TB contacts. Of these, 19 (76%) usually or always evaluated contacts and treated LTBI. In contrast, 10 (40%) countries reported having a guideline for managing MDR-TB contacts, 11 (44%) usually or always evaluated MDR-TB contacts, and 9 (36%) treated LTBI. Only two (8%) used a regimen that has activity against MDR-TB. Lack of evidence or guidelines was the main reason for not treating MDR-TB contacts. CONCLUSIONS: Management of MDR-TB contacts is inconsistent and ineffective due to lack of evidence-based guidelines. There is an urgent need to generate evidence to guide policy.	tuberculosis; contact tracing; tuberculosis, multidrug-resistant; child	CONTACT INVESTIGATIONS; HOUSEHOLD CONTACTS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; LATENT TUBERCULOSIS; PREVENTIVE THERAPY; CONTROLLED TRIAL; YOUNG-CHILDREN; UNITED-STATES; HONG-KONG
pub-1507	Adverse events related to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment, Latvia, 2000-2004	SETTING: Latvia has one of the highest rates of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) globally. Clinical management of MDR-TB requires lengthy multidrug regimens that often cause adverse events. DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed records of patients who began MDR-TB treatment between 2000 and 2004. Treatment-related adverse events and factors associated with experiencing adverse events were evaluated. We also examined the frequency of and reasons for changing drug regimens. RESULTS: Among 1027 cases, 807 (79%) experienced at least one adverse event, with a median of three events per case. The most commonly reported events were nausea (58%), vomiting (39%) and abdominal pain (24%). More serious events, such as psychiatric episodes (13%), hepatitis (9%) and renal failure (4%), were relatively frequent. A change in drug dose due to an adverse event occurred in 201 (20%) cases, while 661 (64%) had at least one drug discontinued temporarily or permanently. Being older, female, having bilateral lung cavities and a greater number of TB symptoms at baseline were associated with an increased number of events. CONCLUSION: Adverse events were prevalent among MDR-TB cases treated in Latvia, with over two thirds requiring discontinuation of at least one drug. MDR-TB patients who are female, older or have severe TB disease should be closely monitored for treatment-related adverse events.	tuberculosis; multidrug resistance; adverse events; Latvia	
pub-1508	Elevation of CD56(bright)CD16(-) Lymphocytes in MDR Pulmonary Tuberculosis	Background: Protective immune responses induced in the majority of people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis enable them to control TB infection. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate CD56 and CD16 positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and leukocyte subsets from multi-drug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (MDR-TB), and compare them with nonresistant (NR) TB patients and healthy controls. Methods: 13 MDR-tuberculosis patients, 20 NR-TB individuals and 40 healthy subjects were included. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were double stained with fluorochrome conjugated antibodies against CD56 and CD16 cell surface markers. The phenotype of positive cells was then analyzed by flow cytometry and the percentages of CD56(+) CD16(+), CD56(-) CD16(+), CD56(dim)CD16(+/-), and CD56(bright)CD16(+/-) subsets were calculated. Results: There was a significant decline in the percentage of CD56(+)CD16(+) lymphocytes in both MDR and NR-TB patients compared with healthy controls. We also observed lower proportions of CD56(dim/bright)CD16(+) in addition to higher percentages of CD56(dim/bright)CD16(-) subsets in all TB patients (p <= 0.05). In MDR-TB, our findings demonstrated a distinct phenotypic feature with increased levels of CD56(bright)CD16(-) in comparison with both NR-TB and healthy subjects. Conclusion: Considering the function of CD56/CD16 expressing cells in TB, we suggest that phenotypic characteristics of PBMCs in MDR-TB may correlate with their status of drug resistance and probably with their high mortality rates.

pub-1509	IL-10 and IL-12 Production in Response to Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Total Lipid Antigens in Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipid antigens take part in pathogenicity of the bacterium but the response of monocytes/macrophages to these antigens in tuberculosis is not well known. Objective: The aim of current investigation was to study the M. tuberculosis lipid antigens in tuberculosis pathogenesis. Methods: In the present study M. tuberculosis lipid antigens were extracted. Monocytes and macrophages from multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), TB patients, asymptomatic healthy individuals with positive tuberculin skin test positive and healthy individuals with negative tuberculin skin test were collected using magnetic cell sorting. The cells were stimulated by M. tuberculosis total lipid antigens and IL-12 and IL-10 in their supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The IL-12 production by monocytes in response to M. tuberculosis total sonicate antigens in the MDR-TB patients did not show a considerable difference with the PPD positive healthy subjects, whereas in the active TB patients, IL-12 levels significantly decreased (p<0.05). IL-10 production by monocytes in TB patients in response to total lipid antigens showed a significant increase in comparison to MDR-TB patients and healthy individuals. Conclusion: In the MDR-TB patients, IL-10 and IL-12 production by monocytes in response to M. tuberculosis lipid antigens are similar to the healthy subjects.

10.1089_mdr.2009.0073	Impact of Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis on Treatment Outcome of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients with Standardized Regimen: Report from Iran	The limited experience in treating patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) shows a therapeutic success rate under 50-60% and there are no publications regarding the outcome of these patients treated with standardized regimens. All multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients hospitalized at the Masih Daneshvari Hospital in Tehran, Iran, during 2004-2007 were recruited. Drug susceptibility testing to 14 drugs (including eight second-line drugs) was performed and a standardized regimen with ofloxacin, cycloserine, prothionamide, and amikacin was administered for all patients. Outcome of the patients was studied, comparing between the MDR-TB non-XDR-TB and the XDR-TB. Fifty-one patients were included, 12 with XDR-TB criteria. Of 51, 48 were HIV negative and HIV status was unknown in three cases. All 12 were HIV negative. XDR-TB infection was significantly associated only with age (p = 0.039). The success rates for the total 51 MDR-TB, the 39 MDR-TB non-XDR-TB, and the 12 XDR-TB patients were 76.5% (39 patients), 87.2% (34 patients), and 41.7% (5 patients), respectively. Resistance to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and amikacin were found to be significantly associated with unsuccessful outcome. In this setting, a standardized second-line drugs regimen produces high treatment success rates in MDR-TB patients unless XDR-TB is present.

10.1016_j.trstmh.2009.09.004	Drug susceptibility profile of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from HIV infected and uninfected pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Eastern India	HIV is driving the tuberculosis (TB) epidemic in many developing countries including India. This study was initiated to determine the drug resistance pattern of pulmonary TB among 200 HIV seropositive and 50 HIV negative hospitalized patients from different states of Eastern India. The TB positive isolates (120) were screened and characterized by conventional laboratory methods followed by first- and second-line drug susceptibility testing on Lowenstein-Jensen medium by the proportion method. The drug susceptibility testing showed 17.7% (16/90) and 6.6% (2/30) multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB for the HIV positive and HIV negative patients, respectively. 22.2% (4/18) of the isolated MDR-TB cases could be classified as extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB isolates. 88.8% (16/18) of all the MDR-TB isolates and all XDR-TB isolates were screened from HIV patients. Five (27.7%) of the 18 MDR-TB isolates showed resistance to all the first-line drugs. Mortality rate among the XDR-TB isolates was as high as 75% (3/4). Patients with interrupted anti-TB drug treatment were the ones most affected. These findings are critical and the risk to public health is high, particularly with HIV infected patients.

10.1016_j.tmaid.2009.08.001	Three air travel-related contact investigations associated with infectious tuberculosis, 2007-2008	Background: The potential for transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis during air travel has garnered considerable attention in the media and among public health authorities due to high-profile cases of international travelers with infectious tuberculosis (TB). Methods: During 2007 and 2008, state and local health officials were asked to locate and conduct diagnostic follow-up for airline passengers considered contacts of three travelers, two with multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB and one considered highly contagious, who undertook air travel while infectious with TB disease. Results: Public health departments in 21 states located and evaluated 79 (60%) of the 131 passenger contacts identified; 52 (40%) were lost to follow-up. Eight (10%) contacts had a history of TB disease or latent TB infection and were not retested. Sixteen (23%) of 71 contacts tested had positive TB test results suggesting latent TB infection, 15 of whom were from countries reporting estimated TB disease rates of greater than 200 cases/100,000 persons. Conclusions: Passenger contacts' positive test results may represent prior TB infection acquired in their countries of residence or may be a result of new TB infection resulting from exposure during air travel.

10.1186_1471_2334_10_43	Extensive transmission of isoniazid resistant M. tuberculosis and its association with increased multidrug-resistant TB in two rural counties of eastern China: A molecular epidemiological study	Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular characteristics of isoniazid resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), as well as its contribution to the dissemination of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) in rural areas of eastern China. Methods: A population-based epidemiological study was conducted in two rural counties of eastern China from 2004 to 2005. In total, 131 isoniazid resistant MTB isolates were molecularly characterized by DNA sequencing and genotyped by IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and spoligotyping. Results: The katG315Thr mutation was observed in 74 of 131 isoniazid resistant isolates and more likely to be MDR-TB (48.6%) and have mutations in rpoB gene (47.3%). Spoligotyping identified 80.2% of isoniazid resistant MTB isolates as belonging to the Beijing family. Cluster analysis by genotyping based on IS6110 RFLP, showed that 48.1% isoniazid resistant isolates were grouped into 26 clusters and katG315Thr mutants had a significantly higher clustering proportion compared to those with katG wild type (73%. vs. 18%; OR, 12.70; 95% CI, 6.357-14.80). Thirty-one of the 53 MDR-TB isolates were observed in 19 clusters. Of these clusters, isoniazid resistance in MDR-TB isolates was all due to the katG315Thr mutation; 18 clusters also contained mono-isoniazid resistant and other isoniazid resistant isolates. Conclusions: These results highlighted that isoniazid resistant MTB especially with katG315Thr is likely to be clustered in a community, develop extra resistance to rifampicin and become MDR-TB in Chinese rural settings.

10.1186_1471_2334_10_41	Rapid screening of MDR-TB using molecular Line Probe Assay is feasible in Uganda	Background: About 500 new smear-positive Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases are estimated to occur per year in Uganda. In 2008 in Kampala, MDR-TB prevalence was reported as 1.0% and 12.3% in new and previously treated TB cases respectively. Line probe assays (LPAs) have been recently approved for use in low income settings and can be used to screen smear-positive sputum specimens for resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid in 1-2 days. Methods: We assessed the performance of a commercial line probe assay (Genotype MTBDRplus) for rapid detection of rifampicin and isoniazid resistance directly on smear-positive sputum specimens from 118 previously treated TB patients in a reference laboratory in Kampala, Uganda. Results were compared with MGIT 960 liquid culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST). LPA testing was also performed in parallel in a University laboratory to assess the reproducibility of results. Results: Overall, 95.8% of smear-positive specimens gave interpretable results within 1-2 days using LPA. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 100.0%, 96.1%, 83.3% and 100.0% for detection of rifampicin resistance; 80.8%, 100.0%, 100.0% and 93.0% for detection of isoniazid resistance; and 92.3%, 96.2%, 80.0% and 98.7% for detection of multidrug-resistance compared with conventional results. Reproducibility of LPA results was very high with 98.1% concordance of results between the two laboratories. Conclusions: LPA is an appropriate tool for rapid screening for MDR-TB in Uganda and has the potential to substantially reduce the turnaround time of DST results. Careful attention must be paid to training, supervision and adherence to stringent laboratory protocols to ensure high quality results during routine implementation.

10.5114_aoms.2010.13511	Can immune parameters be used as predictors to distinguish between pulmonary multidrug-resistant and drug-sensitive tuberculosis?	Introduction: Despite the development and wide implementation of Directly Observed Therapy Strategies (DOTS), multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) remains a serious global health threat. In this study, the role of host immune response in patients with MDR-TB is investigated and compared with that of patients with smear-positive drug-sensitive tuberculosis (SP-TB) Material and methods: 27 patients with SP-TB, 20 patients with MDR-TB, and 20 healthy controls were included in the study. Immune parameters were determined by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies in order to compare the percentage values of these markers in the two study groups and the control group Results: The levels of lymphocyte subgroups in the gate of CD45(+)/CD14(-) lymphocyte CD45(+), CD3(+), CD4(+), NK, CD3/HLA-DR, CD 95(+) cells were significantly lower, by contrast CD23(+), CD25(+), CD19(+), CD4(+)/CD8(+), HLA-DR cells were found to be lower, but not significantly so in patients with MDR-TB, compared to levels in patients in the SP-TB and control groups Besides these findings, the levels of NKT cells and gamma delta TCR(+) cells were significantly higher in the MDR-TB than in the healthy control and SP-TB group Conclusions: The lower levels of CD3/FILA-DR, CD4 (+), Fas (+), and NK, and the higher level of NKT together with T cells in patients with MDR-TB compared to those in SP-TB may indicate a profound immune suppression in MDR-TB patients and thereby may denote an accumulation in the bacterial load Our findings may shed light on the pathogenesis and prognosis of MDR tuberculosis, and may point towards the use of flow cytometry findings as an aid to early diagnosis in MDR-TB patients.

10.3201_eid02l0.090968	Emergence of Increased Resistance and Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Despite Treatment Adherence, South Africa	We investigated the emergence and evolution of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in an HIV co-infected population at a South African gold mine with a well-functioning TB control program. Of 128 patients with drug-resistant TB diagnosed during January 2003-November 2005, a total of 77 had multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB, 26 had pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB), and 5 had XDR TB. Genotyping suggested ongoing transmission of drug-resistant TB, and contact tracing among case-patients in the largest cluster demonstrated multiple possible points of contact. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated stepwise evolution of drug resistance, despite stringent treatment adherence. These findings suggested that existing TB control measures were inadequate to control the spread of drug-resistant TB in this HIV co-infected population. Diagnosis delay and inappropriate therapy facilitated disease transmission and drug-resistance. These data call for improved infection control measures, implementation of rapid diagnostics, enhanced active screening strategies, and pharmacokinetic studies to determine optimal dosages and treatment regimens.

pub-1518	Diagnosis of drug-resistant tuberculosis: reliability and rapidity of detection	With the emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), the need for rapid drug susceptibility testing (DST) is felt globally. National tuberculosis control programmes (NTPs) may find it hard to choose from the bewildering variety of rapid tests. We give an overview of the most important methods, discussing their merits and shortcomings, emphasising techniques that offer an alternative to the commercial systems and genotypic tests. Correlation between phenotypic and genotypic DST remains problematic due to our insufficient knowledge of the mutations underlying drug resistance, besides the past standardisation of phenotypic DST. Rapid growth-based DST tends to be less accurate due to growth retardation of some resistant strains. To arrive at optimal resistance monitoring and management of MDR-TB without overloading the laboratories, the test indications and definition of a suspect need careful consideration, while excellent microscopy remains crucial but challenging. The hitherto little-studied fluorescein diacetate vital staining technique may offer the solution, reconciling earlier detection and appropriate pre-selection for rapid DST. For the choice of methods, appropriateness and sustainability should be considered in conjunction with the prospects for complete population coverage. Excellent coverage will only be feasible through decentralisation of simple, low-requirement methods or alternatively by centralised genotypic DST with, in principle, easy specimen referral. The small differences in DST turnover time are relatively unimportant, provided primary culture isolation is not required. No test is fully accurate, and proper pre-selection may allow the use of less accurate but simple screening methods. Conventional slow DST will still be needed for confirmation and for epidemiological monitoring.	tuberculosis; rifampicin; isoniazid; resistance; rapid drug susceptibility testing	LINE PROBE ASSAY; NITRATE REDUCTASE ASSAY; GROWTH INDICATOR TUBE; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; RIFAMPICIN RESISTANCE; CLINICAL SPECIMENS; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE; SENSITIVITY TESTS; MICROSCOPIC-OBSERVATION; ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE
pub-1519	Genetic characterisation of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in rural China: a population-based study	OBJECTIVES: A population-based study was performed to characterise the genotype and phenotype of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in the year 2004-2005 in two Chinese rural counties with different durations of DOTS implementation, Deqing and Guanyun. METHODS: Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains were isolated from respectively 164 and 187 patients registered at local TB dispensaries of Deqing and Guanyun. Drug susceptibility profiling and DNA sequencing were performed on the isolates. RESULTS: A total of 223 isolates from 223 patients were identified as resistant to first-line drugs, of which 53 were multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB, i.e., resistant to isoniazid [INH] and rifampicin [RMP]). Mutations in katG were identified in 81 of 131 INH-resistant isolates (61.8%), all of which harboured the mutation in codon 315. Mutations related to RMP resistance occurred mostly in codon 531, 526 and 516 of the rpoB gene. Seventy-eight of the 115 streptomycin-resistant isolates carried a mutation in the rpsL gene at codon 43 or 88. A mutation in codon 306 of embB occurred in 21 ethambutol (EMB) resistant and 19 EMB-susceptible isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that DNA sequencing of specific codons of the rpoB gene should be effective for predicting RMP resistance and MDR-TB in rural China.

pub-1520	First- and second-line drug resistance patterns among previously treated tuberculosis patients in India	Culture and drug susceptibility testing results of 2816 tuberculosis (TB) patients from across India who had failed repeated treatments from 2001 to 2004 were retrospectively analysed at the Tuberculosis Research Centre, Chennai. Of 1498 (53%) identified as having multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), 671 (44.8%) were resistant to >= 1 second-line drugs (SLDs): 490 (32.7%) to ethionamide, 245 (1.6.4%) to ofloxacin and 169 (11.3%) to kanamycin; 69 (4.6%) were extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). Although from a highly select and non-representative patient group, such high SLD resistance levels, including XDR-TB, among MDR-TB patients is of concern. The prevention of MDR/XDR-TB through quality DOTS services, however, remains the priority. In addition, rapid scale-up of quality programmatic management under the RNTCP is needed, with more control and rational use of SLDs outside the programme.	drug resistance; previously treated tuberculosis; India	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; TB
10.1093_jac_dkp452	Genetic analysis of extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in Lisbon, Portugal	Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) threatens the global control of TB worldwide. Lisbon has a high XDR-TB rate [50% of the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)], which is mainly associated with Lisboa family strains. Few studies have addressed the identification of mutations associated with resistance to second-line injectable drugs, and the relative frequency of such mutations varies geographically. The aim of this study was to characterize the genetic changes associated with the high number of XDR-TB cases in Lisbon. In the present study we analysed 26 XDR-TB clinical isolates. The gyrA, tlyA and rrs genes were screened for mutations that could be responsible for resistance to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs. Moreover, the strains under analysis were also genotyped by MIRU-VNTR ('mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number of tandem repeats'). The mutational analysis identified the most frequent mutations in the resistance-associated genes: S91P in gyrA (42.3%); A1401G in rrs (30.8%); and Ins755GT in tlyA (42.3%). The occurrence of mutations in rrs was associated with the non-occurrence of mutations in tlyA. The genotypic analysis revealed that the strains were highly clonal, belonging to one of two MIRU-VNTR clusters, with the largest belonging to the Lisboa family. Association between mutations in gyrA and rrs or tlyA was verified. The association of specific mutations highlighted the strains' high clonality and indicates recent XDR-TB transmission. In addition, the identification of the most frequent resistance-associated mutations will be invaluable in applying XDR-TB molecular detection tests in the region in the near future.

pub-1522	Drug-susceptibility Patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa: Possible Guiding Design of Retreatment Regimen	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has been a cause of concern in both developed and developing countries. The prevalence of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates (n=692) from Mpumalanga province was assessed. In total, 692 (64%) MTB strains from cases with pulmonary TB were tested for susceptibility against rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and streptomycin using the MGIT 960 instrument. Two hundred and nine (30.2%) strains were resistant to one or more drugs. Resistance to one drug ranged from 1.4% for ethambutol to 17.7% for rifampicin. The prevalence of MDR-TB ranged from 6.7% for three drugs to 34% for four drugs, with significant predictors being patients' age-groups of 25-54 years (p=0.0012) and >55 years (p=0.007). The result showed a high level (58.4%) of MDR-TB from cases in Mpumalanga province. To achieve a higher cure rate in this province, drug-susceptibility tests must be done for every case.

10.1086_649900	Re-emergence of the Progenitors of a Multidrug-Resistant Outbreak Strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis among the Post-Outbreak Case Patients	Background. The progenitors of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) outbreak strains might evolve into new outbreak strains. We hypothesized that these strains could re-emerge among post-outbreak patients with TB and must thus be tracked. Methods. To identify the progenitors of the outbreak strain, we first determined the precise IS6110 genomic insertion locations of a Haarlem3 strain that caused a severe MDR-TB outbreak in Tunisia. Next, we searched by polymerase chain reaction for these outbreak-specific IS6110 transposition sites in all the Haarlem3 post-outbreak isolates recovered in the epidemic region. Results. By analyzing the distribution of the outbreak-specific IS6110 transposition sites, we were able to trap, among isolates recovered from post-outbreak new patients, drug-susceptible and drug-resistant isolates that are likely to represent the very close progenitors of the outbreak strain. Mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeats typing and sequential accumulation of rifampicin resistance-associated rpoB mutations further confirmed the identity of the outbreak's progenitor strains. Conclusions. The data of the current study show that the progenitors of an MDR-TB outbreak strain could re-emerge among post-outbreak TB cases. We provide an IS6110 insertion site-based approach to better trace back the events preceding the emergence of MDR-TB outbreaks, irrespective of the availability of a pre-outbreak strain collection.

10.1590_S0074_02762010000100006	Antimycobacterial neolignans isolated from Aristolochia taliscana	Tuberculosis (TB - Mycobacterium tuberculosis) is an ancient infectious disease that has appeared once again as a serious worldwide health problem and now comprises the second leading cause of death resulting from a single infection. The prevalence of multidrug resistance (MDR) TB is increasing and therapeutic options for treatment are not always accessible; in fact, some patients do not respond to the available drugs. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel anti-TB agents. The aim of the present study was to screen extracts of Aristolochia taliscana, a plant used in traditional Mexican medicine to treat cough and snake bites, for antimycobacterial activity. The hexanic extract of A. taliscana was tested by microdilution alamar blue assay against Mycobacterium strains and bioguided fractionation led to the isolation of the neolignans licarin A, licarin B and eupomatenoid-7, all of which had antimycobacterial activity. Licarin A was the most active compound, with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 3.12-12.5 mu g/mL against the following M. tuberculosis strains: H37Rv, four mono-resistant H37Rv variants and 12 clinical MDR isolates, as well as against five non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) strains. In conclusion, licarin A represents a potentially active anti-TB agent to treat MDR M. tuberculosis and NTM strains.	antimycobacterial neolignans; A. taliscana; M. tuberculosis H37Rv; MDR M. tuberculosis; non-tuberculous mycobacteria	MACHILUS-THUNBERGII; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS; RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; CYTOTOXIC NEOLIGNANS; ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS; MEXICAN-PLANTS; IN-VITRO; LIGNANS; TOXICITY
10.1097_FTD.0b013e3181cc6d6f	Limited Sampling Strategies for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Linezolid in Patients With Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Introduction: Linezolid is a potential drug for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis but its use is limited because of severe adverse effects such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and peripheral neuropathy. This study aimed to develop a model for the prediction of linezolid area. under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC(0-12h)) by limited sampling strategy to enable individualized dosing. Patients and Methods: Fourteen patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis received linezolid twice daily as part of their antituberculosis treatment. Linezolid concentrations were determined at steady state by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry before and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours after dosing. Linezolid AUC(0-12h) population model and limited sampling models were calculated with MWPharm software. The correlation between predicted linezolid AUC(0-12h) and observed linezolid AUC(0-12h) was investigated by Bland-Altman analysis. Results: A total of 26 pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained. The median AUC(0-12h) was 51.8 (interquartile range, 41.8-65.9) mg*h/L at 300 mg and 123.8 (interquartile range, 100.9-152.5) mg*h/L at 600 mg, both twice daily. The most relevant model clinically for prediction of linezolid AUC(0-12h) used a linezolid trough concentration (r = 0.91, prediction bias = -2.9% and root mean square error = 15%). Discussion: The difference between choosing a trough concentration and two to three samples increased the correlation from 0.90 to 0.95 but appeared not clinically relevant because it did not result in different dosing advice. Conclusion: This study showed that linezolid AUC(0-12h) in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis could be predicted accurately by a minimal sampling strategy and could be used to individualize the dose.

10.1164_rccm.200907_0989OC	HIV Coinfection in Multidrug- and Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Results in High Early Mortality	Rationale: The multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) epidemics are rapidly expanding in South Africa. Our initial report of HIV-associated XDR TB in South Africa revealed rapid and near complete mortality. Lower mortality has been described in the literature, but few of these patients have been HIV coinfected. Objectives: To characterize mortality from MDR and XDR TB in a setting with high HIV-coinfection rates. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study among 654 MDR and XDR TB cases diagnosed in Tugela Ferry, South Africa, from 2005 to 2007. Demographics and HIV status were abstracted from available medical records. Measurements and Main Results: Survival was determined from the date of sputum collection until October 2008 and correlated with year of diagnosis and drug-susceptibility test results. From 2005 to 2007, 272 MDR TB and 382 XDR TB cases were diagnosed; HIV-coinfection rates were 90 and 98%, respectively. One-year mortality was 71% for MDR and 83% for XDR TB patients; 40% of MDR TB and 51% of XDR TB cases died within 30 days of sputum collection. One-year mortality among both MDR and XDR TB patients improved from 2005 to 2007; however, the majority of deaths still occurred within the first 30 days. One-year and 30-day mortality rates were worse with greater degree of drug resistance (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Mortality from MDR and XDR TB in this high HIV-prevalence region is extraordinarily high, particularly within the first 30 days. Efforts to reduce mortality must focus on earlier diagnosis and early initiation of second-line TB and antiretroviral therapy.

10.1086_648675	Linezolid in the Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Background. Linezolid is a new antibiotic with activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro and in animal studies. Several small case series suggest that linezolid is poorly tolerated because of the side effects of anemia/thrombocytopenia and peripheral neuropathy. To characterize our clinical experience with linezolid, the California Department of Public Health Tuberculosis Control Branch's Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Service reviewed cases in which the MDR-TB treatment regimens included linezolid therapy. Methods. Record review was performed for 30 patients treated with linezolid as part of an MDR-TB regimen. Data were collected on clinical and microbiological characteristics, linezolid tolerability, and treatment outcomes. The dosage of linezolid was 600 mg daily. Vitamin B6 at a dosage of 50-100 mg daily was used to mitigate hematologic toxicity. Results. During 2003-2007, 30 patients received linezolid for the treatment of MDR-TB. Patients had isolates resistant to a median of 5 drugs (range, 2-13 drugs). Of the 30 cases, 29 (97%) were pulmonary; of these 29, 21 (72%) had positive results of acid-fast bacilli smear, and 16 (55%) were cavitary. Culture conversion occurred in all pulmonary cases at a median of 7 weeks. At data censure (31 December 2008), 22 (73%) of 30 patients had successfully completed treatment. Five continued to receive treatment. There were no deaths. Three patients had a poor outcome, including 2 defaults and 1 treatment failure. Side effects occurred in 9 patients, including peripheral and optic neuropathy, anemia/thrombocytopenia, rash, and diarrhea. However, only 3 patients stopped linezolid treatment because of side effects. Conclusions. Linezolid was well tolerated, had low rates of discontinuation, and may have efficacy in the treatment of MDR-TB.

10.2165_11532080_000000000_00000	Comparison of the Pharmacokinetics of Two Dosage Regimens of Linezolid in Multidrug-Resistant and Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients	Background and Objectives: For the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB), potent new drugs are urgently needed. Linezolid is a promising drug, but its use is limited by adverse effects with prolonged administration of 600 mg twice daily. In order to reduce its adverse effects and maintain efficacy, we investigated whether linezolid in a reduced dosage resulted in drug serum concentrations exceeding a ratio of the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) over 24 hours (AUC(24)) [AUC(24)/MIC] of >100. Patients and Methods: This open-label, prospective pharmacokinetic study evaluated two doses (300 and 600 mg) of linezolid in MDR-TB patients, who received linezolid as part of their treatment. They received linezolid 300 mg twice daily for 3 days, followed by 600 mg twice daily. Blood samples taken at predefined intervals for measuring serum linezolid concentrations were processed by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry procedure. The AUC(24)/MIC ratio was used as a predictive model of efficacy. Adverse effects of linezolid, including peripheral neuropathy, were evaluated by clinical and laboratory assessments. Results: Eight patients were included in this study. The median duration of linezolid treatment was 56 days (interquartile range [IQR 44-82] days), with a median cumulative dose of 51 000 mg (IQR 33 850-60 450 mg). The median linezolid AUC over 12 hours (AUCI,) values were 57.6 mg . h/L (IQR 38.5-64.2 mg . h/L) with the 300 mg dose and 145.8 mg . h/L (IQR 101.2-160.9 mg . h/L) with the 600 mg dose. The AUC(24)/MIC ratios were 452 (IQR 343-513) with the 300 mg dose and 1151 (IQR 656-1500) with the 600 mg dose. Linezolid was well tolerated. Conclusion: Seemingly effective serum concentrations were reached after 3 days of administration of linezolid 300 mg twice daily, i.e. the AUC(24)/MIC ratio was at least 100 in 7 of 8 patients. Larger numbers of patients should be studied to confirm the efficacy of the linezolid 300 mg twice-daily dosage in MDR-TB or XDR-TB treatment.

10.4103_0255_0857.58725	The use of E-test for the drug susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis - A solution or an illusion	Aim: To evaluate E-test as a tool for rapid determination of drug susceptibility against the conventional LJ method focusing on reliability, expense, ease of standardization and performance of the technique in low resource settings. Materials and Methods: A total of 74 clinical isolates (2004-2005) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were tested using E-test for susceptibility to streptomycin (STM), isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF) and ethambutol (EMB) by E-strip and LJ (LJPM) proportion methods. Results: The LJPM method, the gold standard, detected resistance against STM in 16.2, INH in 40.5, RIF in 18.9 and EMB in 27 cases. In comparison, the resistance values showed by E-test was 66.67 for STM, 57.14 for INH 71.43 for RIF and 80 for EMB. The susceptible correlation was 90.32 for STM, 73.91 for INH, 93.33 for RIF and 59.26 for EMB. E-test correctly identified only eight of the 12 (66.6) MDR isolates and wrongly identified four isolates which were not MDR. The overall agreement between the two methods was only 48.6. Resistant isolates showed false positive resistance observed while using E-strip towards all the drugs. Conclusion: E-strips are not quite feasible as a replacement for LJ-proportion method on a large scale due to high risk of cross contamination, laboratory infection, expense associated with it and high false positive resistance observed to all first line drugs. However, the good correlation observed for RIF between the two methods indicates that E-test could contribute to the role in rapid screening of MDR TB isolates as rifampicin mutations are invariably observed in MDR TB isolates.

pub-1532	Drug-resistant tuberculosis in six hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil	SETTING: Tuberculosis (TB) drug resistance survey in six hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. OBJECTIVE: To estimate resistance to at least one drug (DR) and multidrug resistance (MDR) and identify associated factors. DESIGN: One-year cross-sectional survey. Hospitals were included as a convenience sample. RESULTS: Of 595 patients investigated, 156 (26.2%) had previously undergone anti-tuberculosis treatment, 433 (72.8%) were not previously treated and information on the remaining 6 was not available. Overall, DR and MDR rates were high, at respectively 102 (17.1%, 95%CI 14.3-20.5) and 44 (7.4%, 95%CI 5.5-9.9) cases. Among individuals not previously treated, 17 had MDR (3.9%, 95%CI 2.4-6.3) and diagnosis in a TB reference hospital was independently associated with MDR (prevalence ratio [PR] 3.3, 95%CI 1.2-8.7) after multivariate analysis. Among previously treated individuals, 27 had MDR (17.3%, 95%CI 11.7-24.2). MDR-TB was independently associated with diagnosis in a TB reference hospital (PR 3.6, 95%CI 1.5-8.7), male sex (PR 2.3,95%CI 1.2-4.4) and dyspnoea (PR 0.3, 95%CI 0.1-0.7). CONCLUSION: We found high levels of DR- and MDR-TB. Our study design did not permit us to determine the contribution of community versus nosocomial transmission. Further studies are needed to establish this. Nevertheless, hospitals should be recognised as a potential source of transmission of resistant TB strains and urgent measures to avoid nosocomial TB transmission should be taken.

pub-1533	Multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis in Los Altos, Selva and Norte regions, Chiapas, Mexico	OBJECTIVES: To analyse the proportion of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in cultures performed during the period 2000-2002 in Los Altos, Selva and Norte regions, Chiapas, Mexico, and to analyse MDR-TB in terms of clinical and sociodemographic indicators. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) from the above regions. Drug susceptibility testing results from two research projects were analysed, as were those of routine sputum samples sent in by health personnel for processing (n = 114). MDR-TB was analysed in terms of the various variables of interest using bivariate tests of association and logistic regression. RESULTS: The proportion of primary MDR-TB was 4.6% (2 of 43), that of secondary MDR-TB was 29.2% (7/24), while among those whose history of treatment was unknown the proportion was 14.3% (3/21). According to the logistic regression model, the variables most highly associated with MDR-TB were as follows: having received anti-tuberculosis treatment previously, cough of >3 years' duration and not being indigenous. CONCLUSIONS: The high proportion of MDR cases found in the regions studied shows that it is necessary to significantly improve the control and surveillance of PTB.	indigenous population; Mexico; tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; pulmonary	
pub-1534	An interesting case of rifampicin-dependent/-enhanced multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	We report a case of rifampicin (RMP) dependent/enhanced multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) from a patient who had been treated with the World Health Organization optional thrice-weekly treatment and document the clinical and bacteriological features. RMP-enhanced tubercle bacilli that grew poorly without RMP but grew better in its presence were isolated from the patient with treatment failure. The bacteria grown without RMP consisted of mixed morphologies of short rod-shaped acid-fast bacteria and poorly stained coccoid bacteria, but stained normally as acid-fast rods when grown in the presence of RMP. The isolated RMP-enhanced bacteria harbored the common S531L mutation and a novel mutation F584S in the rpoB gene. Treatment containing RMP or replacement of RMP with more powerful rifapentine paradoxically aggravated the disease, but its removal led to successful cure of the patient. This study highlights the potential dangers of continued treatment of MDR-TB with rifamycins that can occur due to delayed or absent drug susceptibility results and calls for timely detection of RMP-dependent/-enhanced bacteria in treatment failure patients by including RMP in culture media and removal of RMP from treatment regimen upon detection.	rifampicin dependency/enhancement; treatment failure; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	
pub-1535	Experience establishing tuberculosis laboratory capacity in a developing country setting	OBJECTIVE: To describe the experience of strengthening laboratory diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in a resource-limited country with high TB-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) prevalence. METHODS: In the Kingdom of Lesotho, which is confronted with high levels of TB, MDR-TB and HIV prevalence, between 2006 and 2008 a coalition of the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, Partners In Health and the World Health Organization renovated the National TB Reference Laboratory and reinforced microscopy services, streamlined conventional culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) and introduced modern TB diagnostic methods. FINDINGS: It was feasible to establish a biosafety level three facility for solid culture and DST and an external quality assessment programme for smear microscopy within 4 months, all in 2007. Liquid culture and DST were introduced a month later. Preliminary results were comparable to those found in laboratories in industrialised countries. A year later, line-probe assay for the rapid detection of MDR-TB was introduced. DISCUSSION: Through strong political commitment and collaboration, it is possible to rapidly establish quality assured TB diagnostic capacity, including current methods, in a resource-limited setting. Case detection and management for TB and MDR-TB have been greatly enhanced. From a low baseline, TB culture throughput in the laboratory increased ten-fold and has been sustained. This experience has served as a catalyst to translate policy into practice with new diagnostic technologies. It supports global policy setting to enhance and modernise laboratory work in developing countries.	TB laboratory capacity; liquid culture; line-probe assay; MDR-TB; low-income country	
pub-1536	Multidrug-Resistant and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis in Kashmir, India	Background: To study the profile of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in tertiary care hospital setting, representing almost the whole affected population in Kashmir valley of India. Methodology: A total of 910 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were enrolled over four years. Among these, cases of MDR-TB and XDR-TB were meticulously studied for drug susceptibility, treatment, adverse effects profile and overall survival. Results: Fifty-two (5.7%) cases of MDR-TB were identified, among which eight (15.3%) were diagnosed as XDR-TB on the basis of drug susceptibility testing, using the prescribed definition. The cases were sensitive to 2, 3, 4, 5 and more than 5 drugs in almost equal proportions. Thirty-seven (71.1%) cases were successfully cured; eleven (21.1%) patients died; and only four (7.6%) cases defaulted, indicating overall satisfactory adherence to treatment. Conclusion: For effective treatment of MDR-TB and XDR-TB, early case detection, improved laboratory facilities, availability of appropriate treatment regimens, and financial assistance in resource-limited settings through effective political intervention are necessary for better patient adherence and overall cure.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; extensively drug resistant tuberculosis; drug susceptibility testing	
pub-1537	Risk factors for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Diyarbakir, Turkey	Background: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) is a serious public health problem. This study aimed to investigate probable risk factors for developing MDR in the patients treated for TB at Tuberculosis Control Dispensaries (TCD). Matreial/Method: The records of 34 patients with MDR-TB and 70 patients with TB sensitive to all first-line drugs (DS), who were treated at TCD between January 2002 and December 2008, were reviewed retrospectively in Diyarbakir, Turkey. Results: The mean age was 34.47 +/- 16.99 (32.35 +/- 14.21 in MDR group and 35.50 +/- 18.19 in control group) with the range from 2 to 76 years. Of the patients, 63 were male and 41 were female. When risk factors for MDR were evaluated with univariate analysis methods, low socio-economic status, the presence of accompanying disease, previous TB history, previously administered TB treatment, inappropriate TB treatment, and noncompliance with TB treatment were all found to be significant risk factors. When these risk factors were analyzed with logistic regression analysis, regardless of other risk factors, MDR risk was significantly increased with previous TB history by 22.31, with previously taking TB medication by 13.19, and with low socio-economic status by 6.03. Conclusions: Socio-economic factors also play an important role in this issue. To minimize the effect of patients' risk factors, health workers should be able to reach all patients, and therapies must be given under direct observation.	multidrug-resistant; tuberculosis; risk factors; dispensary	DRUG-RESISTANCE; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; PREDICTORS; TRENDS
pub-1538	RESISTANCE RATES TO MAJOR ANTI-TUBERCULOSIS DRUGS IN MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS STRAINS ISOLATED FROM SEVEN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF TURKEY IN 2003-2006 PERIOD	Multi-drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global problem and has increased especially in areas where tuberculosis control programmes are inefficient. The aim of this study was to detect the resistance rates against isoniazide (INH), rifampisin (RMP), ethambutol (EMB) and streptomycin (SM) in M.tuberculosis strains collected from 7 different regions including 62 cities and sent to Refik Saydam Hygiene Center National Tuberculosis Reference and Research Laboratory. Of the patients included, 7.61% were children, 92.39% were adults; 76.16% were male and 23.84% were female. These strains were isolated from sputum (n = 885, 81.11%), gastric lavage (n = 49, 4.49%), pleural fluid (n = 43, 3.94%), urine (n = 30, 2.74%), bronchoalveolar lavage (n = 22, 2.01%), and other clinical samples (n = 62, 8.46%) such as cerebrospinal fluid, lymph node, abscess material, lung tissue. The susceptibilities of the 1091 M. tuberculosis strains against the major anti-tuberculosis drugs were determined by the proportion method in Lowenstein-Jensen medium. Three hundred ninety two of the isolates were from Central Anatolia, 146 from Black Sea, 419 from Aegean, 28 from Mediterranean, 20 from Marmara, 64 from Eastern Anatolia and 21 from South Eastern Anatolia regions of Turkey. The distribution of the strains according to years were as follows: 88 in 2003, 114 in 2004, 341 in 2005 and 548 in 2006. Resistance to at least one of the drugs tested was found in 264 (14.20%) strains. Overall drug resistance rates to INH, RMP, EMB and SM were 12.3%, 10.1%, 6% and 15.8%, respectively. MDR-TB rate was 10% for this 4 years study period. MDR-TB rate was detected as 13.2%, 9.7%, 10.1% and 9.6% in children, adult, male and female patients, respectively. MDR-TB rate did not exhibit a statistically significant difference in terms of sex, age and study years (p > 0.05). However, this rate showed statistically significant difference in terms of geographical regions (p < 0.05). This study emphasized that regular surveillance of M.tuberculosis resistance to the major anti-tuberculosis drugs will provide valuable data for the effective national control and treatment of tuberculosis.

10.1159_000283687	Association of Antigen-Stimulated Release of Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha in Whole Blood with Response to Chemotherapy in Patients with Pulmonary Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis	Background: We have previously reported that TNF-alpha levels correlate to total mycobacterial burden in tuberculosis (TB) patients. Objective: To characterize the dynamics of cytokine responses in TB patients during chemotherapy to identify potential surrogate markers for effective treatment. Methods: Following induction by culture filtrate proteins in whole blood, production patterns of TNF-alpha, IL-10, IFN-gamma and IL-12 were measured in 23 non-multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB and 16 MDR-TB patients and in 31 healthy controls. Rates of mycobacterial clearance from the sputum were then measured and compared. Results: Prior to the initiation of chemotherapy, TNF-alpha and IL-10 levels were significantly higher in TB patients than in healthy controls while IFN-gamma and IL-12 levels were similar. During chemotherapy, the levels of all 4 cytokines increased. We evaluated these responses separately in patients that did and did not clear their sputum culture at 2 and 6 months. At 2 months, decreases in both IFN-gamma and IL-12 correlated strongly with a successful early response, while after 6 months of therapy, when half (7/14) of MDR-TB patients were still sputum culture positive, downregulation of TNF-alpha was uniquely correlated with sputum conversion between the groups. Conclusion: Our findings suggest the possibility that the regulation of TNF-alpha production in whole blood may be a more specific indicator of sputum conversion at 6 months than IFN-gamma, IL-12 or IL-10 in MDR-TB patients.

pub-1540	TUBERCULOSIS AND MDR-TB IN THE NORTHERN EMIRATES OF UNITED ARAB EMIRATES: A 5-YEAR STUDY	In this study, we describe the prevalence of TB and occurrence of multi-drug-resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in a major referral hospital belonging to the Ministry of Health in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates (UAE). A retrospective review of the clinical and laboratory records of 1,810 Suspected cases of TB was carried out between January 2004 and September 2008. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of each Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate were analyzed. During the study period, 312 M. tuberculosis culture confirmed cases were recorded; 230 were males and 82 were females. The majority of TB cases (36%) were seen among expatriates from South and Southeast Asian Countries. Fifty-one active TB cases (16%) were reported in native people (Emaratis) of the country. The peak age group was between 16 and 45 years. Among first-line antituberculosis drugs, resistance to isoniazid was the most common (21%), followed by streptomycin (14%). MDR-TB was found in 15 cases (4.8%). Although the prevalence of TB in UAE is fairly low, an increasing number of cultures confirmed TB and MDR-TB among native and expatriate patients, necessitating improved vigilance in case detection, effective management and prevention of MDR and XDR-TB emergence in the country.

10.1371_journal.pone.0008313	Ambulatory-Based Standardized Therapy for Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis: Experience from Nepal, 2005-2006	Objective: The aim of this study was to describe treatment outcomes for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) outpatients on a standardized regimen in Nepal. Methodology: Data on pulmonary MDR-TB patients enrolled for treatment in the Green Light Committee-approved National Programme between 15 September 2005 and 15 September 2006 were studied. Standardized regimen was used (8Z-Km-Ofx-Eto-Cs/16Z-Ofx-Eto-Cs) for a maximum of 32 months and follow-up was by smear and culture. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) results were not used to modify the treatment regimen. MDR-TB therapy was delivered in outpatient facilities for the whole course of treatment. Multivariable analysis was used to explain bacteriological cure as a function of sex, age, initial body weight, history of previous treatment and the region of report. Principal Findings: In the first 12-months, 175 laboratory-confirmed MDR-TB cases (62% males) had outcomes reported. Most cases had failed a Category 2 first-line regimen (87%) or a Category 1 regimen (6%), 2% were previously untreated contacts of MDR-TB cases and 5% were unspecified. Cure was reported among 70% of patients (range 38%-93% by Region), 8% died, 5% failed treatment, and 17% defaulted. Unfavorable outcomes were not correlated to the number of resistant drugs at baseline DST. Cases who died had a lower mean body weight than those surviving (40.3 kg vs 47.2 kg, p, 0.05). Default was significantly higher in two regions [Eastern OR = 6.2; 95% CL2.0-18.9; Far West OR = 5.0; 95% CL1.0-24.3]. At logistic regression, cure was inversely associated with body weight,36 kg [Adj. OR = 0.1; 95% CL0.0-0.3; ref. 55-75 kg] and treatment in the Eastern region [Adj. OR = 0.1; 95% CL0.0-0.4; ref. Central region]. Conclusions: The implementation of an ambulatory-based treatment programme for MDR-TB based on a fully standardized regimen can yield high cure rates even in resource-limited settings. The determinants of unfavorable outcome should be investigated thoroughly to maximize likelihood of successful treatment.		PERU; COHORT; HEALTH; LIMA
10.1128_AAC.00851_09	High Level of Cross-Resistance between Kanamycin, Amikacin, and Capreomycin among Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates from Georgia and a Close Relation with Mutations in the rrs Gene	The aminoglycosides kanamycin and amikacin and the macrocyclic peptide capreomycin are key drugs for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The increasing rates of resistance to these drugs and the possible cross-resistance between them are concerns for MDR-TB therapy. Mutations in the 16S rRNA gene (rrs) have been associated with resistance to each of the drugs, and mutations of the tlyA gene, which encodes a putative rRNA methyltransferase, are thought to confer capreomycin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. Studies of possible cross-resistance have shown variable results. In this study, the MICs of these drugs for 145 clinical isolates from Georgia and the sequences of the rrs and tlyA genes of the isolates were determined. Of 78 kanamycin-resistant strains, 9 (11.5%) were susceptible to amikacin and 16 (20.5%) were susceptible to capreomycin. Four strains were resistant to capreomycin but were susceptible to the other drugs, whereas all amikacin-resistant isolates were resistant to kanamycin. Sequencing revealed six types of mutations in the rrs gene (A514C, C517T, A1401G, C1402T, C1443G, T1521C) but no mutations in the tlyA gene. The A514C, C517T, C1443G, and T1521C mutations showed no association with resistance to any of the drugs. The A1401G and C1402T mutations were observed in 65 kanamycin-resistant isolates and the 4 capreomycin-resistant isolates, respectively, whereas none of the susceptible isolates showed either of those mutations. The four mutants with the C1402T mutations showed high levels of resistance to capreomycin but no resistance to kanamycin and amikacin. Detection of the A1401G mutation appeared to be 100% specific for the detection of resistance to kanamycin and amikacin, while the sensitivities reached 85.9% and 94.2%, respectively.

10.1111_j.1469_0691.2009.02760.x	Treatment of cavitary and infiltrating pulmonary tuberculosis with and without the immunomodulator Dzherelo	An open-label, 60-day trial was conducted in 75 newly diagnosed tuberculosis (TB) patients to assess the adjunctive effect of the oral immunomodulator Dzherelo with standard anti-TB chemotherapy (ATT) consisting of izoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and streptomycin (HRZS) administered as directly observed therapy (DOT). Group I (n = 28) with cavitary TB and group 2 (n = 17) with infiltrating pulmonary TB received 50 drops of Dzherelo twice daily in addition to HRZS. Group 3 (n =: 30), which served as a control, received ATT only. Liver damage indicators, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) decreased to normal levels in groups 1 and 2, but increased significantly in group 3. Kidney failure markers, urea and creatinine, normalized in Dzherelo recipients, but were unchanged or worsened in the ATT-only group. The changes in serum lactate dehydrogenase, catalase, malondialdehyde and diene conjugates suggested that Dzherelo downregulates TB-associated inflammation. The anti-inflammatory property of Dzherelo was further supported by a favourable haematology profile, reduced erythrocyte sedimentation rate and faster defervescence. Radiological recovery was significant in both Dzherelo groups, but not in the control group (p = 0.0085, p = 0.025 and p = 0.23, respectively). These findings correlated positively with sputum smear conversion and clinical findings (r = 0.94; p < 0.05). Mycobacterial clearance at day 30 was observed in 77%, 72% and 40% of patients in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. After 2 months sputum conversion rates in groups 1, 2 and 3 were 93%, 89% and 70%, respectively. Sixty-day treatment outcomes in groups 1, 2 and 3 as assessed by improvement in clinical features and respiratory function attained respective p-values of 0.008, 0.25 and 0.72, and 0.013, 0.48 and 0.0015. Dzherelo is thus useful as an immunotherapeutic adjunct in the management of TB.

10.1016_j.ccm.2009.08.015	Multidrug-Resistant and Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in the West. Europe and United States: Epidemiology, Surveillance, and Control	The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and, more recently, of extensively drug resistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a real threat to achieve tuberculosis (TB) control and elimination globally. More than 510,000 new cases of MDR-TB occur each year and XDR-TB cases are recognized in every setting where there has been the capacity to detect them, particularly in Eastern Europe. MDR- and XDR-TB control in Europe and the United States are heavily affected by what happens globally, as the majority of cases occurring in these countries originate in high TB-burden areas of the world. Scaling-up of culture- and drug susceptibility testing capacities and the expanded use of high-technology assays for rapid determination of resistance represent the prerequisites to achieve better control of MDR- and XDR-TB. Most cases with MDR- and XDR-TB in Europe and the United States can be treated successfully if well-designed regimens based on available second- and third-line anti-TB drugs are used and surgical options are carefully considered. Nevertheless, the development of new (more effective and less toxic) drugs to treat patients infected by MDR- and XDR-TB strains with or without active disease are urgently needed. Adherence to internationally agreed standards of care and control practices is imperative to achieve TB control.

10.1016_j.ccm.2009.08.019	Multidrug- and Extensively Drug-resistant Tuberculosis in Africa and South America: Epidemiology, Diagnosis and Management in Adults and Children	Available data show that Africa, together with the Americas and western and central Europe, reported the lowest prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). However, sub-Saharan Africa has a high TB incidence and the highest human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence in the world, and because of the high number of TB cases, Africa still presents 14% of the global burden of new MDR-TB cases. Until recently, Africa and South America were deprived of second-line antituberculosis drugs, preventing the development of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). Current efforts, introducing improved laboratory infrastructure and second-line TB treatment in resource-limited countries, need to be carried out with care to minimize the development of MDR/XDR-TB in these countries. Recent diagnostic developments now need evaluation and implementation in resource-limited areas, and delays in diagnosis also need to be addressed. Outcomes for MDR/XDR-TB have improved, but prevention of MDR/XDR-TB by early diagnosis and treatment, improvement of adherence, and proper infection control remains the mainstay for the future.

10.1016_j.ccm.2009.08.011	Toward an Optimized Therapy for Tuberculosis? Drugs in Clinical Trials and in Preclinical Development	Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be one of the greatest challenges in the global public health arena. Current therapeutic agents against TB are old and inadequate, particularly in the face of many new challenges. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) has become prevalent in many parts of the world and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is rapidly emerging. There are few or essentially no effective drugs available to treat these drug-resistant forms of TB. TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection has become another major problem in areas with high prevalence of HIV infection. Simultaneous treatment of TB and HIV is difficult due to the severe drug-drug interactions between the first-line rifamycin-containing TB therapy and antiretroviral agents. However, there have been some encouraging developments in TB drug research and development within the past decade. At present there are 6 compounds, including 3 novel agents, in late stages of clinical development. There are even larger numbers of compounds and projects in the TB drug pipeline at the discovery stage and in early stages of clinical development, mainly targeting treatment shortening and drug resistance. Despite these encouraging developments, the current TB drug pipeline is not sufficient to address the multitude of challenges inherent in the current standard of TB therapy. A stronger TB drug pipeline and a new paradigm for the development of novel TB drug combinations are needed.

10.1016_j.ccm.2009.08.009	Advances in Immunotherapy for Tuberculosis Treatment	Immunotherapies have the potential to improve the outcome in all patients with tuberculosis (TB) including those with multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB and extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB. Immunotherapy for TB may shorten duration of treatment and reduce pathology in individuals cured by chemotherapy, potentially preventing recurrence. Currently none of the available candidate agents have proof of efficacy for use in MDR-TB or XDR-TB. Further development and evaluation of existing immunotherapeutic agents is required to identify an effective agent that can be used adjunctively with chemotherapy to improve treatment outcomes for drug-susceptible TB, MDR-TB, and XDR-TB. With a range of potential immunotherapeutics, some of which have been produced to good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards and are registered for other indications in humans, the immunotherapy option should no longer be ignored.

pub-1549	Evaluation of the nitrate reductase assay for rapid detection of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis	BACKGROUND: New diagnostic tools are needed to support tuberculosis (TB) control strategies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries with a high prevalence of TB. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the nitrate reductase assay (NRA) for the rapid detection of resistance to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP), as well as to second-line drugs such as ofloxacin (OFX) and kanamycin (KM). DESIGN: To determine diagnostic accuracy, 192 selected clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were used to compare NRA with BACTEC(TM) 460TB for rapid detection of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB strains. RESULTS: A good agreement between NRA and the BACTEC 460TB reference method was observed, with good sensitivity and excellent specificity for INH, RMP and OFX. Results for KM were also promising, although the sensitivity for the detection of KM resistance should be improved. CONCLUSION: NRA is a diagnostic tool of promise for the timely detection of M. tuberculosis resistance to first- and second-line drugs. Our study showed a clear potential for the prompt detection of both MDR- and XDR-TB cases. Further studies are needed to optimise the testing of second-line drugs.

10.1089_mdr.2009.0066	Mycobacterium tuberculosis Genotypic Diversity in Pyrazinamide-Resistant Isolates of Iran	Pyrazinamide (PZA) is an important first-line drug used for the short-course treatment of tuberculosis in combination with isoniazid and rifampin. It has been reported that mutations in pncA gene correlate well with PZA resistance depending on the geographic area. On the other hand, different genotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis show different affinities to acquire resistance-related mutations. To determine the relative significance of various mutations in the pncA gene in Iranian PZA-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates and to analyze the association of different genotypes of M. tuberculosis with PZA resistance, 34 PZA-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates were analyzed for their pncA mutations using direct sequencing. These isolates were genotyped by IS6110 fingerprinting and spoligotyping methods. Mutations in the pncA gene were identified in 24 of 34 of these isolates (70.58%). No mutations were found in 10 PZA-resistant isolates, which implied that alternative mechanisms of resistance existed in these strains. PZA resistance was strongly (41.2%) associated with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Genotyping revealed the Central Asian (CAS) and East-African Indian families as the most prevalent families between PZA-monoresistant isolates versus the Beijing and Haarlem families which were the most frequent families between PZA including multidrug-resistant isolates.

10.1073_pnas.0907925106	Overexpression of the chromosomally encoded aminoglycoside acetyltransferase eis confers kanamycin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) highlights the urgent need to understand the mechanisms of resistance to the drugs used to treat this disease. The aminoglycosides kanamycin and amikacin are important bactericidal drugs used to treat MDR TB, and resistance to one or both of these drugs is a defining characteristic of extensively drug-resistant TB. We identified mutations in the -10 and -35 promoter region of the eis gene, which encodes a previously uncharacterized aminoglycoside acetyltransferase. These mutations led to a 20-180-fold increase in the amount of eis leaderless mRNA transcript, with a corresponding increase in protein expression. Importantly, these promoter mutations conferred resistance to kanamycin [5 mu g/mL < minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) <= 40 mu g/mL] but not to amikacin (MIC <4 mu g/mL). Additionally, 80% of clinical isolates examined in this study that exhibited low-level kanamycin resistance harbored eis promoter mutations. These results have important clinical implications in that clinical isolates determined to be resistant to kanamycin may not be cross-resistant to amikacin, as is often assumed. Molecular detection of eis mutations should distinguish strains resistant to kanamycin and those resistant to kanamycin and amikacin. This may help avoid excluding a potentially effective drug from a treatment regimen for drug-resistant TB.

10.1371_journal.pone.0007954	Outcomes after Chemotherapy with WHO Category II Regimen in a Population with High Prevalence of Drug Resistant Tuberculosis	Standard short course chemotherapy is recommended by the World Health Organization to control tuberculosis worldwide. However, in settings with high drug resistance, first line standard regimens are linked with high treatment failure. We evaluated treatment outcomes after standardized chemotherapy with the WHO recommended category II retreatment regimen in a prison with a high prevalence of drug resistant tuberculosis (TB). A cohort of 233 culture positive TB patients was followed through smear microscopy, culture, drug susceptibility testing and DNA fingerprinting at baseline, after 3 months and at the end of treatment. Overall 172 patients (74%) became culture negative, while 43 (18%) remained positive at the end of treatment. Among those 43 cases, 58% of failures were determined to be due to treatment with an inadequate drug regimen and 42% to either an initial mixed infection or re-infection while under treatment. Overall, drug resistance amplification during treatment occurred in 3.4% of the patient cohort. This study demonstrates that treatment failure is linked to initial drug resistance, that amplification of drug resistance occurs, and that mixed infection and re-infection during standard treatment contribute to treatment failure in confined settings with high prevalence of drug resistance.

10.1016_j.anpedi.2009.07.036	Recommendations of the Spanish Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases (SEIP) on the management of drug-resistant tuberculosis	Drug resistant tuberculosis (TB-R), and in particular, multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global public health problem, as welt as a problem in our country. Cases of TB-R and MDR-TB have increased mainly in HIV, immigrant and socially disadvantaged populations, but a notable increase in the general population has also been observed. This aspect reinforces the need for a systematic study of sensitivity of all the isolates in a reference laboratory to optimally guide the treatment. Children are especially vulnerable to this severe disease due to the limited knowledge of second line anti-tuberculous drugs, in terms of their pharmacokinetic data, optimal doses, or their long term toxicity, all this eventually resulting in the compassionate use of drugs. Another aspect which further complicates the management of R-TB in children is the limited yield of cultures, which frequently leads to clinician designing drug combinations according to the sensitivity of the initial strain. The epidemiological pattern in our country has currently changed. There is a reported increase in isoniazid-resistant strains; therefore, a four drugs regime is mandatory for the initial period in children, until reliable sensitivity results are available. Treatment should be directly observed or at least supervised by paediatricians. The management of latent infections or exposure to a resistant TB case also requires an accurate, strict and prolonged supervision by expert paediatricians. Authorities and health care professionals who deal with TB should be prepared to face this new phenomenon with appropriate measures. The knowledge of second tine drugs for children, as well as mechanisms to ensure the therapeutic adherence and long term control of disease, are essential. (c) 2009 Asociacion Espanola de Pediatria.

pub-1555	Pulmonary rehabilitation in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (TB MDR): a case report	Introduction: In tuberculosis (Tb), the great inflammatory component causes major injuries that trigger fibroblastic reaction, fibrosis and chest wall retraction, compromising pulmonary expansion, which translates into a clinically and functionally moderate restrictive pattern and dyspnea during exercise. This favors lung disability, causing economic and social dependence upon the nuclear family. Measures to control the Tb disease are merely focused on healing; and this fact must be considered insufficient because the actions aimed to habilitation and rehabilitation could prevent or reduce the incidence of Tb by cardiopulmonary disability. The importance of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) as a nonpharmacological treatment in patients with chronic respiratory disease and/or risk factors for acquiring such is documented in the literature, and its application improves the physical condition of the patient and restores health-related quality of life (HRQOL), autonomy, and social integration. Objective: To describe the deterioration of the functionality of a patient with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and that patient's recovery in a PR program. Results: An increase of the distance covered in the six-minute walk test (6MWT) from 240 m to 350 m was observed. Dyspnea score with the medical research council (MRC) improved from 4 to 1, and improved from 7 to 0 with the Borg scale. The upper and lower limb muscle strength increased from 3 to 4. Conclusion: A period of PR of 8 to 10 weeks was enough to improve patient functionality.	Pulmonary rehabilitation; Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; Functionality

Among them, 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-ethyl-3-(thiomorpholin-4-yl)methyl-5-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-pyrrole (2b) proved to be particularly active, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC, expressed as mu g/mL) and a protection index (PI) better than or comparable to those of reference compounds. Also the remaining compounds were very active, although their MIC and PI were in general lower than those of their parent 2-methyl analogues. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

10.1128_IAI.00224_09	Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Display Impaired Th1 Responses and Enhanced Regulatory T-Cell Levels in Response to an Outbreak of Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis M and Ra Strains	In Argentina, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) outbreaks emerged among hospitalized patients with AIDS in the early 1990s and thereafter disseminated to the immunocompetent community. Epidemiological, bacteriological, and genotyping data allowed the identification of certain MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis outbreak strains, such as the so-called strain M of the Haarlem lineage and strain Ra of the Latin America and Mediterranean lineage. In the current study, we evaluated the immune responses induced by strains M and Ra in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with active MDR-TB or fully drug-susceptible tuberculosis (S-TB) and in purified protein derivative-positive healthy controls (group N). Our results demonstrated that strain M was a weaker gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) inducer than H37Rv for group N. Strain M induced the highest interleukin-4 expression in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from MDR-and S-TB patients, along with the lowest cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity in patients and controls. Hence, impairment of CTL activity is a hallmark of strain M and could be an evasion mechanism employed by this strain to avoid the killing of macrophages by M-specific CTL effectors. In addition, MDR-TB patients had an increased proportion of circulating regulatory T cells (Treg cells), and these cells were further expanded upon in vitro M. tuberculosis stimulation. Experimental Treg cell depletion increased IFN-gamma expression and CTL activity in TB patients, with M-and Ra-induced CTL responses remaining low in MDR-TB patients. Altogether, these results suggest that immunity to MDR strains might depend upon a balance between the individual host response and the ability of different M. tuberculosis genotypes to drive Th1 or Th2 profiles.

10.1016_j.ijid.2008.10.006	Molecular identification of mutations associated with anti-tuberculosis drug resistance among strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Background: Understanding the etiologic organism, antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, and transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) can be of great value in optimizing strategies to control and prevent its development and transmission. Methods: One hundred and fifty-five Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in Cairo, Egypt were studied. In vitro drug susceptibility testing against rifampin (RIF), isoniazid (INH), streptomycin (SM), ethambutol (EMB), and pyrazinamide (PZA) was performed. Resistance was studied by the standard agar proportion method. Single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequence analysis were used to detect mutations in the genes that encode resistance to rpoB, katG, rpsL, and embB. Results: Among 155 consecutive M. tuberculosis isolates, 25 (16.1%) were MDR-TB; 13 of these were from newly diagnosed untreated cases, 12 were from re-treated cases, and none of the MDR-TB isolates had matching IS6110 fingerprints. Among the MDR-TB isolates, rpoB mutations were found in 76% of RIF-resistant isolates, katG mutations were found in 47.1% of INH-resistant isolates, rpsL mutations were found in 55.6% of SM-resistant isolates, and embB mutations were found in 36.4% of EMB-resistant isolates. Conclusions: No major differences were found in the frequencies of mutations or types of amino acid substitution between newly diagnosed untreated cases and re-treated cases. The high prevalence of MDR-TB at this hospital underscores the need for continuous monitoring of strains and antimicrobial resistance. (C) 2008 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

10.1097_RCT.0b013e31819877ab	Imaging Findings of Primary Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis: A Comparison With Findings of Drug-Sensitive Tuberculosis	Objective: This study was designed to identify and describe thin-section computed tomographic (CT) findings of primary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) as compared with the findings for drug-sensitive TB. Methods: Between October 2002 and December 2007, thin-section chest CT findings of 39 patients with primary MDR TB and 39 patients with drug-sensitive TB were retrospectively reviewed. The frequency and patterns of lung lesions (including centrilobular nodules, large nodules, consolidation, cavity, fibrotic bands, bronchiectasis, calcification, pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy, number of lobes affected by parenchymal lesions, and laterality) were compared. Statistical comparisons were performed with the use of the chi(2) and the Mann-Whitney U tests for univariate analysis, and a stepwise logistic regression method was used for multivariate analysis. Results: Based on Univariate analysis, bilateral involvement (P < 0.001), segmental or lobar consolidation (P < 0.001), and cavities (P < 0.001) were more frequently seen in primary MDR TB patients. A stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that bilateral involvement of parenchymal lesions (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-15.6; P = 0.012) and multiple cavities (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.5; P = 0.004) were significant CT findings associated with primary MDR TB. Conclusions: The presence of primary MDR TB as detected on a CT scan may help the use of appropriate therapy for infected patients before obtaining a definite diagnosis based on bacteriology.	lung CT; lung diseases; lung infection; mycobacteria	RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS
10.1111_j.1745_7599.2009.00458.x	Multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis: The new face of an old disease	Purpose: To provide an overview of tuberculosis (TB), especially the persistent threat of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR), and the role of the nurse practitioner (NP) in diagnosis, treatment, and public health surveillance. Data sources: Public health sources such as the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control as well as current literature. Conclusions: One hundred twenty-five years after the discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the disease remains a persistent threat and a leading cause of death worldwide. Medication adherence and prevention are critical to successfully treating and ultimately eradicating this killer disease. Healthcare providers need to be knowledgeable in the detection and diagnosis of TB and to understand that they assume responsibility for public health by monitoring treatment adherence and/or appropriate referral. Implications for practice: The persistent and increasing threat of MDR-TB and XDR-TB is a significant public health threat. Healthcare providers need to be knowledgeable and vigilant in diagnosing and treating this disease.	Tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB); extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB)	
pub-1562	MULTI-DRUG RESISTANT TB AND HIV IN THAILAND: OVERLAPPING, BUT NOT INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED RISK FACTORS	The HIV and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) epidemics are closely linked. In Thailand as part of a sentinel surveillance system, we collected data prospectively about pulmonary TB cases treated in public clinics. A subset of HIV-infected TB patients identified through this system had additional data collected for a research study. We conducted multivariate analysis to identify factors associated with MDR-TB. Of 10,428 TB patients, 2,376 (23%) were HIV-infected; 145 had MDR-TB. Of the MDR-TB cases, 52 (37%) were HIV-infected. Independent risk factors for MDR-TB included age 18-29 years old, male sex, and previous TB treatment, but not HIV infection. Among now patients, having an injection drug use history was a risk factor for MDR-TB. Of 539 HIV-infected TB patients in the research Study, MDR-TB was diagnosed. in 19 (4%); the only significant risk factors were previous TB treatment and previous hepatitis. In Thailand, HIV is common among MDR-TB patients, but is not an independent risk factor for MDR-TB Populations at high risk for HIV-young adults, men, injection drug users - should be prioritized for drug susceptibility testing.

10.1111_j.1365_3156.2009.02376.x	Factors associated with death among HIV-uninfected TB patients in Thailand, 2004-2006	OBJECTIVES In countries with both TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemics, HIV is known to be the most powerful risk factor for death during tuberculosis (TB) treatment. Few recent studies have evaluated risk factors for death among HIV-uninfected TB patients in these countries. We analysed data from a multi-province demonstration project in Thailand to answer this question. METHOD We prospectively collected data from HIV-uninfected TB patients treated for TB in four provinces and the national infectious diseases hospital in Thailand from 2004-2006. Standard WHO definitions were used to classify treatment outcomes. We used log-binomial multivariate regression to calculate adjusted relative risk (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for factors associated with death. RESULTS Of 5318 cases, 441 (8%) died during TB treatment. The mean age was 47 years (range 8 months-97 years). Multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB was diagnosed in 62 (1%). In multivariate analysis, patients older than 44 years were significantly more likely to die than patients aged 15-44 years [age 45 64, aRR 2.9 (CI 2.2 -3.8)] [age > 64 years, aRR 5.0 (CI 3.9-6.6)]. Other independent risk factors for death included Thai nationality [aRR 3.9 (CI 1.6-9.5)], MDR-TB [aRR 2.8 (CI 1.7-4.8)], not being married [aRR 1.4 (CI 1.2-1.7)], and living in Chiang Rai province [aRR 2.7 (CI 1.7-4.4)]. CONCLUSIONS The death rate was high among HIV-uninfected TB patients in Thailand. Efforts to improve TB diagnosis and treatment in the elderly and to improve MDR-TB treatment may help reduce mortality.	tuberculosis; HIV-uninfected; Thailand; death	TUBERCULOSIS-RELATED DEATHS; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; RISK-FACTORS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; INFECTED PATIENTS; RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; MORTALITY; SURVIVAL; IMPACT; EPIDEMIOLOGY
10.1021_jm900513a	Synthesis, Biological Evaluation, and Structure-Activity Relationships for 5-[(E)-2-Arylethenyl]-3-isoxazolecarboxylic Acid Alkyl Ester Derivatives as Valuable Antitubercular Chemotypes	Tuberculosis (TB), mostly caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is one of the leading causes of death from infectious disease worldwide. Its coinfection with HIV and the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) strains have further worsened the TB pandemic. Despite its global impact, TB is considered a neglected disease and no new anti-TB therapeutics have been introduced over the last four decades. The nonreplicating persistent form of TB (NRP-TB) is responsible for the length of the treatment and is the putative cause of treatment failure. Therefore, new anti-TB agents, which are active against both the replicating form of Mtb (R-TB) and NRP-TB, are urgently needed. Herein, we report the synthesis and structure-activity relationships (SAR) of a series of 5-[(E)-2-arylethenyl]-3-isoxazolecarboxylic acid alkyl esters as potent anti-TB agents. Several compounds had submicromolar minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against R-TB and were active against NRP-TB in the low micromolar range, thus representing attractive lead compounds for the possible development of new anti-TB agents.

pub-1565	Prevalence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis among patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a retrospective hospital-based study	Background & objective: Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is a difficult-to-treat form of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). High rates of XDR-TB have been reported from India. We sought to ascertain the prevalence of XDR-TB among patients with MDR-TB treated at a tertiary care centre in New Delhi, India. Methods: Case records of patients treated for MDR-TB at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences hospital, New Delhi, between 1997 and 2003 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients underwent a pretreatment drug-susceptibility testing (DST) to first- as well as second-line drugs. XDR-TB was defined as TB caused by bacilli showing resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid in addition to any fluoroquinolone and to at least one of the three following injectable drugs: capreomycin, kanamycin, and amikacin. Results: A total of 211 laboratory-confirmed cases of MDR-TB were reviewed. The mean age of the patients was 33 +/- 12 yr. Fifty one (24%) patients were females. All patients were sero-negative for human immunodeficiency virus infection. Five of the 211 MDR-TB patients had XDR-TB. The prevalence of XDR-TB was 2.4 per cent among MDR-TB patients. Interpretation & conclusion: Our results showed that XDR-TB was rare among patients with MDR-TB treated between 1997 and 2003 at our centre. Unreported selection bias might have been responsible for the high prevalence of XDR-TB reported in previous hospital-based studies from India.

pub-1566	Tuberculosis retreatment category predicts resistance in hospitalized retreatment patients in a high HIV prevalence area	SETTING: Rates of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are currently as high as 7.7% in retreatment cases in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. MDR-TB prevalence is known to be high in patients categorized as treatment failures. Recent reports have questioned the effectiveness of the World Health Organization (WHO) Category 11 regimen in retreatment TB cases. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment category predicts susceptibility patterns and outcomes in a hospitalized population of retreatment TB cases. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort of 197 pulmonary retreatment cases. RESULTS: Retreatment cases treated with the standard retreatment regimen had a high in-hospital mortality (19.8%), or poor outcome (26.4%) and a high rate of MDR-TB (16.2%). The 'treatment failure' category predicted resistance, with 57.1% of patients exhibiting any resistance compared to other treatment categories (P = 0.02); 53.8% of patients with any resistance experienced poor outcomes, compared to 16.6% of pan-susceptible cases (P = 0.02). There was a trend towards poor outcome in the treatment failure category (42.9%, P = 0.13). CONCLUSION: The retreatment category 'treatment failure' is associated with a high prevalence of resistance in an area of high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence. The 'treatment failure' category should be used to identify patients who may benefit from alternative regimens using directed, intensified therapy or second-line agents instead of the current standard retreatment regimen.	retreatment; Category II regimen; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; treatment category; outcome	SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; DRUG-RESISTANCE; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; MANAGEMENT; REGIMEN; THERAPY; FAILURE

OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB). METHODS: Drug susceptibility testing of second-line drugs (ofloxacin, kanamycin, capreomycin, ethionamide, cycloserine and para-aminosalicylic acid) was performed on isolates from multidrug-resistant TB cases from I January to 31 December 2006. RESULTS: In Orel, 16 (21.3%) of 75 tested isolates were XDR-TB; in Vladimir, 9 (4.9%) of 182 isolates were XDR-TB. Bilateral lung involvement was significantly associated with XDR-TB (prevalence ratio = 2.61, 95%CI 1.01-6.72). CONCLUSION: XDR-TB has emerged in Russia. It Is crucial to prevent, diagnose and treat TB and MDR-TB more effectively.	tuberculosis; extensively drug-resistant; second-line drugs; drug susceptibility testing	
10.1371_journal.pone.0007186	Early Outcomes of MDR-TB Treatment in a High HIV-Prevalence Setting in Southern Africa	Background: Little is known about treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in high HIV-prevalence settings such as sub-Saharan Africa. Methodology/Principal Findings: We did a retrospective analysis of early outcomes of the first cohort of patients registered in the Lesotho national MDR-TB program between July 21, 2007 and April 21, 2008. Seventy-six patients were included for analysis. Patient follow-up ended when an outcome was recorded, or on October 21, 2008 for those still on treatment. Fifty-six patients (74%) were infected with HIV; the median CD4 cell count was 184 cells/mu l (range 5-824 cells/mu l). By the end of the follow-up period, study patients had been followed for a median of 252 days (range 12-451 days). Twenty-two patients (29%) had died, and 52 patients (68%) were alive and in treatment. In patients who did not die, culture conversion was documented in 52/54 patients (96%). One patient had defaulted, and one patient had transferred out. Death occurred after a median of 66 days in treatment (range 12-374 days). Conclusions/Significance: In a region where clinicians and program managers are increasingly confronted by drug-resistant tuberculosis, this report provides sobering evidence of the difficulty of MDR-TB treatment in high HIV-prevalence settings. In Lesotho, an innovative community-based treatment model that involved social and nutritional support, twice-daily directly observed treatment and early empiric use of second-line TB drugs was successful in reducing mortality of MDR-TB patients. Further research is urgently needed to improve MDR-TB treatment outcomes in high HIV-prevalence settings.		
10.1371_journal.pone.0007129	An Integrated Approach to Rapid Diagnosis of Tuberculosis and Multidrug Resistance Using Liquid Culture and Molecular Methods in Russia	Objective: To analyse the feasibility, cost and performance of rapid tuberculosis (TB) molecular and culture systems, in a high multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) middle-income region (Samara, Russia) and provide evidence for WHO policy change. Methods: Performance and cost evaluation was conducted to compare the BACTEC (TM) MGIT (TM) 960 system for culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) and molecular systems for TB diagnosis, resistance to isoniazid and rifampin, and MDR TB identification compared to conventional Lowenstein-Jensen culture assays. Findings: 698 consecutive patients (2487 sputum samples) with risk factors for drug-resistant tuberculosis were recruited. Overall M. tuberculosis complex culture positivity rates were 31.6% (787/2487) in MGIT and 27.1% (675/2487) in LJ (90.5% and 83.2% for smear-positive specimens). In total, 809 cultures of M. tuberculosis complex were isolated by any method. Median time to detection was 14 days for MGIT and 36 days for LJ (10 and 33 days for smear positive specimens) and indirect DST in MGIT took 9 days compared to 21 days on LJ. There was good concordance between DST on LJ and MGIT (96.8% for rifampin and 95.6% for isoniazid). Both molecular hybridization assay results correlated well with MGIT DST results, although molecular assays generally yielded higher rates of resistance (by approximately 3% for both isoniazid and rifampin). Conclusion: With effective planning and logistics, the MGIT 960 and molecular based methodologies can be successfully introduced into a reference laboratory setting in a middle incidence country. High rates of MDR TB in the Russian Federation make the introduction of such assays particularly useful.		
pub-1570	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Victoria: a 10-year review	Objective: To describe demographic and clinical characteristics of patients residing in Victoria who were diagnosed with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) during the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2007. Design, setting and patients: Retrospective review of Victorian Department of Health data on laboratory-confirmed cases of MDR-TB for the period 1998-2007. Main outcome measures: Age, sex, country of birth, time between arrival in Australia and notification of TB, residency status, site of disease, and treatment period and outcome. Results: From 1998 to 2007, 31 patients who resided in Victoria were diagnosed with MDR-TB. The median age of patients was 27 years, most patients were born overseas, and more than half were full-time students. The median time between arrival in Australia and notification of TB was 2 years, and 24 patients were notified to the Department within 5 years of arrival. Twenty patients had pulmonary disease; in 12 of these patients, sputum was smear-positive for acid-fast bacilli. The median treatment period for patients who completed treatment was 22 months. Conclusions: The number of patients diagnosed with MDR-TB per year increased during the period 1998-2007. If sustained, this increase will have important implications for public health policy and planning.		IMMIGRANTS; COUNTRIES; DISEASE; STATES; COST
10.1016_j.ejmech.2009.05.010	A facile synthesis and antimycobacterial evaluation of novel spiro-pyrido-pyrrolizines and pyrrolidines	An efficient synthesis of 1-methyl-3-[(E)-arylmethylidene]tetrahydro-4(1H)-pyridinones was achieved by the reaction of 1-methyl-4-piperidone and aromatic aldehydes in the presence of pyrrolidine under solvent-free microwave irradiation. These dipolarophiles upon cycloaddition with nitrile oxide and azomethine ylides afford stereoselectively novel spiro-isoxazolines, pyrrolizines and pyrrolidines respectively in excellent yields. The spiro compounds were screened for their in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (MTB), multi-drug resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and Mycobacterium smegmatis (MC(2)) using agar dilution method. Among the synthesized compounds, 1-methyl-4-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)pyrrolo(spiro[2.3 '']oxindole)spiro[3.3']-1'-methylpiperidin-4'-one was found to be the most active with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1.76 and 0.88 mu M against MTB and MDR-TB respectively.

10.1016_j.ijid.2008.11.027	First-line anti-tuberculosis drug resistance patterns and trends at the national TB referral center in Iran-eight years of surveillance	Objective: Resistance to anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) drugs is becoming a major and alarming threat in most regions worldwide. Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study at a tertiary hospital in Iran, using patient medical records for 2000-2003. The findings were analyzed following the same framework as that used for previous reports from this center. Results: Among 1556 TB patients, drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed for 548 culture-positive cases. Anti-TB drug resistance to both isoniazid and rifampin was identified in 10 (2.8%) of the new TB cases (multidrug-resistant TB; MDR-TB). Any resistance was detected in 228 (41.6%), showing an increasing trend in both new and retreatment cases. The data analysis revealed that drug-resistant TB had a statistically significant association with Afghan ethnicity, age > 65 years, and the type of disease (retreatment vs. new TB case) (p < 0.05). Also, assessment of the drug resistance trends showed a significant increase in resistance to any anti-TB agent, to isoniazid, and to streptomycin in new cases, and to all of the first-line anti-TB drugs in retreatment patients. Conclusions: There has been an increasing trend in drug resistance in recent years, particularly in retreatment cases. Hence, revision of the national TB control program, reevaluation of the role of the World Health Organization category II (CAT II) regimen, as well as the conducting of a nationwide drug resistance survey, are recommended.

pub-1573	Prevalence and risk factors for drug resistance among hospitalized tuberculosis patients in Georgia	BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) control in Georgia follows the World Health Organization-recommended DOTS strategy, and has reached global TB control targets in the treatment of susceptible TB; however, the management of drug-resistant forms of TB still represents a serious problem. A countrywide drug resistance survey (DRS) found that the prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was respectively 6.8% and 27.4% in new and previously treated TB cases. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of and risk factors for drug resistance among TB patients to improve case management and control of drug-resistant TB. METHODS: Extensive social, clinical and bacteriological data were collected from patients hospitalized at the National Centre for Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, Georgia, between 2005 and 2007. RESULTS: Of 605 patients, resistance was observed in 491 (81.2%); MDR-TB was found in 261 (43.1%; 51/222 [23%] new cases and 210/383 [55%] previously treated cases), monoresistant TB in 130 (21.5%), poly-resistant TB in 67 (11.1%) and extensively drug-resistant TB in 33 (5.5%). Female sex, living in the densely populated capital, family TB contact and previous TB treatment were associated with risk of MDR-TB. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the necessity of improving infection control measures and of standardized treatment for drug-resistant TB patients.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB); risk factors; Georgia	
pub-1574	Surveillance of drug-resistant tuberculosis in the state of Gujarat, India	BACKGROUND: Limited information about the prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) has been reported from India, the country with the world's highest burden of TB. We conducted a representative state-wide survey in the state of Gujarat (2005 population: 56 million). METHODS: Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from a representative sample of new and previously treated smear-positive pulmonary TB (PTB) cases were subjected to drug susceptibility testing (DST) against first-line drugs at a World Health Organization supranational reference laboratory. Isolates found to have at least both isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP) resistance (i.e., multidrug-resistant TB [MDR-TB]) were subjected to second-line DST. RESULTS: Of 1571 isolates from new patients, 1236 (78.7%) were susceptible to all first-line drugs, 173 (1.1%) had any INH resistance and MDR-TB was found in 37 (2.4%, 95%CI 1.6-3.1). Of 1047 isolates from previously treated patients, 564 (54%) were susceptible to all first-line drugs, 387 (37%) had any INH resistance and MDR-TB was found in 182 (17.4%, 95%CI 15.0-19.7%). Among 216 MDR-TB isolates, 52 (24%) were ofloxacin (OFX) resistant; seven cases of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) were found, all of whom were previously treated cases. CONCLUSION: MDR-TB prevalence remains low among new TB patients in Gujarat, but is more common among previously treated patients. Among MDR-TB isolates, the alarmingly high prevalence of OFX resistance may threaten the success of the expanding efforts to treat and control MDR-TB.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; India	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; FLUOROQUINOLONE RESISTANCE; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; IMPLEMENTATION; PREVALENCE; TESTS
pub-1575	Pharmacokinetics of prothionamide in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: National Masan Tuberculosis Hospital, Masan, South Korea. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of prothionamide (PTH) in South Korean patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and to investigate whether differences in body mass index (BMI) could explain observed differences in PTH disposition. DESIGN: Seventeen patients participated in the study; all had MDR-TB and had received combination anti-tuberculosis treatment, including PTH, cycloserine, ofloxacin, para-aminosalicylic acid and streptomycin or kanamycin, for at least 2 weeks. The patients were divided into two groups based on BMI: Group A (18.5 <= BMI < 23), and Group B (BMI < 18.5). Serum samples were collected over 24 h, and the plasma PTH concentration was determined by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography assay. RESULTS: After steady-state administration of PTH, the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 12 h (AUC(0-12h)) was 11.0 +/- 3.7 mu g h/ml. The mean T-max and t(1/2) were respectively 3.6 h and 2.7 h. No significant difference in PTH disposition was observed between groups A and B, except for ke and t1/2. CONCLUSION: In the pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for PTH in MDR-TB patients during routine treatment, the pharmacokinetics of PTH did not appear to correlate with extent of emaciation in MDR-TB patients.	prothionamide; MDR-TB; pharmacokinetics	ETHIONAMIDE; LEPROSY; THERAPY; KOREA; SERUM
10.1089_mdr.2009.0906	Risk Factors for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in Four Centers in Burkina Faso, West Africa	This is a case-control study conducted to examine the risk factors for multidrug resistance (MDR) among patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in four centers in Burkina Faso, West Africa: Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso, Gorom-Gorom, and Dori. Fifty-six MDR-TB cases and 304 controls were enrolled of which 40 MDR-TB cases and 222 controls were from Ouagadougou. The majority of cases were male, with 39 among MDR-TB cases and 205 in controls. The MDR-TB cases were aged from 14 to 75 years versus 11 to 75 years in the controls. The total risk assessment battery score was 11. Living outside of Burkina Faso (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.017; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.001-0.325), known TB contact (OR 0.045; 95% CI: 0.004-0.543), and patients with previous history of TB treatment (OR 0.004; 95% CI: 0.000-0.0.052) were significantly associated with MDR-TB. TB contact and mainly previous treatment were the strongest determinants of MDR-TB. Also, living outside Burkina was a risk factor.

pub-1577	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TB AND HIV IN THAILAND: OVERLAPPING, BUT NOT INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED, RISK FACTORS	The HIV and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) epidemics are closely linked. In Thailand as part of a sentinel surveillance system, we collected data prospectively about pulmonary TB cases treated in public clinics. A subset of HIV-infected TB patients identified through this system had additional data collected for a research study. We conducted multivariate analysis to identify factors associated with MDR-TB. Of 10,428 TB patients, 2,376 (23%) were HIV-infected; 145 (1%) had MDR-TB. Of the MDR-TB cases, 52 (37%) were HIV-infected. Independent risk factors for MDR-TB included age 18-29 years old, male sex, and previous TB treatment, but not HIV infection. Among new patients, having an injection drug use history was a risk factor for MDR-TB. Of 539 HIV-infected TB patients in the research study, MDR-TB was diagnosed in 1.9 (4%); the only significant risk factors were previous TB treatment and previous hepatitis. In Thailand, HIV is common among MDR-TB patients, but is not an independent risk factor for MDR-TB. Populations at high risk for HIV-young adults, men, injection drug users - should be prioritized for drug susceptibility testing.

pub-1578	Serum Concentrations of Rifampin, Isoniazid, and Intestinal Absorption, Permeability in Patients with Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis	This study evaluates the serum concentrations of rifampin (RMP), isoniazid (INH), and intestinal barrier function in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), drug susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB). and health volunteers (HC; controls). Peak serum concentrations of RMP were significantly lower in MDR-TB and DS-TB as compared with HC (odds ratio [OR] = 3.125, confidence interval [CI] [1.037-9.418] and OR = 4.025, CI [1.207-13.418], respectively). The INH peak serum concentration was not significantly different between MDR-TB versus DS-TB or DS-TB versus HC. The percent of mannitol excretion was significantly lower in the MDR-TB group compared with DS-TB (13.18 versus 16.03. analysis of covariance [ANCOVA], P = 0.0369) and compared with HC (13.18 versus 16.61, ANCOVA, P = 0.0291) the other study groups. These data suggested a lower peak serum concentration of RMP for both MDR-TB and DS-TB as compared with the HC group. The data also showed a lower intestinal area of absorption in patients with tuberculosis and even worse in MDR-TB.

pub-1579	What's new in TB?	Background Australia has among the world's lowest rates of tuberculosis (TB). However, it remains a leading global cause of morbidity and mortality. In Australia, TB remains more common in Indigenous than non-Indigenous Australians, and rates are rising among migrants, reflecting changing immigration patterns and rising rates in their homelands. Objective This article reviews recent developments in TB of relevance to Australian general practice and provides an update of advances in the diagnosis and management of TB, and the role of the general practitioners in co-managing people with TB. Discussion First hand experience with imported multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TE) is increasing and is anticipated to rise in Australia. The reach of extensively drug resistant TB is also expanding. Although standard guidelines for management of drug susceptible TB remain unchanged, recent progress in the understanding, diagnosis and management of TB has occurred, driven by the need to respond to the challenges of MDR-TB and HIV-TB co-infection.

10.1378_chest.08_2427	Emergence of New Forms of Totally Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Bacilli Super Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis or Totally Drug-Resistant Strains in Iran	Background: The study documented the emergence of new forms of resistant bacilli (totally drug-resistant [TDR] or super extensively drug-resistant [XDR] tuberculosis [TB] strains) among patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Methods: Susceptibility testing against first- and second-line drugs was performed on isolated Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Subsequently, the strains identified as XDR or TDR M tuberculosis were subjected to spoligotyping and variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR). Results: Of 146 MDR-TB strains, 8 XDR isolates (5.4%) and 15 TDR isolates (10.3%) were identified. The remaining strains were either susceptible (67%) or had other resistant patterns (20%). Overall, the median of treatments and drugs previously received by NIDR-TB patients was two courses of therapy of 15 months' duration with five drugs (isoniazid [INH], rifampicin [RF], streptomycin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide). The median of in vitro drug resistance for all studied cases was INH and RF. The XDR or TDR strains were collected from both immigrants (Afghan, 30.4%; Azerbaijani, 8.6%; Iraqi, 4.3%) and Iranian (56.5%) MDR-TB cases. In such cases, the smear and cultures remained positive after 18 months of medium treatment with second-line drugs (ethionamide, para-aminosalicylic acid, cycloserine, ofloxacin, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin). Spoligotyping revealed Haarlem (39.1%), Beijing (21.7%), EAI (21.7%), and CAS (17.3%) superfamilies of M tuberculosis. These superfamilies had different VNTR profiles, which eliminated the recent transmission among MDR-TB cases. Conclusions: The isolation of TDR strains from MDR-TB patients from different regional countries is alarming and underlines the possible dissemination of such strains in Asian countries. Now the next question is how one should control and treat such cases. (CHEST 2009; 136:420-425)		MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; GENETIC DIVERSITY; TB
10.1007_s00586_009_0966_0	Noncontiguous spinal tuberculosis: incidence and management	Tuberculosis (TB) has a worthy reputation as one of the great mimickers in medicine with a multitude of clinical pictures and variations. Noncontiguous spinal TB is described as atypical and case reports are published as rarities in the mainstream academic journals. The aim of the study was to asses the incidence and review of the management of non-contiguous spinal TB. We identified 16 cases of non-contiguous spinal TB from a single surgeon series of 98 patients, who were managed surgically between 2001 and 2006. These were diagnosed on whole spine MRI. This represents the largest series reported in literature to date and is higher than the expected incidence. Case notes and imaging were retrospectively reviewed in an attempt to ascertain if there were any parameters to differentiate this group from the rest of the TB spine population. Our incidence of non-contiguous spinal TB is 16.3%. There was a higher incidence of neurology in the non-contiguous group (75%) compared to the rest of our group (58.5%). Non-contiguous TB was not found to be a manifestation of HIV, MDR TB or of chronicity in our series. Most noncontiguous lesions were evident on plain radiology. Noncontiguous spinal TB is common in areas of high prevalence such as South Africa. Despite being frequently missed initially, noncontiguous involvement is evident on plain radiography and simply requires a higher index of suspicion. When investigating spine TB patients, simple radiology of the entire spine is mandatory. If available, a full spine sagittal MRI is extremely useful in identifying noncontiguous lesions. Treatment of noncontiguous tuberculosis is as for standard spinal TB cases in our unit with similar outcomes, but care needs to be taken in surgical planning as patients may have multiple areas of neurological compromise.

pub-1582	Seven-year DOTS-Plus pilot experience in India: results, constraints and issues	BACKGROUND: India is initiating the DOTS-Plus strategy at the national level. OBJECTIVES: To highlight the results, constraints and issues of a pilot DOTS-Plus experience in an urban setting in India. METHODS: Records of 126 patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) enrolled from January 2002 to December 2006, who received a daily fully supervised standardised treatment regimen under a pilot DOTS-Plus study in India, were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of the 126 patients enrolled, 61% were cured, 19% died, 18% defaulted and 3% failed treatment. There was an average delay of 5 months in the diagnosis of MDR-TB and a subsequent delay of approximately 3.3 months in initiating treatment. Of the 24 patients who died, 29% did so within a month of starting treatment. Migration was the most common reason for default. Cycloserine (CYC) had to be stopped in 15 patients and kanamycin (KM) in five due to major adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: The DOTS-Plus programme in resource-poor settings may provide reasonable results; however, it may confront significant operational difficulties in the timely diagnosis and early initiation of treatment. Early diagnosis and start of treatment may prevent some deaths. Default is commonly due to migration. CYC proved to be the most toxic drug, followed by KM.	multidrug resistance; tuberculosis; DOTS-Plus	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUG-RESISTANCE; SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; TREATMENT FAILURE; OUTCOMES; THERAPY; RISK; PERU
pub-1583	The effect of combined tobramycin-clarithromycin on Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates	This study investigated the susceptibility of 25 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates to tobramycin (TBM) and clarithromycin (CLM). The effect of the drugs administered together was examined for possible synergistic effect. The median minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for both drugs was 8 mu g/ml. In 36% of the isolates, a decrease of the CLM MIC by a single or twofold dilution was observed when a sub-inhibitory concentration of TBM was added. The results suggest that both drugs should be investigated further as potential adjuncts to the treatment of resistant tuberculosis, in particular through new drug delivery systems such as the dry powder inhaler allowing high lung deposition.

10.3346_jkms.2009.24.4.592	Multidrug-resistant Pulmonary Tuberculosis Among Young Korean Soldiers in a Communal Setting	The goal of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of first-line anti-tuberculosis drug resistance and risk factors associated with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) among young soldiers in the Korean military, which has a strict tuberculosis control program. All patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis during their service at the Armed Forces Capital Hospital from January 2001 to December 2006 were enrolled in the study. Drug resistant Mycobacterium, tuberculosis was isolated from 18 patients (12.2%) and multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis was isolated from 12 patients (8.1%). Previous treatment of tuberculosis and the presence of a cavity on the patient's chest computed tomography scan were associated with MDR TB; military rank, smoking habits, and positive acid-fast bacilli smears were not associated with MDR TB. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, previous treatment of tuberculosis was a significant independent risk factor for MDR TB (odds ratio 6.12, 95% confidence interval 1.53-24.46). The prevalence of drug resistant tuberculosis among young soldiers in the Korean military was moderately high and the majority of resistant cases were found in patients who had undergone previous treatment of tuberculosis. Based on our results, we suggest that relapsed tuberculosis cases within communal settings should be cautiously managed until the drug susceptibility tests report is completed, even if previous treatment results were satisfactory.

10.1186_1471_2458_9_243	The whole is greater than the sum of the parts: Recognising missed opportunities for an optimal response to the rapidly maturing TB-HIV co-epidemic in South Africa	"Background: Despite widely acknowledged WHO guidelines for the integration of TB and HIV services, heavily burdened countries have been slow to implement these and thus significant missed opportunities have arisen. Discussion: The individual-centred, rights-based paradigm of the SA National AIDS Policy, remains dissonant with the compelling public-health approach of TB control. The existence of independent and disconnected TB and HIV services results in a wastage of scarce health resources, an increased burden on patients' time and finances, and ignores evidence of patients' preference for an integrated service. The current situation translates into a web of unacceptable, ongoing missed opportunities such as failure to maximize collaborative disease surveillance, VCT, adherence support, infection control, and positive prevention. TB services present a readily identifiable cohort for HIV provider-initiated testing. Integrating HAART and DOTS will promote efficient usage of health workers' time and a more navigable experience for patients, ultimately ensuring increased TB treatment completion rates and MDR-TB prevention. As direct observation evolves into a more supportive, empowering experience for patients, adherence to both TB drugs and HAART will be bolstered. Little attention has been paid to the transmission of TB within HIV services. Low cost infection control interventions include: triaging patients, scheduling new and follow-up patients separately; well-ventilated, sheltered waiting rooms; and the use of personal respirators by patients and staff. A more patient-centred approach to TB care may be able to recruit the active participation of TB patients in positive prevention efforts, including maximizing personal infection control, limiting exposure of social contacts to TB during the intensive phase of treatment, advocating isoniazid prophylaxis within the home and patient-centred education efforts to reduce overall transmission. Several model programmes demonstrated synergy, in which the impact of the ""whole"" or integrated response was greater than the sum of the non-integrated parts. Summary: The full potential of an integrated TB-HIV service has not been fully harvested. Missed opportunities discount existing efforts in both programmes, will perpetuate the burden of disease, and prevent major gains in future interventions. This paper outlines simple, readily-implementable strategies to narrow the gap and reclaim existing missed opportunities."

10.3201_eid1507.080994	Clusters of Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Cases, Europe	Molecular surveillance of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) was implemented in Europe as case reporting in 2005. For all new MDR TB cases detected from January 2003 through June 2007, countries reported case-based epidemiologic data and DNA fingerprint patterns of MDR TB strains when available. International clusters were detected and analyzed. From 2003 through mid-2007 in Europe, 2,494 cases of MDR TB were reported from 24 European countries. Epidemiologic and molecular data were linked for 593 (39%) cases, and 672 insertion sequence 6110 DNA fingerprint patterns were reported from 19 countries. Of these patterns, 288 (43%) belonged to 18 European clusters; 7 clusters (242/288 cases, 84%) were characterized by strains of the Beijing genotype family, including the largest cluster (175/288 cases, 61%). Both clustering and the Beijing genotype were associated with strains originating in eastern European countries. Molecular cluster detection contributes to identification of transmission profile, risk factors, and control measures.

10.1183_09031936.00047208	Adjunctive resectional lung surgery for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis	Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) poses significant management challenges as there are limited pharmacological treatment options for cure. Adjunctive resectional lung surgery decreases case-fatality rates for some patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), but its use has not been well documented for patients with XDR-TB. We describe 17 XDR-TB patients treated with surgery as part of their case management in Latvia during 1999-2005. One patient had no previous TB treatment history, 10 were previously treated for drug-susceptible TB and six were previously treated for MDR-TB. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from the 17 patients were resistant to a mean of 9.2 drugs. Due to failure of pharmacological therapy, one due to a large cavity and one due to pulmonary haemorrhage, 15 patients were treated with surgery. Despite failure of pharmacological treatment in 15 out of 17 patients, eight (47%) were cured with adjunctive surgical treatment. Surgery should be explored as a possible treatment option for patients with XDR-TB.

pub-1588	Radiometric vs. agar proportion methods for assessing ethionamide resistance and its clinical effects in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: Three centres for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Istanbul, Turkey: Heybeliada Centre for Chest Diseases and Thoracic Surgery, Sureyyapasa Centre for Chest Diseases and Thoracic Surgery and Yedikule Centre for Chest Diseases and Thoracic Surgery. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence of ethionamide (ETH) resistance and its effect on time to sputum smear negativity in MDR-TB patients who had not previously received second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. DESIGN: Drug susceptibility testing for isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP), ethambutol, streptomycin and ETH was performed on 50 patients treated between August 2004 and May 2005. Indirect agar proportion and BACTEC methods were used to determine ETH susceptibility. RESULTS: Of the patients who were resistant to at least INH and RMP, 11 (22%) (three [27.3%] new and eight [72.7%] retreatment) were resistant to ETH with the BACTEC method. Of 18 new patients, three (16.6%) were ETH-resistant using the BACTEC method compared to 8/32 (25%) retreatment patients. The mean time to smear negativity was 75.2 days in ETH-resistant patients and 50 days in susceptible patients (P < 0.05). Both ETH-resistant and -susceptible groups were homogeneous for factors that may have a possible effect on time to conversion. CONCLUSION: Not only ETH resistance but also age and radiologically advanced disease adversely affected time to sputum conversion.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; ethionamide; drug resistance; sputum	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; 2ND-LINE; STRAINS; DRUGS
pub-1589	Rapid, accurate determination of multidrug resistance in M-tuberculosis isolates and sputum using a biochip system	OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a rapid biochip system for the determination of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates and clinical sputum samples. DESIGN: We developed a total solution-based system, including a biochip kit, apparatus for sample preparation, hybridisation, washing and data acquisition, and dedicated software for automated diagnosis. The biochip simultaneously identifies M. tuberculosis and detects the most commonly found mutations in the rpoB, katG and inhA genes. The system was assessed with 330 mycobacterial isolates and 129 sputum samples for rifampicin (RMP), and with 205 isolates and 105 sputum samples for isoniazid (INH), and then compared to DNA sequencing and conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST). RESULTS: The entire biochip assay took 6 h. The concordance rate between the biochip assay and the DNA sequencing results was 100%. Compared to conventional DST, the concordance rates were 91.8% for isolates and 94.6% for sputum samples for RMP resistance, and 70.2% for isolates and 78.1% for sputum samples for INH resistance. CONCLUSION: The biochip system provides a simple, rapid, reliable and accurate clinical assay for the parallel detection of M. tuberculosis and prevalent MDR-TB in a 6 h procedure, using either culture isolates or sputum samples for diagnosis.

10.1016_j.tube.2009.04.002	Characteristics of drug-resistant tuberculosis in Abkhazia (Georgia), a high-prevalence area in Eastern Europe	"Although multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem in Eastern Europe, the factors contributing to emergence, spread and containment of MDR-TB are not well defined. Here, we analysed the characteristics of drug-resistant TB in a cross-sectional study in Abkhazia (Georgia) between 2003 and 2005, where standard short-course chemotherapy is supplemented with individualized drug-resistance therapy. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) and molecular typing were carried out for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains from consecutive smear-positive TB patients. Out of 366 patients, 60.4% were resistant to any first-line drugs and 21% had MDR-TB. Overall, 25% of all strains belong to the Beijing genotype, which was found to be strongly associated with the risk of MDR-TB (OR 25.9, 95% CI 10.2-66.0) and transmission (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.6-5.0). One dominant MDR Beijing clone represents 23% of all MDR-TB cases. The level of MDR-TB did not decline during the study period, coinciding with increasing levels of MDR Beijing strains among previously treated cases. Standard chemotherapy plus individualized drug-resistance therapy, guided by conventional DST, might be not sufficient to control MDR-TB in Eastern Europe in light of the spread of ""highly transmissible"" MDR Beijing strains circulating in the community.

pub-1592	Comparison of performance of two DNA line probe assays for rapid detection of multidrug-resistant isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Infections with multidrug-resistant (resistant at least to rifampicin, RIF and isoniazid, INH) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are associated with high case fatality rates. Rapid identification of MDR-TB strains is important for early institution of appropriate therapy. Two DNA line probe assays, GenoType MTBDR (GT-MTBDR) and INNO-LiPA Rif. TB (INNO-LiPA) were compared for their abilities to detect resistance to INH and RIF in 80 M. tuberculosis isolates. The test results were compared to those obtained by conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST), DNA sequencing and/or PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of regions of interest of M. tuberculosis genome. Compared to the DST and katG codon 315 PCR-RFLP results, GT-MTBDR test results were concordant for INH resistance for 63 of 80 (78.7%) isolates. For RIF resistance, GT-MTBDR and INNO-LiPA test results were concordant with DST for 74 of 80 (92.5%) and 76 of 80 (95%) strains, respectively. The GT-MTBDR test results correlated with sequencing results for 77 of 80 (96.2%) while LNNO-LiPA results for 79 of 80 (98.7%) isolates. Both the tests are useful for rapid detection of MDR-TB strains, however, GT-MTBDR assay offers the advantage of detecting the resistance to both INH and RIF simultaneously when MDR-TB is suspected.

pub-1593	Cross-resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates among streptomycin, kanamycin and amikacin	Seventy-four streptomycin (SM)-resistant M. tuberculosis clinical isolates were subjected to cross-resistance drug testing against two major aminoglycosides, kanamycin (KM) and amikacin (AMK). Among them, 15 clinical isolates (20.3%) were resistant to both KM and AMK. Fifteen (80%) of 19 KM-resistant isolates were AMK-resistant. Fifteen SM, KM, and AMK resistant isolates harbored rrs mutation, but only two had rrs and rpsL double mutations. Low-level SM resistance was associated with rpsL mutation, whereas high-level SM resistance was linked to rrs mutation.	Amikacin; Cross-resistance; Kanamycin; MDR-TB; Streptomycin	CHINA; GENE
pub-1594	The Treatment Outcome of Multi Drug Resistant Tuberculosis in a Teaching Hospital	Objective: Multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is becoming a serious public health problem worldwide and have low rates of treatment response, high mortality and morbidity. The present study intends to assess the extent of this problem among tuberculosis patients attending hospital. Design: This is cross sectional study of the tuberculosis patients attending in a teaching hospital. Material and Methods: Suspected TB patients attending hospital were assessed in detail. Overall 1487 TB patients were identified and assessed further by detailed history taking, clinical pathological and radiological evaluation. Culture and sensitivity for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was done by BACTEC 460 radiometric method from sputum of patient with irregular treatment, inadequate treatment, and treatment failure cases. Treatment was given to the MDR-TB (31 in our study) patients and their outcomes were assessed. Results: Between January 2003 to January 2008, 31 MDR-TB patients were treated. Mean number of drugs to which resistance developed was 4.68 (Std dev 1.904). Successful outcome was seen in 64.51%, relapse was in 12.90%, treatment failure was in 19.35%. Overall unsuccessful outcome was seen in 35.48%. Mean number of 11, line drug used in study regimen was 1.39 (Std dev 0.844). Mean number of months when culture conversion was seen was 5.090 (Std dev 0.92113) and that of smear conversion was seen in 3.809 (Std dev 0.813575). Complete resolution of radiological opacity was seen in 9.67% and residual fibrosis in 90.32%. Side effects of drugs were seen in 61.29%. Statistical analysis shows age, inclusion of ofloxacin in regimen have no stastistical significance where as male sex, lesser no of previously used drugs, lesser number of resistant drugs, higher number of active drug, addition of 1(st) line drug in regimen, use of kanamycin in regimen were associated with successful outcome. Previous use of ofloxacin, extensive diseases were associated with unsuccessful outcome. Conclusion: Multidrug resistant tuberculosis can be cured by intensive treatment regimens but have low cure rates and high cost and problematic in resource poor country.	multidrug resistant tuberculosis; treatment; outcome	HIV-INFECTION; DOTS-PLUS; CHEMOTHERAPY; OUTBREAK; THERAPY; COST; PERU
10.1093_jac_dkp124	Rapid identification of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates by rpoB gene scanning using high-resolution melting curve PCR analysis	Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis poses a serious threat to the control of tuberculosis (TB) and constitutes an increasing public health problem. The availability of rapid in vitro susceptibility tests is a prerequisite for optimal patient treatment. Rifampicin resistance caused by diverse mutations in the rpoB gene is an established and widely used surrogate marker for MDR-TB. We used a high-resolution melting (HRM) curve analysis approach to scan for mutations in the rpoB gene. A total of 49 MDR-TB and 19 fully susceptible non-MDR-TB isolates, as determined by conventional drug susceptibility testing using the BACTEC-MGIT960 system, were used to evaluate the suitability of HRM curve analysis as a rapid and accurate screening system for rifampicin resistance. HRM analysis of the rpoB cluster I site allowed the correct allocation of 44 of the 49 MDR-TB isolates and all non-MDR-TB isolates. Three of the five MDR-TB isolates (60%) falsely identified as non-MDR-TB harboured the V176F mutation that could be specifically detected by an additional HRM assay. The combined HRM analysis of all strains and isolates exhibited 95.9% sensitivity and 100% specificity. With a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of at least 99.9%, this combined HRM curve analysis is an ideal screening method for the TB laboratory, with minimal requirements of cost and time. The method is a closed-tube assay that can be performed in an interchangeable 96- or 384-well microplate format enabling a rapid, reliable, simple and cost-effective handling of even large sample numbers.

10.1128_JCM.02167_08	High Diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Genotypes in South Africa and Preponderance of Mixed Infections among ST53 Isolates	The reemergence of tuberculosis (TB) has become a major health problem worldwide, especially in Asia and Africa. Failure to combat this disease due to nonadherence or inappropriate drug regimens has selected for the emergence of multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) TB. The development of new molecular genotyping techniques has revealed the presence of mixed Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections, which may accelerate the emergence of drug-resistant strains. There are some studies describing the local distribution of circulating strains in South Africa, but to date, reports describing the frequency and distribution of M. tuberculosis genotypes, and specifically MDR genotypes, across the different provinces are limited. Thus, 252 isolates (of which 109 were MDR) from eight of the nine provinces of South Africa were analyzed by spoligotyping. Spoligotyping showed 10 different lineages, and ST53 (11.1%) and ST1 (10.3%) were the most frequent genotypes. Of the 75 different spoligopatterns observed, 20 (7.9%) were previously unreported. Analysis of the mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units of variable-number tandem repeats of the ST53 and ST1 isolates revealed that similar to 54% of the ST53 isolates were of mixed M. tuberculosis subpopulations. Drug resistance (defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and/or rifampin) could only be linked to a history of previous anti-TB treatment (adjusted odds ratio, 4.0; 95% confidence interval, 2.27 to 7.10; P = < 0.0001). This study describes a high diversity of circulating genotypes in South Africa in addition to a high frequency of mixed M. tuberculosis subpopulations among the ST53 isolates. MDR TB in South Africa could not be attributed to the spread of any single lineage.

10.1055_s_0029_1185458	The Value of Surgical Resection in Patients with Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis	Background: Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) still continues to be a serious health problem throughout the world. Although main treatment of MDR-TB is medical, Surgical resection with adjuvant medical therapy may increase the chance of cure in selected patients. Methods: We performed surgical resections in 55 patients between 1997 and 2005; 36 were male and 19 were female with a median age of 34 years (range 13 to 66 years). Sputum was negative for 49 patients and positive for 6 patients in the preoperative period. Patients were treated according to a new therapy protocol for a mean of 3.7 months before the operation. Results: Lobectomy was performed in 37 patients, pneumonectomy in 17 patients and lobectomy + segmentectomy in I patient. One patient with positive sputum preoperatively died in the early postoperative period (mortality: 1.81%). Various complications occurred in 16 (29.09%) patients. Prolonged air leak was the most common complication (n = 8). Bronchopleural fistula (BPF) + empyema occurred in 2 (3.63%) patients. In the postoperative period, sputum negativity was achieved in all patients except three cases throughout the 57 months Of follow-up (Cure rate 94.5%). Patients received drug therapy for 24 months postoperatively. Conclusions: Surgical resection with adjuvant drug therapy increases the chance of cure in patients with localized disease if they have an adequate cardiopulmonary reserve, favorable nutritional status and are treated with a new therapy protocol for at least 3 months.

10.1186_1471_2334_9_67	Direct susceptibility testing for multi drug resistant tuberculosis: A meta-analysis	Background: One of the challenges facing the tuberculosis (TB) control programmes in resource-limited settings is lack of rapid techniques for detection of drug resistant TB, particularly multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). Results obtained with the conventional indirect susceptibility testing methods come too late to influence a timely decision on patient management. More rapid tests directly applied on sputum samples are needed. This study compared the sensitivity, specificity and time to results of four direct drug susceptibility testing tests with the conventional indirect testing for detection of resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid in M. tuberculosis. The four direct tests included two in-house phenotypic assays - Nitrate Reductase Assay (NRA) and Microscopic Observation Drug Susceptibility (MODS), and two commercially available tests - Genotype (R) MTBDR and Genotype (R) MTBDRplus (Hain Life Sciences, Nehren, Germany). Methods: A literature review and meta-analysis of study reports was performed. The Meta-Disc software was used to analyse the reports and tests for sensitivity, specificity, and area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves. Heterogeneity in accuracy estimates was tested with the Spearman correlation coefficient and Chi-square. Results: Eighteen direct DST reports were analysed: NRA - 4, MODS-6, Genotype MTBDR (R) - and Genotype (R) MTBDRplus - 5. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for detection of resistance to rifampicin were 99% and 100% with NRA, 96% and 96% with MODS, 99% and 98% with Genotype (R) MTBDR, and 99% and 99% with the new Genotype (R) MTBDRplus, respectively. For isoniazid it was 94% and 100% for NRA, 92% and 96% for MODS, 71% and 100% for Genotype (R) MTBDR, and 96% and 100% with the Genotype (R) MTBDRplus, respectively. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves was in ranges of 0.98 to 1.00 for all the four tests. Molecular tests were completed in 1 - 2 days and also the phenotypic assays were much more rapid than conventional testing. Conclusion: Direct testing of rifampicin and isoniazid resistance in M. tuberculosis was found to be highly sensitive and specific, and allows prompt detection of MDR TB.

10.1086_598191	Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis and Pregnancy: Treatment Outcomes of 38 Cases in Lima, Peru	Background. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) disproportionately affects young adults, including women of childbearing age; however, treatment of MDR-TB during pregnancy is still controversial. This study looks at the treatment and pregnancy outcomes in a cohort of women who were treated for MDR-TB during pregnancy during a period of 10 years. Methods. A retrospective case study was performed using a standardized data collection form and data from 3 ranked sources of patient records. All 38 participants were treated during pregnancy with individualized regimens that included second-line TB medications. We examined the frequency of favorable and adverse outcomes with regard to disease and pregnancy. Results. After completion of MDR-TB treatment, 61% of the women were cured, 13% had died, 13% had defaulted, 5% remained in treatment, and 5% had experienced treatment failure. Four of the women experienced clinical deterioration of TB during pregnancy. Five of the pregnancies terminated in spontaneous abortions, and 1 child was stillborn. Among the living newborns, 3 were born with low birth weight, 1 was born prematurely, and 1 had fetal distress. Conclusions. The rates of success in treating MDR-TB in our cohort are comparable to those of other MDR-TB treatment programs in Peru. The birth outcomes of our cohort are similar to those among the general Peru population. Therefore, we advocate that a woman should be given the option to continue treatment of MDR-TB rather than terminating pregnancy or discontinuing MDR-TB treatment.

10.1590_S0100_879X2009000500006	Phenotypic and genotypic variant of MDR-Mycobacterium tuberculosis multiple isolates in the same tuberculosis episode, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil	Assuming that the IS6110-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) changes at a constant rate of 3.2 years, this methodology was applied to demonstrate, for the first time, variant patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in multiple isolates obtained at short time intervals from sputum and blood of an HIV(+) patient with multiple admissions to the Emergency Room and to the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Reference Center of a secondary-care hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In sputum, the IS6110-RFLP appeared in isolates with two variant patterns with 10 and 13IS6110 copies. However, blood presented only the pattern corresponding to 10 copies, suggesting compartmentalization. With regard to the exact match of 10 of 13 bands, this may be a subpopulation with the same clonal origin and this may be related to the IS6110 transposition. A susceptibility test demonstrated an MDR profile (INH(R), RIF(R), SM(R), and EMB(R)), with the sputum isolate also exhibiting EMB(S) (R = resistant; S = sensitive). A gene mutation confirmed resistance only to streptomycin. There was agreement between the results of the phenotypic test and the clinical response to MDR-TB treatment, suggesting serious implications with regard to treatment administration based exclusively on molecular methods, and calling attention to the fact that more effective control strategies against the emergence of MDR strains must be implemented by the TB control program to prevent transmission of MDR-MTB strains at health facilities in areas highly endemic for TB.

10.1183_09031936.00155708	Predictors of poor treatment outcome in multi- and extensively drug-resistant pulmonary TB	Treatment outcome in multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) is often unsuccessful, but the particular determinants of poor treatment outcome have remained obscure. The present authors therefore analysed treatment effectiveness and predictors of poor treatment outcome in pulmonary MDR-TB and XDR-TB in Estonia, a European country with one of the highest MDR-TB and XDR-TB rates in the world. All culture-confirmed pulmonary MDR-TB and XDR-TB patients who started TB treatment in 2003-2005 were included. Multivariate analysis was performed on two models of predictors: 1) patients' HIV-status, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics; and 2) TB-related data. In the 235 MDR-TB patients, the proportion of overall successful treatment outcome was 60.4%, rising to 72.8% among adherent patients. Among the 54 XDR-TB patients, these proportions were 42.6% and 50.0%, respectively. Risk factors for poor treatment outcome in MDR-TB were HIV infection, previous TB treatment, resistance to ofloxacin and positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear at the start of treatment. Predictors of poor treatment outcome in XDR-TB were urban residence and positive AFB smear. This country-wide study provides evidence that to improve treatment outcome in multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, special care should be taken to treat HIV-infected patients and urban residents, as well as to make efforts to diminish re-treatment cases by increasing patient adherence.

pub-1602	In vitro effect of fluoroquinolones against Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Agra & Kanpur region of north India	Background & objectives: Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are important drugs used for treatment of drug resistant tuberculosis and are also now being considered as first line drugs to shorten the duration of treatment of tuberculosis (TB). In order to find out useful FQs for treatment of tuberculosis, the comparative efficacy of five FQs, namely, ofloxacin (OFL), ciprofloxacin (CIP), sparfloxacin (SPX), gatifloxacin (GAT) and levofloxacin (LEVX) was studied against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates obtained from both treated and untreated patients from Agra and Kanpur regions of north India. Methods: A total of 162 MTB isolates [including 110 MTB isolates obtained from untreated patients (Cat-I) and 52 isolates from treated patients (Cat-II)] were tested for their susceptibilities to FQs using standard minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. Results: Keeping in view the therapeutically achievable drug levels, it was found that in Cat-I 97.2 per cent (107/110) isolates were sensitive to GAT, 89 per cent (98/110) to LEVX at 1 mu g/ml whereas 92.7 per cent (102/110) isolates were inhibited by OFL at 2 mu g/ml and 73.6 per cent (81/110) to SPX at 0.5 mu g/ml. Only 63.6 per cent (70/110) isolates were found to be sensitive to CIP at 2 mu g/ml which increased to 89 per cent (98/110) at 4 mu g/ml (higher than achievable peak serum level). On the other hand, among 52 isolates for Cat-II, 37 (71.2%) were found to be sensitive to GAT and 33 (63.5%) to LEVX at 1 mu g/ml concentration, 28 (53.8%) to SPX at 0.5 mu g/ml whereas 33 (63.5%) and 24 (46.2%) isolates were found to be sensitive to OFL and CIP at 2 mu g/ml, respectively. Interpretation & conclusions: It appears that GAT has higher activity against MTB isolates followed by OFL, LEVX and SPX whereas CIP showed the lowest activity. GAT was also found to be the most effective FQ against multi-drug resistant (NIDR) isolates both from Cat-I and Cat-it patients. Thus, except CIP, other FQs showed potential to be included in the treatment regimens of tuberculosis including MDR-TB.

10.1016_j.ijantimicag.2008.10.028	SILA 421, an inhibitor of efflux pumps of cancer cells, enhances the killing of intracellular extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB)	Multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/XDR-TB) are problematic to manage, especially in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). There is therefore a dire need for effective anti-MDR/XDR-TB agents. We have previously shown that agents that inhibit the efflux pumps of MDR bacteria and cancer cells also enhance killing of intracellular mycobacteria, possibly by increasing the availability of K(+) and Ca(2+) needed for the activation of lysosomal enzymes of the phagolyso-somal unit. In this study, the newly synthesised and recently patented SILA 409 and 421 were tested for in vitro and ex vivo activity against XDR-TB. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of SILA compounds was determined by the BACTEC 460 TB system. The effect of each compound on the killing activity of human macrophages infected with XDR-TB was determined by exposing the macrophage that had phagocytosed the bacterium to the compounds and assessing the killing activity by colony-forming unit counting. Amongst the two compounds tested, SILA 421 was shown to have in vitro activity against XDR-TB (MIC < 3.5 mg/L) and to transform non-killing macrophages into effective killers of phagocytosed bacteria, without any cytotoxic activity. Because SILA 421 revealed good in vitro and ex vivo activities and is devoid of any cytotoxic activity, it is a potential candidate as an anti-MDR/XDR-TB drug. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.

10.1128_JCM.02284_08	First Insight into Genetic Diversity of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex in Albania Obtained by Multilocus Variable-Number Tandem-Repeat Analysis and Spoligotyping Reveals the Presence of Beijing Multidrug-Resistant Isolates	We characterized a set of 100 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex clinical isolates from tuberculosis (TB) patients in Albania, typing them with a 24-locus variable-number tandem-repeat-spoligotyping scheme. Depending on the cluster definition, 43 to 49 patients were distributed into 15 to 16 clusters which were likely to be epidemiologically linked, indicative of a recent transmission rate of 28 to 34%. This result suggests that TB is under control in Albania. However, two multidrug-resistant (MDR) Beijing genotypes harboring the same S531A mutation on the rpoB gene were also found, suggesting a potential recent transmission of MDR TB. Three brand new genotypes, Albania-1 to Albania-3, are also described.		IDENTIFICATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MUTATIONS; EVOLUTION; BULGARIA
10.3348_kjr.2009.10.3.207	Radiological Findings of Extensively Drug-Resistant Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Non-AIDS Adults: Comparisons with Findings of Multidrug-Resistant and Drug-Sensitive Tuberculosis	Objective: This study was designed to describe the radiological findings of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and to compare the observed findings with findings of drug-sensitive (DS) and non-XDR multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB in non-AIDS patients. Materials and Methods: From September 1994 to December 2007, 53 MDR TB patients (M:F = 32:21; mean age, 38 years) and 15 XDR TB non-AIDS patients (M:F = 8:7; mean age, 36 years) were enrolled in the study. All of the MDR TB patients had received no treatment or less than one month of anti-TB treatment. In addition, all XDR TB patients received either no anti-TB treatment or only first-line anti-TB drugs. In addition, 141 consecutive DS TB patients (M:F = 79:62; mean age, 51 years) were also enrolled in the study for comparison. Chest radiograph, CT and demographic findings were reviewed and were compared among the three patient groups. Results: For patients with XDR TB, the most frequent radiographic abnormalities were nodules (15 of 15 patients, 100%), reticulo-nodular densities (11 of 15, 73%), consolidation (9 of 15, 60%) and cavities (7 of 15, 47%) that were located mainly in the upper and middle lung zones. As seen on radiographs, significant differences were found for the frequency of nodules and ground-glass opacity lesions (all p < 0.001) (more frequent in DS TB patients than in MDR and XDR TB patients). For the use of CT, significant differences (more frequent in MDR and XDR TB patients) were found for the frequency of multiple cavities, nodules and bronchial dilatation (p = 0.001 or p < 0.001). Patients with MDR TB and XDR TB were younger as compared to patients with DS TB (p < 0.001). Imaging findings were not different between patients with MDR TB and XDR TB. Conclusion: By observation of multiple cavities, nodules and bronchial dilatation as depicted on CT in young patients with acid-fast bacilli (AFB) positive sputum, the presence of MDR TB or XDR TB rather than DS TB can be suggested. There is no significant difference in imaging findings between patients with XDR TB and MDR TB.

10.1111_j.1440_1843.2008.01478.x	In vitro cytotoxicity of CD8+T cells in multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. A preliminary report	Specific CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity has been recognized as being involved in the elimination of drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB). Given that there is currently no information on the cytotoxic effector functions of CD8+ T cells in multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), our objective was to analyse the cytotoxic activity, both basal and stimulated, of CD8+ T cells from MDR-TB patients and compare it with that of DS-TB patients, as well as purified protein derivative (PPD)+ and PPD- subjects. Cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells from MDR-TB patients, DS-TB patients, PPD+ and PPD- subjects was measured by a colorimetric assay, using H37Rv culture filtrate protein as the antigenic stimulus. Twenty-eight subjects were studied (7 MDR-TB patients, 7 DS-TB patients, 7 PPD+ subjects and 7 PPD- subjects). In the presence of the antigenic stimulus, the cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells from MDR-TB patients (% lysis) increased from 6.7% to 59.6% (P < 0.001). In DS-TB patients lysis increased from 3.2% to 22.5% (P < 0.001), whereas in PPD+ subjects it increased from 2.7% to 12.0% (P < 0.001) and in PPD- subjects from 1.3% to 3.2% (P < 0.001). Basal cytotoxic activity was significantly higher for MDR-TB patients than PPD+ and PPD- subjects (P = 0.003), but not compared with that for DS-TB patients (P = 0.05). Stimulated cytotoxic activity was highest for MDR-TB patients. CD8+ T cells from MDR-TB patients showed an exaggerated cytotoxic activity after antigenic stimulation. Further studies are required to elucidate the role of this response in the immunopathogenesis of MDR-TB.	antigenic stimulation; CD8+T cell; cytotoxicity; multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis	CD8(+) T-CELLS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; MDR-TB; INFECTION; RESPONSES; MICE; ACTIVATION; PROTECTION; VACCINES
10.1016_j.tube.2009.03.001	The clinical relevance of Mycobacterial pharmacogenetics	Current anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) drug sensitivity testing methods provide a dichotomous readout: isolates are reported as either drug susceptible or drug resistant. This report demonstrates that rapid molecular methods may provide information concerning both the level of resistance and cross-resistance to other anti-TB drugs that is important for optimal clinical management. Specific mutations detected by the Hain GenoType (R) MTBDRplus test, recently approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) for rapid TB diagnosis and drug resistance testing, could inform the decision of whether to include high dose isoniazid (INH) when treating patients with INH mono-resistant TB, MDR-TB or XDR-TB. The presence of mutations in the inhA gene or promoter region generally confers low level INH resistance that can be overcome by high dose INK The same mutations also confer resistance to ethionamide indicating little benefit from its inclusion in second line treatment regimens in such cases. This information has high clinical relevance since inhA mutations account for a large proportion of INH resistance, and optimized therapy regimens are crucial to improve patient outcomes and reduce the spread of drug resistant TB. This hypothesis needs to be tested in well controlled clinical and pharmacokinetic studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, naturally occurring M. tuberculosis infections are caused by strains that are widely different in phenotype and genotype. Very little is known about the characteristics of these clinical isolates in terms of basic biology, virulence and in vivo pathogenicity. In this study, we have used a standardized aerosol infection of guinea pigs to compare in vivo differences between clinical strains of M. tuberculosis. Strains consisted of both drug sensitive and multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains of Beijing and non-Beijing varieties. Collectively, these clinical isolates tested in the guinea pig model exhibited a wide range of virulence. Infection with certain isolates caused severe and rapidly progressive pulmonary and extra-pulmonary lesion necrosis, some of which progressed to atypical cavitary lesions in draining mediastinal and tracheobronchial lymph nodes. The two MDR-TB strains used in this study exhibited low level virulence as determined by bacterial growth, lesion scores and survival. Since infections with clinical M. tuberculosis isolates produce such varied disease, it is unknown whether new tuberculosis vaccines being developed will provide the same level of protection as seen when tested using laboratory challenge strains. The use of appropriate animal models allows for this important question to be addressed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.1021_jm900003c	Structure-Activity Relationships for a Series of Quinoline-Based Compounds Active against Replicating and Nonreplicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Tuberculosis (TB) remains as a global pandemic that is aggravated by a lack of health care, the spread of HIV, and the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) strains. New anti-TB drugs are urgently required to shorten the long 6-12 month treatment regimen and to battle drug-resistant Mtb strains. We have identified several potent quinoline-based anti-TB compounds, bearing an isoxazole containing side-chain. The most potent compounds, 7g and 13, exhibited submicromolar activity against the replicating bacteria (R-TB), with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.77 and 0.95 mu M, respectively. In general, these compounds also had micromolar activity against the nonreplicating persistent bacteria (NRP-TB) and did not show toxicity on Vero cells up to 128 mu M concentration. Compounds 7g and 13 were shown to retain their anti-TB activity against rifampin, isoniazid, and streptomycin resistant Mtb strains. The results suggest that quinoline-isoxazole-based anti-TB compounds are promising leads for new TB drug development.

10.1111_j.1600_0463.2009.02438.x	Drug resistance and genotypic analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains from Thai tuberculosis patients	Cheunoy W, Haile M, Chaiprasert A, Prammananan T, Cristea-Fernstrom M, Vondracek M, Chryssanthou E, Hoffner S, Petrini B. Drug resistance and genotypic analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains from Thai tuberculosis patients. APMIS 2009; 117: 286-90. The aim of this study was the molecular characterization of primary drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in Thailand. We examined a group of M. tuberculosis isolates from newly registered tuberculosis (TB) cases, collected at the largest university hospital, the Siriraj Hospital, in Thailand. Of 76 selected drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains recovered from previously untreated pulmonary TB patients whose sputum samples were sent to this hospital, 29 (38%) were single-drug resistant, 26 (34%) multidrug resistant and two (2.6%) extensively drug resistant. Fifty (66%) strains belonged to Beijing genotype. The study demonstrate a severe problem of drug resistance among recently detected TB patients, and two large clusters of genetically similar strains indicated ongoing transmission of drug-resistant TB.

pub-1611	A pilot study on prevalence and cure rate of tuberculosis in selected areas of Malabar 2006-07.	Objective To study the prevalence and cure rate of tuberculosis(TB) and the people affected by TB in selected areas, considering different factors like age, sex, percentage of people affected, dosage forms, role of hospitals, and patient category. Methods : A detailed survey was carried out in and around Perinthalmanna and Wayanad (Urban and Rural) to understand the burden and overall trend of TB in our locality and how effective our TB control programme. More than 250 treatment cards were collected from the Government hospitals and TB Sanatorium. Results In the study, at Perinthalmanna and Wayanad, out of 250 TB patients it was found that males is more susceptible than females, rural area accounting for the greater proportion of TB patients. Greater proportion were affected with pulmonary than extra pulmonary Tuberculosis. The incidence of tuberculosis in different age groups varied according to the area. Half proportion in both rural and urban areas were belonging to category II followed by category III. Conclusion :The nature and magnitude of TB is more in rural area than urban area mainly because of the lack of awareness of the severity of disease and improper follow up of preventive measures. Our study suggests that the combined and committed efforts of government, non government organizations, medical and paramedical professional and society is required at large, to reach all patients and ensure that they receive high quality care.

10.1007_s10096_008_0627_y	Risk factors for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in a tuberculosis unit in Madrid, Spain	The setting for this retrospective cohort study was a specialised tuberculosis unit in Madrid, Spain. The objective was to describe the risk factors for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The medical records of all patients admitted to the unit were reviewed retrospectively to identify factors associated with multidrug resistance. Patients with positive culture for M. tuberculosis and with available drug-susceptibility tests were included. The variables assessed were age, gender, country of origin, homelessness, alcohol consumption, intravenous drug use, methadone substitution therapy, contact with a tuberculosis patient, sputum smear, site of disease, previous tuberculosis treatment, HIV infection, history of imprisonment, diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Thirty patients with MDR-TB and 666 patients with non-MDR-TB were included from the years 1997 to 2006. The only factors associated with MDR-TB in multivariate analysis were previous tuberculosis treatment (OR: 3.44; 95% CI: 1.58-7.50; p = 0.003), age group 45-64 years (OR: 3.24; 95% CI: 1.34-7.81; p = 0.009) and alcohol abuse (OR: 0.12; 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.55; p = 0.003). In our study, patients who had had previous treatment for tuberculosis, who were 45-64 years of age or who had no history of alcohol abuse were more likely to have MDR-TB.

pub-1613	Risk factors for new pulmonary tuberculosis patients failing treatment under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme, India	SETTING: Tertiary level tuberculosis (TB) institute in Delhi, India. OBJECTIVE: To study the risk factors for new pulmonary TB (PTB) patients failing treatment. DESIGN: Prospective case-control study. The profile of new PTB patients failing treatment (i.e., sputum smear-positive at 5 months of treatment) and responders under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) were compared and risk factors associated with treatment failure were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 42 treatment failure cases and 76 controls were enrolled in the study. The presence of cavity on chest X-ray (CXR), sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear positivity at 2 months of treatment and the number of interruptions in treatment were independently associated with failures. Among failure patients at 5 months, 17 (40.5%) had negative sputum culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and only six (14.3%) had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). When put on retreatment patients with smear-positive, culture-negative sputum had cure rates of 88.2% compared to 28.6% among culture-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of cavity on CXR, sputum smear positivity at 2 months of treatment and the number of interruptions of treatment are risk factors for failure. Among failures based on smear examination, the prevalence of MDR-TB is low and many patients have negative cultures for M. tuberculosis. Smear positivity at the end of treatment may not be a reliable indicator of treatment failure.	tuberculosis; treatment failure; treatment outcome; risk factors	TREATMENT FAILURE; RETREATMENT REGIMEN; CATEGORY
10.1371_journal.pone.0004870	Fluoromycobacteriophages for Rapid, Specific, and Sensitive Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is of paramount importance as multiple- and extensively-drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis emerge and spread. We describe here a virus-based assay in which fluoromycobacteriophages are used to deliver a GFP or ZsYellow fluorescent marker gene to M. tuberculosis, which can then be monitored by fluorescent detection approaches including fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry. Pre-clinical evaluations show that addition of either Rifampicin or Streptomycin at the time of phage addition obliterates fluorescence in susceptible cells but not in isogenic resistant bacteria enabling drug sensitivity determination in less than 24 hours. Detection requires no substrate addition, fewer than 100 cells can be identified, and resistant bacteria can be detected within mixed populations. Fluorescence withstands fixation by paraformaldehyde providing enhanced biosafety for testing MDR-TB and XDR-TB infections.		
pub-1615	TRENDS IN MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS IN SCOTLAND, 2000-7	Overall numbers of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis ( TB) rose sharply in the United Kingdom and Scotland in 2007. Risk factors associated with MDR TB in the United Kingdom have been identified but there has been no previous report on risk factors associated with MDR TB in Scotland. Enhanced Surveillance of Mycobacterial Infections (ESMI) data were used to examine demographic and clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of MDR TB cases notified in Scotland between 2000-7. There was a total of 11 culture-positive cases of MDR TB, five of which were notified in 2007. The majority of patients were female, 15-44 years old and unemployed. All were born outside the United Kingdom and most had arrived within the past year from or frequently travelled to their home countries in China, the Indian subcontinent or Africa. Except for one individual, our patients did not self report a history of previous diagnosis of TB which was previously identified as a risk factor for MDR TB in the United Kingdom. Only three patients received directly observed treatment (DOT). Only two patients had completed treatment at 12 months, partially due to the inadequate length of follow-up under the current ESMI system. Our results suggest that most patients had primary resistance due to transmission of MDR TB in high incidence countries and thus point to the importance of international efforts to control MDR TB in these countries. In Scotland, national efforts should be made to increase the number of MDR TB patients receiving DOT and to extend follow-up to improve monitoring of treatment outcome. It is important to identify high risk groups for MDR TB infection in order to deliver effective community-based disease control measures.		DRUG-RESISTANT; UNITED-KINGDOM; RISK-FACTORS

10.1097_MAJ.0b013e318185d32f	Nontuberculous Mycobacteria Among Patients Who are Suspected for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis-Need for Earlier Identification of Nontuberculosis Mycobacteria	Background: In this study, we intended to find the prevalence of nontuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) among patients who are referred as suspected multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases to the only referral center in Iran. Methods: All patients referred to our center in 2002-2006 as MDR-TB with histories of treatment with standard and CAT 11 World Health Organization regimens were included in the Study, Sputum smear and culture for acid-fast bacilli were performed for all patients 3 times. Sputum polymerase chain reaction was also performed for all patients. Mycobacterial identification was performed via polymerase chain reaction and routine identification tests for all culture-positive cases. Results: Of the 105 patients in the study, 12 (11.43%) were identified to have NTM infection. The identified mycobacteria were classified in order of prevalence as Chelonae (8 cases), Simiae (2 cases), Aloei (1 case), and Farcinogen (1case). Based on radiologic findings, most of the cases demonstrated bilateral nodularity (83.3%) and also multifocal bronchiectasis (75%). Notably, cavitary lesions were present in 41.7% of the cases. Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, it is essential that such cases be identified before commencing MDR-TB treatment.

10.1183_09031936.00099608	Impact of resistance to first-line and injectable drugs on treatment outcomes in MDR-TB	Recently, resistance to additional first-line and injectable drugs was reported to be an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes in multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) patients. The aim of the present study was to confirm these observations in MDR-TB patients without Hill infection. MDR-TB patients treated at a tertiary referral hospital in South Korea between January 1996 and December 2005 were included. The unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios of adverse treatment outcome were calculated for resistance to each drug and combination of drugs using simple or multiple logistic regressions. None of the resistance to additional first-line or injectable drugs was associated with higher odds for adverse treatment outcome in 155 MDR but nonextensively drug-resistant (non-XDR) TB patients. However, streptomycin resistance was associated with 12 times the odds for adverse treatment outcome in 42 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB patients. Neither combinations of first-line drugs nor those of injectable drugs were associated with increased odds for adverse treatment outcomes in non-XDR MDR-TB patients or XDR-TB patients. Only streptomycin resistance among the first-line or injectable drugs was associated with adverse treatment outcomes in extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis patients without HIV infection.

10.1016_j.ijid.2008.06.001	Pulmonary resection combined with isoniazid- and rifampin-based drug therapy for patients with multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis	Objective: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of pulmonary resection and postoperative use of a first-line drug regimen for patients with well-localized, cavitary pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). Methods: This was a prospective case study set in the National Masan Tuberculosis Hospital in Masan, Republic of Korea. From February 1998 to May 2004, 19 patients with well-localized, cavitary pulmonary MDR-TB or XDR-TB were enrolled and followed prospectively through April 2007. After radical surgical resection, patients were treated with anti-tuberculous therapy consisting of isoniazid (H), rifampin (R), ethambutol (E), pyrazinamide (Z), and streptomycin (S) (3HREZS/3HRES/6HRE). Results: All recovered isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, and to a mean of 4.7 anti-tuberculous drugs (range 2-8 drugs). Seventeen patients had MDR-TB and two had XDR-TB. Surgical procedures included: lobectomy (14 patients), lobectomy plus segmentectomy or wedge resection (four patients), and pneumonectomy (one patient). The median time to postoperative sputum smear and culture conversion was 2 days (range 1-23 days). Fifteen (78.9%) subjects, including both with XDR-TB, had durable cures (mean follow-up period 53.2 months). One patient failed to convert her sputum and was successfully switched to second-tine therapy. Another patient developed active disease again 68 months after cure, likely due to re-infection with a new M. tuberculosis strain. Two patients were lost to follow-up after hospital discharge. Conclusion: Resectional lung surgery combined with isoniazid- and rifampin-based anti-tuberculous chemotherapy can be an effective treatment strategy for patients with well-localized, cavitary pulmonary MDR-TB and XDR-TB.

10.1016_j.ijnurstu.2008.09.013	Experiences of a community-based tuberculosis treatment programme in Namibia: A comparative cohort study	Background: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a widespread healthcare problem in Africa, although it can be cured within 6-8 months' effective treatment. However, many patients fail to adhere to TB treatment, resulting in failure to get cured and the possible development of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR TB). A community-based TB treatment programme, was started in the Omaheke region of Namibia during 2002. The efficacy of this community-based TB programme, compared to the standard hospital- and clinic-based TB treatment. was unknown. Objectives: The major objectives were to compare TB treatment Outcomes for patients who used the community-based TB with those who chose the clinic/self-administered TB treatment option; and to identify advantages and disadvantages of community-based TB care as experienced by patients who had completed their community-based TB treatment. Design: A quasi-experimental Study design was used to compare TB patients' treatment Outcomes using checklists and exit interviews. Setting: The study was conducted in the Omaheke region of Namibia. Participants: TB patients (n = 332) who were hospitalised during the study period participated in the study. Methods: An analytic cohort prospective design was used to do follow-up visits, and complete check-lists, of 332 TB patients. Structured exit interviews were conducted with 101 TB patients who had completed their community-based TB treatment. Results: Enhanced knowledge of TB patients improved their participation in community-based TB care. A family member was the most convenient, acceptable and accessible directly observed treatment (DOT) supervisor for 72.8% of the participants. A statistically significant difference in Cure rates between community-based and the clinic/self-administered groups was found (chi(2) 11.78; p <= 0.05; and RR = 1.35; p = 0.05). The major advantages of community-based TB treatment included the ability to continue with one's daily activities during treatment and the saving of time and money. The major disadvantages included that the clinics ran Out of TB drug supplies, patients did not always have food to cat after taking their pills and they could not get sufficient rest because they had to continue doing their daily chores. Conclusions: TB patients on the community-based TB treatment option had better cure rates than those on clinic/self-administered TB treatment (although it cannot be inferred that the community-based treatment caused the improved cure rates, because the TB patients who did not select the community-based treatment option might have been different). The advantages experienced by patients who completed their community-based TB treatment outweighed the disadvantages. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

pub-1621	Risk Factors for Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis in Patients at Tertiary Care Hospital, Peshawar	Objective: To determine the frequency of common risk factors for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in patients presented at a tertiary care hospital, Peshawar. Study Design: Cross-sectional, observational study. Place and Duration of Study: Pulmonology Department, Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, from December 2006 to October 2007. Methodology: Patients with positive AFB culture and sensitivity results and found resistant to both rifampicin and isoniazid with or with resistance to other first line anti-tuberculosis drugs, were recruited from both Pulmonology Ward and Outpatient Department (OPD). Informed verbal consent was taken and a questionnaire administered to all participants of the study. Information regarding demographics, education status, occupation, monthly household income, AFB C/S, details of past history of tuberculosis and family history of TB or Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR-TB) was recorded. Data was analyzed on SPSS version 11. Results: A total of 30 patients of MDR-TB were interviewed. Male (n=17) and female (n=13) ratio was 1.31. Mean age was 34.2 +/- 15.3 years. Ninety-two percent female and 52.9% male were uneducated. In 56.7%, monthly income was less than 5000 rupees and in 40% between 5000-10,000 rupees. All patients had previous history of Antituberculous Treatment (ATT), in which 20% had undertaken ATT course once, 53.3% twice and 26.7% thrice in the past. In the study group, 13 (43.3%) patients had not completed their first ATT course and 11 of them were receiving ATT from a general practitioner (GP) at that time. Seven (23.3%) patients had family history of TB but no one had documented MDR-TB in the family. Resistance to RH was present in all patients; moreover, 56.7% had resistance to RHEZ+S. Conclusion: The most common factors in the study group were previous history of tuberculosis, repeated courses of ATT, prescribed by different clinicians and unsupervised treatment by a GP during the initial course of ATT.

10.1016_j.pep.2008.09.020	Purification and characterization of anthranilate synthase component I (TrpE) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv	The emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the main reason why tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a major health problem worldwide. It is urgent to discover novel anti-mycobacterial agents based on new drug targets for the treatment of TB, especially MDR-TB. Tryptophan biosynthetic pathway, which is essential for the survival of M. tuberculosis and meanwhile absent in mammals, provides potential anti-TB drug targets. One of the promising drug targets in this pathway is anthranilate synthase component I (TrpE), whose role is to catalyze the conversion of chorismate to anthranilate using ammonia as amino source. In order to get a deep understanding of TrpE, a study on purification and characteristic identification of TrpE is required. In this work, the putative trpE gene of M. tuberculosis H37Rv was expressed as a fusion protein with a 6x His-tag on the N-terminal (His-TrpE) in Escherichia coli. The recombinant TrpE protein was successfully purified and then its enzymatic characteristics were analyzed. The native TrpE without His-tag was obtained by removal of the N-terminal fusion partner of His-TrpE using enterokinase. It was found that N-terminal fusion partner had little influence on TrpE catalytic activity. In addition, the key residues related to enzyme catalytic activity and that involved in I-tryptophan inhibition were predicted in the structure of M. tuberculosis H37Rv TrpE. These results would be beneficial to the designing of novel anti-TB drugs with high potency and selectivity. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

10.5483_BMBRep.2009.42.2.081	Microplate hybridization assay for detection of isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Early and accurate detection of drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis can improve both the treatment outcome and public health control of tuberculosis. A number of molecular based techniques have been developed including ones using probe molecules that target drug resistance-related mutations. Although these techniques are highly specific and sensitive, mixed signals can be obtained when the drug resistant isolates are mixed with drug susceptible isolates. In order to overcome this problem, we developed a new drug susceptibility test (DST) for one of the most effective anti-tuberculosis drug, isoniazid. This technique employed a microplate hybridization assay that quantified signals from each probe molecule, and was evaluated using clinical isolates. The evaluation analysis clearly showed that the microplate hybridization assay was an accurate and rapid method that overcame the limitations of DST based on conventional molecular techniques.

pub-1626	Validation of the line-probe assay for rapid detection of rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Vietnam	BACKGROUND: Delays in identifying multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) contribute to higher TB morbidity and mortality, and ongoing transmission. The line-probe assay (LiPA) is a rapid, commercially available polymerase chain reaction based assay that detects most mutations in the rpoB gene for rifampicin (RMP) resistance. We validated and compared this assay with conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST). METHODS: We re-cultured a random sample of stored isolates known to be either RMP-resistant or RMP-susceptible according to DST (proportion method). We performed a blinded comparison between LiPA and conventional DST. Genetic sequencing of the rpoB gene was performed on RMP-resistant isolates and discordant results. RESULTS: We tested 79 RMP-resistant and 64 RMP-susceptible strains. Concordance of LiPA with DST was 94%. For detecting RMP resistance, LiPA sensitivity was 90% and specificity was 100%. Molecular analysis of possible false-negative isolates by LiPA revealed an absence of mutations in the rpoB gene. RMP resistance was a good proxy for MDR-TB, as 66 (93%) of 71. RMP-resistant isolates were also isoniazid-resistant. CONCLUSION: The LiPA provided rapid results that were highly predictive of RMP resistance and MDR-TB. False-negatives occurred, but only among isolates with mutations in regions not assessed by LiPA. Performance and cost-effectiveness should be evaluated in patients during routine program conditions.

pub-1627	Drug-resistant tuberculosis in Shanghai, China, 2000-2006: prevalence, trends and risk factors	SETTING: During 2000-2006, a regional anti-tuberculosis drug resistance surveillance study was conducted in Shanghai, China. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence, trends and risk factors for drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in Shanghai, China. DESIGN: A retrospective study of all pulmonary TB patients reported in Shanghai during 2000-2006 was conducted. RESULTS: Of 8419 pulmonary TB patients, 16.6% had resistance to any first-line anti-tuberculosis drug and 4.0% had multidrug resistance (MDR). The percentage of TB patients with resistance to any first-line anti-tuberculosis drug and MDR significantly increased during 2000-2003 (P = 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively). After Improvements in the TB control programme in 2004, the increasing trend in drug resistance was contained. Age 30-59 years, being an urban migrant and residence in an urban area of Shanghai were independently associated with resistance to any first-line drug and MDR in new cases, while age 30-59 years and being an urban migrant were independently associated with resistance to any first-line drug and MDR in previously treated cases. CONCLUSIONS: Drug-resistant TB and MDR-TB pose a challenge for TB control in Shanghai. Improved case management, including DOTS and appropriate treatment regimens, should be sustained to prevent further transmission and development of drug-resistant TB in this setting.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; MDR-TB; epidemiology	NEW-YORK-CITY; TRANSMISSION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; SURVEILLANCE
pub-1628	Drug susceptibility test of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by nitrate reductase assay	Background: Drug susceptibility testing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) is especially required in difficult cases of tuberculosis (TB) chemotherapy and in cases of multidrug resistance (MDR-TB; combined resistance to isonizid and rifampicin with or without resistance to any other drug). The methods for in vitro cultivation and drug susceptibility testing (DST) of M. tuberculosis are cumbersome and not readily adaptable in most routine laboratories, particularly those in the developing world due to limited resources and lack of political will in those countries. A simple and cost effective method, the nitrate reductase assay (NRA), was compared with the gold standard proportion (egg bases Lowenstein Jensen's [LJ]) method for DST of M. tuberculosis in order to substantiate its suitability for routine use in Nigeria and in other countries of the developing world with high TB endemicity. Method: Drug susceptibility test was performed for 70 pulmonary isolates of M tuberculosis (Indirect DST) and 20 sputum (10 acid fast bacilli [AFB] positive and 10 AFB negative) specimens (direct DST) by the NRA and the proportion method using 0.2 mu g isoniazid (INH), 2 mu g ethambutol (EMB), 40 mu g rifampicin (RIF) and 4 mu g streptomycin STR). Results: The indirect NRA showed sensitivity and specificity for INH: 100% and 100%, EMB: 75% and 100% RIF: 90% and 96.6%, STR: 66.6% and 91.8%. The results of direct NRA and proportion method for INH, EMB RIF and STR agreed 10/10 (100%) for AFB negative specimens and 9/10 (90%) with AFB positive specimens. Conclusion: Drug susceptibility test of M. tuberculosis by the NRA is simple and sensitive with shorter turn around time of 10 to 1 4 days compared to 42 days by the LJ proportion method. The direct use of AFB positive sputum specimens is likewise reproducible and excludes about 3-8 weeks period required for isolation of M. tuberculosis.

10.1186_1471_2350_10_2	A rapid method for detection of five known mutations associated with aminoglycoside-induced deafness	Background: South Africa has one of the highest incidences of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the world. Concomitantly, aminoglycosides are commonly used in this country as a treatment against MDR-TB. To date, at least five mutations are known to confer susceptibility to aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss. The aim of the present study was to develop a rapid screening method to determine whether these mutations are present in the South African population. Methods: A multiplex method using the SNaPshot technique was used to screen for five mutations in the MT-RNRI gene: AI555G, CI494T, TI095C, 961deIT+C(n) and A827G. A total of 204 South African control samples, comprising 98 Mixed ancestry and 106 Black individuals were screened for the presence of the five mutations. Results: A robust, cost-effective method was developed that detected the presence of all five sequence variants simultaneously. In this pilot study, the AI555G mutation was identified at a frequency of 0.9% in the Black control samples. The 961deIT+C(n) variant was present in 6.6% of the Black controls and 2% of the Mixed ancestry controls. The TI095C, CI494T and A827G variants were not identified in any of the study participants. Conclusion: The frequency of 0.9% for the AI555G mutation in the Black population in South Africa is of concern given the high incidence of MDR-TB in this particular ethnic group. Future larger studies are warranted to determine the true frequencies of the aminoglycoside deafness mutations in the general South African population. The high frequencies of the 961deIT+C(n) variant observed in the controls suggest that this change is a common non-pathogenic polymorphism. This genetic method facilitates the identification of individuals at high risk of developing hearing loss prior to the start of aminoglycoside therapy. This is important in a low-resource country like South Africa where, despite their adverse side-effects, aminoglycosides will continue to be used routinely and are accompanied with very limited or no audiological monitoring.

10.1159_000226425	Differences in Cell Wall Thickness between Resistant and Nonresistant Strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: Using Transmission Electron Microscopy	The ultrastructure of the cell wall of extensively drug-resistant (XDR), multidrug-resistant (MDR) and susceptible tuberculosis ( TB) bacilli was viewed under transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Under the TEM, marked differences were observed in the thickness of their cell wall: 20.2 +/- 1.5 and 17.1 +/- 1.03 nm for the XDR and MDR TB bacilli, respectively, and 15.6 +/- 1.3 nm for the susceptible isolates (p < 0.05). In MDR bacilli, thickening of the cell wall was observed in the intermediate electron-transparent layer (ETL) and outer electron-opaque layer, whereas in XDR TB cells the basal peptidoglycan layer was denser and almost fused with the ETL. Five to seven percent of XDR TB bacilli had the appearance of the stationary phase with cell wall thickness ranging from 21 to 26 nm (p < 0.001). Information provided in this study is of significant importance in terms of drug selection for effective treatment of resistant strains. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

10.1111_j.1742_4658.2008.06763.x	A novel inhibitor of indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase with activity against multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The increasing emergence and spread of drug-resistant TB poses a significant threat to disease control and calls for the urgent development of new drugs. The tryptophan biosynthetic pathway plays an important role in the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Thus, indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS), as an essential enzyme in this pathway, might be a potential target for anti-TB drug design. In this study, we deduced the structure of IGPS of M. tuberculosis H37Rv by using homology modeling. On the basis of this deduced IGPS structure, screening was performed in a search for novel inhibitors, using the Maybridge database containing the structures of 60 000 compounds. ATB107 was identified as a potential binding molecule; it was tested, and shown to have antimycobacterial activity in vitro not only against the laboratory strain M. tuberculosis H37Rv, but also against clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant TB strains. Most MDR-TB strains tested were susceptible to 1 mu g.mL(-1) ATB107. ATB107 had little toxicity against THP-1 macrophage cells, which are human monocytic leukemia cells. ATB107, which bound tightly to IGPS in vitro, was found to be a potent competitive inhibitor of the substrate 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxyribulose-5'-phosphate, as shown by an increased K-m value in the presence of ATB107. The results of site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that ATB107 might inhibit IGPS activity by reducing the binding affinity for substrate of residues Glu168 and Asn189. These results suggest that ATB107 is a novel potent inhibitor of IGPS, and that IGPS might be a potential target for the development of new anti-TB drugs. Further evaluation of ATB107 in animal studies is warranted.	drug resistance; indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase; inhibitor; Mycobacterium tuberculosis	DRUG DESIGN; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; AUTOMATED DOCKING; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; ENZYME; SIMULATIONS; ALGORITHM; SUBSTRATE; PROTEINS; MODELS
10.1093_heapol_czn045	Reforming tuberculosis control in Ukraine: results of pilot projects and implications for the national scale-up of DOTS	The period of economic transition has had severe consequences for health and health systems in Ukraine. The tuberculosis (TB) situation illustrates this. The strategy recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for TB, directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS), has the potential to provide real improvements in TB services, forming the basis of the response to the growing epidemic. In 2002, Ukraine, financially supported by USAID and the European Community (EC), began to introduce DOTS through pilot projects in Mariupol and Kyiv City. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility, effectiveness, health service cost, patient cost, and the cost-effectiveness of these pilots, in order to inform the national scale-up of DOTS. The study finds that DOTS is feasible and has the potential to be both effective and cost-effective in Ukraine. Following this study, Ukraine adopted DOTS as a national TB control strategy in 2005. However, the pilots also found that there are several evidence-related concerns and perverse economic incentives to both providers and patients that will need to be addressed if national scale-up is to be successful. These include concerns related to the treatment of MDR-TB, economic benefits to some patients to remain hospitalized, and payments to providers and health facilities that support current practices. These will need to be addressed if Ukraine is to develop an effective response to its emerging TB epidemic.		COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS; RUSSIAN-FEDERATION; HIV
10.1016_j.ijid.2008.03.025	Rapid speciation of 15 clinically relevant mycobacteria with simultaneous detection of resistance to rifampin, isoniazid, and streptomycin in Mycobocterium tuberculosis complex	Objective: To design and standardize an in-house reverse line blot hybridization (RLBH) assay for the accurate identification of 15 clinically relevant species of mycobacteria and for the detection of drug resistance to rifampin (RIF), isoniazid (INH), and streptomycin (STR) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB). Material and methods: Oligonucleotides specific for 15 different species of mycobacteria and wild type and mutant alleles of selected codons in the rpo beta, inhA. katG, rpsL, and rrs genes were designed and immobilized on a membrane. A multiplex PCR was standardized to amplify all. target genes. The assay was optimized using ATCC and known mutant strains. Three hundred MTB isolates, 85 non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) isolates, and 48 smear-positive specimens were analyzed. Results were confirmed by PCR restriction enzyme assay and sequencing. Results: Upon RLBH analysis, among the NTM, 14% were identified as Mycobacterium fortuitum, 16% were identified as Mycobacterium abscessus, 20% showed 99% homology with Mycobacterium intracellulare, and 31% showed 98% homology with Mycobacterium simiae. Of the 300 MTB isolates analyzed, 75% RIF-resistant isolates had Ser531Leu mutation in the rpo beta gene. Of the IN H resistant isolates, 89% showed Ser315Thr mutation in the katG gene, whereas 16% showed -15 C -> T mutation in the promoter region of the inhA gene. Among STR-resistant isolates, 75% had A -> G mutation in the rpsL gene at codon 43. RLBH results showed 96-99% concordance with phenotypic culture results. Conclusion: This is a first attempt at combining speciation with detection of drug resistance to RIF, INH, and STR in MTB for accurate and rapid management of mycobacterial infections as well as for compiling genotypic epidemiological data.

pub-1637	Evolution in the resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to anti-tuberculosis drugs in Nicaragua	SETTING: Nicaragua, a country where the DOTS strategy has been successfully implemented since 1984. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and trends of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. DESIGN: A prospective national survey carried out In 2004 according to the standardised model developed by the World Health Organisation and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. RESULTS: A total of 423 M. tuberculosis strains were studied. Among the 320 strains evaluated for initial resistance, 13.1% displayed resistance to any drug, lower than the 1998 figure of 15.6%. Overall Initial resistance to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP) and multidrug resistance (MDR) was respectively 6.6%, 0.9% and 0.6%. Initial resistance was higher in older age groups. Overall acquired resistance was 35.9% (n = 103); resistance to INH was 29.3% and to RMP 8.9%, while MDR was 7.9%. The acquired MDR rate was clearly higher in Category I failures (44.4%) than in relapses (3.8%) and retrieved defaulters (2.7%). All resistance rates found in this study were lower than those detected in 1998. CONCLUSION: This study shows low rates of resistance and MDR and a downward trend in all rates, undoubtedly related to the proper implementation of the National Tuberculosis Programme.

pub-1638	Prevalence and risk factors for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the Republic of Georgia: a population-based study	SETTING: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB, defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin) has emerged as a serious global public health problem, especially in the former Soviet republics. The extent of the problem in Georgia has been incompletely defined. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and risk factors for MDR-TB in Georgia. DESIGN: A population-based study was carried out between July 2005 and May 2006. RESULTS: Of 1314 patients with acid-fast bacilli smear-and culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), 799 (60.8%) were newly diagnosed patients and 515 (39.2%) had been treated previously. Overall, 733 (56%) patients had resistance to at least one anti-tuberculosis drug and 195 (15%) had MDR-TB. Patients who had been treated previously for TB were significantly more likely to have MDR-TB than newly diagnosed patients (141/515 [27.4%] vs. 54/794 [6.8%], OR 5.27, 95%CI 3.75-7.41). In multivariate analysis, previous TB treatment (aOR 5.47, 95%CI 3.87-7.74) and female sex (aOR 1.58, 95%CI 1.02-2.32) were independent risk factors for the presence of MDR-TB. CONCLUSIONS: Drug-resistant TB, including MDR-TB, has emerged as a major public health problem in Georgia. Further TB control efforts need to be implemented to prevent the development of new cases of MDR-TB and to treat existing patients with MDR-TB.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; MDR-TB; Drug Resistance Survey; Georgia	HIV
pub-1639	Acquired drug resistance pattern in tuberculosis cases at the State Tuberculosis Centre, Delhi, India	SETTING: State TB Demonstration Centre, Delhi, India. OBJECTIVE: To obtain a baseline estimate of the prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) among previously treated tuberculosis (TB) cases at the State Tuberculosis Centre in 2006. DESIGN: A retrospective study. Drug susceptibility data of 5252 previously treated patients tested at this centre were analysed. RESULTS: Of 2880 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from previously treated cases, 1498 (52%) were resistant to one or more anti-tuberculosis drugs, of which 47.1% were MDR. Resistance to isoniazid was observed in all resistant isolates, followed by resistance to rifampicin in 1357 (47.1%), streptomycin in 403 (14.2%) and ethambutol in 107 (3.72%). A significantly higher rate of resistance, including MDR, was observed among treatment failures compared to relapses and defaulters. CONCLUSION: A very high proportion of drug-resistant cases had MDR besides resistance to two or more drugs. This proportion was significantly higher among treatment failures compared to relapses and treatment after default cases, underlining the need for early identification of treatment failure by early referral for culture and drug susceptibility testing, and initiation of appropriate treatment.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; previously treated	FAILURE
10.1590_S1806_37132009000100008	Clinical evolution of a group of patients with multidrug-resistant TB treated at a referral center in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil	Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics and evolution of a group of patients with positive sputum cultures for multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis and treated at a referral center in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Methods: Based on the positive results in sputum cultures for MDR M. tuberculosis, 50 patients were selected, and their clinical data were obtained from the Brazilian Ministry of Health MDR-TB Database. The frequencies of noncompliance, relapses, failures and previous treatments for TB up to diagnosis of MDR-TB were compiled. The radiological patterns were classified as unilateral or bilateral, and with or without cavitation. Two years after the end of the standard treatment for MDR-TB, the outcome (cure, failure, noncompliance or death) for each patient was evaluated and reassessed every two years. The post-treatment follow-up period was eight years. Results: The mean number of previous treatments was 2.3 +/- 0.9. The mean interval between the initial diagnosis and the development of MDR-TB was 2.0 +/- 1.7 years. Two years after the initial treatment for MDR-TB, 2 patients had abandoned treatment, 8 had died, 18 had been cured, and 22 had presented treatment failure. The bivariate analysis showed that bilateral pulmonary involvement and cavitary pattern markedly reduced the chances for cure, with a relative risk of 1-0.6 (40%) and 1-0.7 (30%), respectively. At the end of the follow-up period, 2 patients had abandoned treatment, 9 had presented treatment failure, 17 had been Cured, and 22 had died. Conclusions: Bilateral pulmonary involvement and cavity pattern greatly reduced the chances for cure of the patients with MDR-TB. Most patients who presented treatment failure died within the 8-year follow-up period.

10.1080_00365540802298079	Is standardized treatment appropriate for non-XDR multiple drug resistant tuberculosis cases? A clinical descriptive study	The clinical relevance of second-line drug susceptibility test (DST) results with respect to treatment outcome is unknown in non-XDR MDR patients. This study was carried out in the sole national referral centre for TB in Iran between 2002 and 2006. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients who had DST to second-line drugs were included. For all MDR-TB patients the standard second-line regimen was initiated. Outcome of treatment based on DST to second-line drugs was analysed. 53 patients were included. DST for second-line drugs was available for 40 patients. Seven patients returned to Afghanistan during treatment. Among the remainder, 13 (30.4%) cases were Iranian. Mean age was 40.8 + 19.7 y. The relatively small sample size imposes some limitations on this study. However, in this study, there was no difference in resistance to second-line drugs by nationality. No significant correlation was seen between resistance to second-line drugs and outcome of treatment. In conclusion, the treatment outcome according to WHO definitions was appropriate in the study population by the use of standardized treatment regimens. Follow-up studies on a long-term basis are however needed in order to detect possible relapses.		HIV-INFECTION; THERAPY; MANAGEMENT; COHORT; IRAN; PERU; TB
10.1177_1403494808097172	Evaluation of tuberculosis control programme in Khartoum State for the year 2006	Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is among the top ten causes of global mortality. Sudan is among the countries with high TB prevalence; with an estimated incidence of 90/100,000 smear-positive cases. In 1993, the Khartoum State tuberculosis control programme was established. Since its establishment, however, the programme has never been adequately assessed. Aim: To evaluate and describe the tuberculosis control programme in Khartoum State, Sudan in 2006; to find out if the programme achieved its global targeted goals; and to identify the challenges and needs for performing a good standard tuberculosis control programme. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional and retrospective study design was used. The study population was tuberculosis control departments at the levels of the state (n = 1), localities (n = 7), health areas (n = 19) and health facilities (n = 42). Records review and group interviews were used to collect the required data. Results: The study found that the TB control programme in Khartoum State achieved a 77.2% case detection rate of the smear-postive cases, and 73.5% treatment success rate, and a case fatality rate of 2.2%, treatment failure rate of 2.2%, and default rate of 14.1%. There was no system to detect the prevalence of MDR-TB (multi-drug resistant TB) or HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) among the TB cases. The programme was not well implemented at locality or health area levels. Conversely, drugs and laboratory supply systems were functioning well. Conclusions: The tuberculosis control programme in Khartoum State is centralized, not updated, and does not achieve the targeted goals.

pub-1643	ANTI-TUBERCULOSIS DRUG RESISTANCE AND HIV CO-INFECTION IN PHNOM PENH, CAMBODIA	The objective of this study was to observe the prevalence of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in HIV associated tuberculosis co-infected patients in Phnom Penh City. The isolates of M. tuberculosis were collected during active laboratory-based surveillance. Of the 98 isolates studied, M. tuberculosis resistance to isoniazid was seen in 23.5%, resistance to rifampicin was seen in 16.3% and multidrug-resistance (MDR-TB) was seen in 5.1%. Our findings reveal an alarmingly high level of resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin, and confirms the need for drug susceptibility testing to guide treatment in patients with culture positive tuberculosis.		
10.1186_1471_2334_8_166	Prevalence of tuberculosis drug resistance in 10 provinces of China	Background: The emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) hampers TB control. Ten provinces in China performed drug resistance surveys among tuberculosis (TB) patients in 1996 2004 to assess levels of drug resistance. Methods: Provincial drug resistance surveys included all isolates from newly diagnosed, smear-positive TB patients. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) against isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin and ethambutol was carried out in the provincial laboratories. For purposes of quality assurance, a random sample (11.6%) was re-tested by the national reference laboratory (NRL). Results: Of 14,059 patients tested 11,052 (79%) were new TB cases. The weighted mean prevalence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) among all cases was 9.3% (range 2.2% 10.4%); 5.4% (range 2.1%-10.4%) among new cases and 25.6% (range 11.7%-36.9%) among previously treated cases. Adjusting the drug resistance proportions using the re-testing results did not change the estimated national mean prevalence significantly. However, in some individual provinces the estimated resistance proportions were greatly influenced, especially among re-treatment patients. Conclusion: MDR-TB levels varied greatly between provinces in China, but on average were high compared to the global estimated average of 4.8%. This study shows the importance of quality-assured laboratory performance. Programmatic management of drug-resistant TB, including high quality DST for patients at high risk of resistance and treatment with second-line drugs, should become the standard, especially in high MDR-TB settings.		
pub-1645	Rapid detection of rifampicin and isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis by the direct thin-layer agar method	We evaluated thin-layer agar (TLA) for the detection of resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to rifampicin (RMP) and isoniazid (INH) as a direct method in patients at risk of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB). Quadrant TLA plates contain 7H10 Middlebrook growth control, para-nitrobenzoic acid, INH and RMP. Detection of RMP and INH resistance by TLA was compared to that in indirect conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST) and conventional culture media. Median time for growth was respectively 22, 10 and 7.6 days for Lowenstein-Jensen,TLA and the Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube. TLA sensitivity, specificity and predictive values for RMP and INH resistance were 100%. Time to resistance detection was respectively 11. and 11.5 days for RMP and INH. TLA showed a rapid turnaround time and performance comparable to conventional DST methods.	MDR-TB; drug susceptibility testing; rapid DST	
10.3103_S0891416808040083	Frequency of occurrence and types of mutations in the rpoB, katG, inhA, and ahpC genes associated with rifampicin and isoniasid resistance in M-tuberculosis strains circulating in the Kyrgyz Republic	The availability of an MDR TB-Biochip for the express detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) strains resistant to rifampicin and isoniasid has been studied in 940 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. The rpoB gene of rifampicin-resistant MBT strains circulating in the Kyrgyz Republic was shown to have substitutions at codons 531, 526, 516, 511, 513, 512, 533, and 522. MBT strains with mutations at codons 531 and 526 are prevalent. Among all rifampicin-resistant strains, MBT strains with the mutation of Ser531 -> Leu occurred most frequently (59.7%). Isoniasid resistance is determined by mutations in the katG (94.5%), inhA (3.5%), and ahpC (1%) genes. Among isoniasid-resistant MBT strains, those with the mutation of Ser315 -> Thr315 (94%) in the katG gene codon are predominant.		
10.1164_rccm.200801_132OC	Treatment Outcomes and Long-term Survival in Patients with Extensively Drug-resistant Tuberculosis	Rationale: The increasing worldwide incidence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has emerged as a threat to public health and tuberculosis (TB) control. Treatment outcomes have varied among studies, and data on long-term survival are still scarce. Objectives: To retrospectively assess the burden, clinical characteristics, treatment outcomes, and long-term survival rate of patients with XDR-TB in a cohort of patients with HIV-negative multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in South Korea. Methods: Medical records were reviewed of patients newly diagnosed with or retreated for MDR-TB from 2000 to 2002. The cohort was monitored for 3 to 7 years after the initiation of treatment. Initial treatment outcomes and cumulative survival rates were analyzed, and predictors of treatment success and survival were defined. Measurements and Main Results: Of 1,407 patients with MDR-TB 75 (5.3%) had XDR-TB at treatment initiation. The default rate was high (453/1,407; 32%), and patients with XDR-TB had lower treatment success (29.3 vs. 46.2%; P = 0.004) and higher all-cause (49.3 vs. 19.4%; P < 0.001) and TB-related disease mortality (41.3 vs. 11.8%; P<0.001) than other patients with MDR-TB. The presence of XDR-TB significantly affected treatment success (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08-0.64; P = 0.005), all-cause mortality (hazards ratio, 3.25; 95% Cl, 1.91-5.53; P < 0.001), and TB-related mortality (hazards ratio, 4.45; 95% Cl, 2.48-8.00; P < 0.001) on multivariate analyses. Conclusions: XDR-TB occurred in a substantial proportion of patients with MDR-TB in South Korea, and was the strongest predictor of treatment outcomes and long-term survival in patients with MDR-TB. Adequate TB control policies should be implemented to prevent the further development and spread of drug resistance.	tuberculosis; extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis; tuberculosis survival rate; treatment efficacy; South Korea	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; SOUTH-KOREA; EPIDEMIOLOGY; SURVEILLANCE; AFRICA; RISK
10.1016_j.athoracsur.2008.07.056	Pulmonary Resection in the Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis: A Retrospective Study of 56 Cases	Background. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has become a challenge to TB control, and surgical resection is regaining its status as an integral component of multimodal treatment. We evaluated the efficacy and risks of pulmonary resection in the treatment of MDR-TB. Methods. A retrospective review was performed of 56 patients who had undergone pulmonary resection for MDR-TB from January 1995 to July 2006. Preoperative diagnoses included cavitation in 25 patients, lung destruction in 17, endobronchial TBs in 10, and tuberculoma in 4. Results. Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin was isolated from the sputum of all patients preoperatively but in only 5 patients postoperatively. Pneumonectomy was performed on 25 patients and lobectomy on 31. No patients died perioperatively, but major complications occurred in 14 patients, with a morbidity of 25%. Complications included reoperation due to uncontrollable postoperative bleeding in 1 patient, chylothorax in 1, wound infection in 1, bronchopleural fistula in 9, and chronic tuberculous empyema in 2. Analysis of variance showed that lung function was significantly correlated with the type of preoperative diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that endobronchial TB significantly contributed to the development of bronchopleural fistula, and bronchial stump reinforcement could prevent its occurrence. Conclusions. Pulmonary resection plays an important role in the treatment of MDR-TB. Endobronchial TB is a significant risk factor for developing bronchopleural fistula, but bronchial stump reinforcement can effectively prevent its occurrence.		PNEUMONECTOMY; SURGERY
10.3201_eid1411.080729	Multidrug- and Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis, Germany	We evaluated risk factors and treatment outcomes associated with multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) in Germany in 2004-2006. In 177 (4%) of 4,557 culture-positive TB cases, Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were identified as MDR TB, an additional 7 (0.15%) met criteria for XDR TB. Of these 184 patients, 148 (80%) were born in countries of the former Soviet Union. In patients with XDR TB, hospitalization was longer (mean +/- SD 202 +/- 130 vs. 123 +/- 81 days; p = 0.015) and resistance to all first-line drugs was more frequent (36% vs. 86%; p = 0.013) than in patients with MDR TB. Seventy-four (40%) of these 184 patients received treatment with linezolid. Treatment success rates ranged from 59% for the entire cohort (59% for MDR TB and 57% for XDR TB) to 87% for those with a definitive outcome (n = 125; 89% for MDR TB and 80% for XDR TB). Extensive drug susceptibility testing and availability of second- and third-line drugs under inpatient management conditions permit relatively high treatment success rates in MDR and XDR TB.

10.3201_eid1411.071629	Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Outbreak among US-bound Hmong Refugees, Thailand, 2005	In January 2005, tuberculosis (TB), including multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB), was reported among Hmong refugees who were living in or had recently immigrated to the United States from a camp in Thailand. We investigated TB and drug resistance, enhanced TB screenings, and expanded treatment capacity in the camp. In February 2005, 272 patients with TB (24 MDR TB) remained in the camp. Among 17 MDR TB patients interviewed, 13 were found to be linked socially. Of 23 MDR TB isolates genotyped, 20 were similar according to 3 molecular typing methods. Before enhanced screening was implemented, 46 TB cases (6 MDR TB) were diagnosed in the United States among 9,455 resettled refugees. After enhanced screening had begun, only 4 TB cases (1 MDR TB), were found among 5,705 resettled refugees. An MDR TB outbreak among US-bound refugees led to importation of disease; enhanced pre-immigration TB screening and treatment decreased subsequent importation.

pub-1651	Novel-mutations in emb B gene of ethambutol resistant isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: A preliminary report	Background & objectives: Ethambutol (EMB) resistance, thought to be occurring due to mutations in embB gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis on the rise is a cause of grave concern. The present study was planned to investigate the presence of EMB resistance in M. tuberculosis isolates and to look for prevalent mutations in embB gene. Methods: A total of 591(283 from new and 308 from previously treated cases) sputum samples from the same number of pulmonary tuberculosis cases were cultured. Isolates were tested by I per cent proportion method for resistance to isoniazid; rifampicin streptomycin and ethambutol. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of EMB was measured by absolute concentration method. Ten randomly selected isolates were subjected to single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and direct DNA sequencing to look for mutation in 364 bp segments of embB gene. Results: Of 353 isolates of M. tuberculosis from 591 sputum samples, 62 (17.58%) were resistant to EMB, of which, 16 (25.8%) showed initial resistance and 46 (74.2%) acquired. Mono resistance to EMB was rare. Only two isolates showed resistance to EMB alone. From 62 EMB resistant isolates, 88.7 per cent (55) were resistant to INH, 82.2 per cent (51) to rifampicin and 61.2 per cent (38) were resistant to streptomycin. Co-resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin (multidrug resistant, MDR-TB) with EMB resistance was seen in 41(66.1%) isolates. High level of EMB resistance was seen in 16.5 per cent isolates. SSCP showed altered mobility in 8 of 10 isolates tested. Among the 8 mutants, 4 had known mutations at codon Met 306 being replaced by Val/ Leu. The second most frequent mutation encountered was at codon Phe 287 being replaced by Val, Cys or Len (novel mutations). Sequence analysis revealed 10 novel mutations in codon 221, 225, 227, 271, 272, 281, 282, 287, 293 and 294 within embB gene. Interpretation & conclusions: Presence of high frequency of EMB resistance, occurrence of high level EMB resistance, co-existence of MDR-TB with EMB resistance and novel mutations in emb B gene of M. tuberculosis clinical isolates reported highlight the need to work on larger samples to identify the diagnostic marker of EMB resistance in mycobacteria.

10.1016_j.ijid.2008.03.012	High prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Georgia	Background: Tuberculosis (TB) has emerged as a serious public health problem in the country of Georgia. However, little or no data exist on rates and risk factors for drug-resistant TB, including multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB, in Georgia. Objective: To assess the prevalence and risk factors for drug-resistant TB. Methods: A cross-sectional. prospective survey of patients with suspected pulmonary TB was carried out at four sentinel sites (Tbilisi, Zugdidi, Kutaisi, and Batumi) in Georgia between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2004. Results: Among 1422 patients with suspected pulmonary TB, 996 (70.0%) were culture positive; 931/996 (93.5%) had drug susceptibility testing performed. Overall, 64.0% of patients (48.3% of new and 85.3% of retreatment cases) had positive cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to >= 1 first-line antituberculosis drugs. The overall prevalence of MDR-TB was 28.1% (10.5% of newly diagnosed patients and 53.1% of retreatment cases). In multivariate analysis, risk factors for MDR-TB included: being a retreatment case (prevalence ratio (PR) = 5.28, 95% CI 3.95-7.07), history of injection drug use (PR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.21-2.09), and female gender (PR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.12-1.65). Conclusions: MDR-TB has emerged as a serious public health problem in Georgia and will greatly impact TB control strategies. (C) 2008 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

pub-1653	Second-line drug resistance in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cases of various origins in the Netherlands	SETTING: The Netherlands. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of resistance to second-line drugs among niultidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases and its correlation with patients' geographic origin. DESIGN: Retrospective laboratory database study of multitidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains isolated in the Netherlands between January 1993 and October 2007. RESULTS: We found 153 patients with MDR-TB, of whom 18 (12%) were native Dutch. Complete second-line drug susceptibility testing was performed for 131 MDR-TB patients. Resistance to second-line drugs was noted in primary samples of 28 (21%) MDR-TB patients. Resistance to a single second-line drug was most frequent (24/28 [86%]; 9 to prothionamide [PTH], 6 to para-aminosalicylic acid, 4 to amikacin [AMK], 4 to ciprofloxacin and I to cycloserine). Four MDR-TB patients had strains resistant to multiple second-line drugs; two were extensively drug-resistant M. bovis. In MDR-TB patients of European and Central Asian origin, resistance to second-line drugs was most frequent and involved the widest range of drugs. PTH resistance was frequent among African and American MDR-TB patients, while AMK resistance was frequent among South-East Asians. CONCLUSION: Resistance to second-line drugs is infrequent among MDR-TB patients in the Netherlands. Most second-line drug resistance is recorded among Immigrants, with substantial differences in second-line drug resistance in MDR-TB patients originating from different geographical areas.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; RIFAMPICIN-RESISTANT; MUTATIONS; EMERGENCE; STRAINS
pub-1654	Relationship between the isoniazid-resistant mutation katGS315T and the prevalence of MDR-/XDR-TB in Osaka, Japan	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of katGS3 15T mutations in isoniazid (INH) resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and to elucidate the association of katGS315T mutations with the prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). DESIGN: From 2001 to 2004, 1655 isolates from all newly registered patients who visited the Osaka Prefectural Medical Centre for Respiratory and Allergic Diseases were tested for drug susceptibility. Genotyping was performed using insertion sequence (IS) 61 10-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RHY) in 1629 of 1655 (98.4%) cases. All 145 isolates Of INH-resistant M. tuberculosis, including MDR strains, were tested to detect the katGS315T mutation. RESULTS: Five hundred and sixty isolates (34.4%) shared an RFLP pattern. Of the 145 INH-resistant isolates, 18/48 (37.5%) isolates belonging to the RFLP cluster had katG315T and 23/97 (23.7%) did not have the mutation. Of the 66 MDR-TB cases, 18/29 (62.1 %) Isolates belonging to the RFLP cluster had katGS315T and 11/37 (29.7%) did not have the mutation. Of the 29 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB cases, 17/21 (80.9%) Isolates belonging to the RFLP cluster had katGS315T and 3/8 (37.5%) did not have the mutation. CONCLUSION: The clustering rate by IS6110-RFLP) was very high among MDR-/XDR-TB isolates with katGS315T. Our study indicates a strong correlation between the katGS315T mutation and the transmission dynamics of MDR-TB, and especially XDR-TB.

10.1007_s12038_008_0078_8	Multidrug resistant to extensively drug resistant tuberculosis: What is next?	Drug resistant tuberculosis is a man made problem. While tuberculosis is hundred percent curable, multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is difficult to treat. Inadequate and incomplete treatment and poor treatment adherence has led to a newer form of drug resistance known as extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). XDR-TB is defined as tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain, which is resistant to at least rifampicin and isoniazid among the first line anti tubercular drugs (MDR-TB) in addition to resistance to any fluroquinolones and at least one of three injectable second line anti tubercular drugs i.e. amikacin, kanamycin and/or capreomycin. Mismanagement of tuberculosis paves the way to drug resistant tuberculosis. Emergence of XDR-TB is reported world wide. Reported prevalence rates of XDR-TB of total MDR cases are; 6.6% overall worldwide, 6.5% in industrialized countries, 13.6% in Russia and Eastern Europe, 1.5% in Asia, 0.6% in Africa and Middle East and 15.4% in Republic of Korea. Better management and control of tuberculosis specially drug resistant TB by experienced and qualified doctors, access to standard microbiology laboratory, co-morbitidy of HIV and tuberculosis, new anti-TB drug regimens, better diagnostic tests, international standards for second line drugs (SLD)-susceptibility testing, invention of newer antitubercular molecules and vaccines and knowing the real magnitude of XDR-TB are some of the important issues to be addressed for effective prevention and management of XDR-TB.

pub-1656	Comparative analysis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis - Epidemiology and predictive factors	Introduction: Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is defined as a form of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) with additional resistance to fluoroquinolones and at least one of the injectable drugs used in tuberculosis treatment: amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin. It was classified by WHO as a serious threat to tuberculosis (TB) control, with world-wide consequences, taking on the proportions of a real pandemic in some regions. Aim: To compare patients with XDR-TB versus other MDR-TB profiles with regard to epidemiological and demographic characteristics, aetiopathogenic factors and inhospital outcomes. Methods: Patients admitted to Pulido Valente Hospital (Pulmonology Service III) in the period ranging from April 1999 to June 2007 with MDR-TB diagnosis microbiologically confirmed. The following variables were evaluated: gender, age, race, forms of TB presentation, treatment groups, resistance profile, immigrant status, number and duration of previous treatments, WHO classification, HIV co-infection, alcoholism and/or drug addiction, average length of hospital stay and inhospital mortality. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), version 15.0. In categorical variables, the statistical differences between groups were evaluated by the Chi-square test and numeric variables using the T-test. Logistical regression analysis was used to build the predictive model of XDR-TB existence (dependent variable), which included the following independent variables: WHO classification, HIV co-infection, immigrant status, alcoholism and/or drug addiction and number and duration of previous treatments. Results: We recorded 132 patients with MDR-TB, of which 69 (52.3%) were XDR-TB. Statistically significant differences were observed in the following variables: race (black race was associated with XDR-TB in 74% of cases versus 46% of the Caucasian race); WHO classification (patients with retreatment for therapeutic failure, stopping treatment or relapse were 69.5% of XDR-TB cases versus 44.5% of Not XDR-TB cases; average duration of previous treatments (4.2 months for XDR-TB cases versus 2.8 months for Not XDR-TB cases); HIV co-infection (patients with HIV co-infection constituted 65.2% of XDR-TB cases versus 42.9% of Not XDR-TB cases), mortality (33.3% in patients with XDR-TB versus 14.3% in Not XDR-TB patients). Conclusions: The variables with predictive value for the diagnosis of XDR-TB vs. Not XDR-TB were presence of HIV co-infection (odds ratio [OR] for XDRTB 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24 - 5.05) and increased average cluration of previous treatments ([OR] for XDR-TB 1.2; 95% [01, 1.11 - 2.30).

10.1016_S0140_6736_08_61204_0	Treatment of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in Tomsk, Russia: a retrospective cohort study	Background Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains that cause untreatable drug-resistant disease are a threat worldwide. We describe the treatment, management, and outcomes of patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in Tomsk, Russia. Methods We undertook a retrospective cohort study of 608 patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis who had treatment in civilian or prison services, between Sept 10, 2000, and Nov 1, 2004, according to the treatment strategy recommended by WHO. Clinical characteristics, management practices, and treatment outcomes of patients with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis and non-extensively drug-resistant (non-XDR) tuberculosis are described. The main outcome was the frequency of poor and favourable outcomes at the end of treatment. Findings Of 608 patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis, 29 (4.8%) patients had baseline XDR tuberculosis. Treatment failure was more common in patients with XDR tuberculosis than in those with non-XDR tuberculosis (31% vs 8.5%, p=0.0008). 48.3% of patients with XDR tuberculosis and 66.7% of patients with non-XDR tuberculosis had treatment cure or completion (p=0.04). The frequency and management of adverse events did not differ between patients with XDR and non-XDR tuberculosis. Interpretation The chronic features of tuberculosis in these patients suggest that extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis may be acquired through previous treatments that include second-line drugs. Aggressive management of this infectious disease is feasible and can prevent high mortality rates and further transmission of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

pub-1658	Treatment outcome and follow-up of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients, West Coast/Winelands, South Africa, 1992-2002	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the treatment outcome and 2- and 5-year follow-up of patients treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) with individualized regimens. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of all MDR-TB patients starting treatment during 1992-2002. Patients were evaluated every 6 months for 2 years after treatment and at 5 years when possible. RESULTS: Over 11 years, 491 (66%) of 747 MDR-TB patients received treatment with two or more second-line drugs; 239 (49%) were cured or completed treatment, 68 (14%) died, 144 (29%) defaulted from treatment, 27 (5%) failed, 10 (2%) transferred out and 3 (< 1%) remained on treatment. Only 176 (36%) were tested for human immunodeficiency virus and 15 were positive. The proportion with a successful MDR-TB treatment outcome declined over time, while the proportion, who defaulted remained stable. Among 410 patients who had not transferred out or died, 281 (69%) had 2-year data available: 185 (66%) were cured or completed treatment, 32 (11%) were retreated for TB and 64 (23%) died. CONCLUSIONS: Under program conditions in the West Coast/Winelands District, default rates were high and treatment success rates low. Outreach strategies for MDR-TB treatment should only be implemented if adequate resources are committed to the program.	multidrug-resistant; tuberculosis; South Africa	SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT; DOTS-PLUS; MDR-TB; CAPE
pub-1659	An outbreak of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among refugees in Austria, 2005-2006	OBJECTIVE: To clarify the chain of transmission of this MDR-TB strain. DESIGN: An epidemiological case series investigation by reviewing TB notification reports and hospital discharge letters. RESULTS: The 38-year-old primary case of the MDR-TB cluster had initially been identified as a case of non-MDR pulmonary TB in June 2004, 7 months after being detained for illegal immigration. In March 2005, he was lost to follow-up for 4 months. In June 2005, he pre-sented with pulmonary and laryngeal TB due to MDR-TB. After discharge, the case was again lost to follow-up until April 2006, when he was readmitted with recurrent MDR-TB. A three-case cluster of pulmonary MDR-TB sharing the same strain as the primary case was detected in April 2006: the index case's 5-month-old daughter and a 25-year-old friend with a 6-month-old son. CONCLUSION: As MDR-TB has originated in the human immunodeficiency virus seronegative community in Austria, there is a clear need to implement national guidelines for the management of drug-resistant TB in Austria.	outbreak; multidrug-resistant; tuberculosis; spoligotyping; MIRU	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; TRANSMISSION; SURVEILLANCE; NETHERLANDS; MULTICENTER; DRUGS
10.1128_JCM.00973_08	Pyrazinamide resistance among South African multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates	Pyrazinamide is important in tuberculosis treatment, as it is bactericidal to semidormant mycobacteria not killed by other antituberculosis drugs. Pyrazinamide is also one of the cornerstone drugs retained in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). However, due to technical difficulties, routine drug susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis for pyrazinamide is, in many laboratories, not performed. The objective of our study was to generate information on pyrazinamide susceptibility among South African MDR and susceptible M. tuberculosis isolates from pulmonary tuberculosis patients. Seventy-one MDR and 59 fully susceptible M. tuberculosis isolates collected during the national surveillance study (2001 to 2002, by the Medical Research Council, South Africa) were examined for pyrazinamide susceptibility by the radiometric Bactec 460 TB system, pyrazinamidase activity (by Wayne's assay), and sequencing of the pncA gene. The frequency of pyrazinamide resistance (by the Bactec system) among the MDR M. tuberculosis isolates was 37 of 71 (52.1%) and 6 of 59 (10.2%) among fully sensitive isolates. A total of 25 unique mutations in the pncA gene were detected. The majority of these were point mutations that resulted in amino acid substitutions. Twenty-eight isolates had identical mutations in the pncA gene, but could be differentiated from each other by a combination of the spoligotype patterns and 12 mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit loci. A high proportion of South African MDR M. tuberculosis isolates were resistant to pyrazinamide, suggesting an evaluation of its role in patients treated previously for tuberculosis as well as its role in the treatment of MDR-TB.

pub-1661	INVESTIGATION OF PYRAZINAMIDE RESISTANCE IN MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS CASES IN HOSPITAL OF PULMONARY DISEASES, IZMIR, TURKEY	Pyrazinamide (PZA) is one of primary drugs for antituberculous treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the rates of PZA resistance in multidrug-resistant (MDR) and susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains isolated from patients who were admitted to our hospital. MDR strains have been isolated between 2005-2007 years, and susceptible strains were chosen randomly among the collection of the strains of the same period. MTB isolates were grown in BACTEC 960 full automatized broth system (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) and Lowenstein-Jensen solid medium. Identification was done by radiometric BACTEC 460 NAP procedure. Antibiotic susceptibility testing against conventional anti-tuberculous drugs (streptomycin, isoniazide, rifampisin, etambutol) was performed by the radiometric BACTEC 460 system and PZA susceptibility was worked out by BID MGIT 960 PZA Kit (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) with the use of 100.0 mu g/ml critical concentrations of PZA. As a result, two of the 65 (3.1%) MTB susceptible strains and 16 of 63 (25.4%) MDR-MTB isolates were found resistant to PZA. In conclusion, due to the high PZA resistance rate in MDR-MTB isolates, susceptibility testing against PZA should be done in MDR-TB cases; however, since PZA resistance rate was low in new susceptible cases, it was thought that testing susceptibility of PZA is not necessary as a routine procedure in our region.

Treatment of children with second-line TB drugs is complicated by potential toxicities of these agents. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of children < 15 years of age treated for MDR-TB or MDR-latent TB infection (LTBI) from 1995 to 2003. We reviewed the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) computerized TB registry to characterize demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, treatment, and outcomes of the study subjects. Results: Twenty subjects with MDR-TB (mean age 2.7 years) and 51 with MDR-LTBI (mean age 9.8 years) were studied. The most commonly used second-line TB drugs were cycloserine, quinolone agents, and ethionamide, which were used in 70%, 69%, and 54% of subjects, respectively. Sixteen (80%) of 20 MDR-TB and 38 (75%) of 51 MDR-LTBI cases completed treatment. A greater proportion of subjects receiving care at a DOH clinic completed treatment for LTBI (36/41, 88%), when compared with subjects treated at non-DOH sites [(2/9, 22%) P < 0.001]. Review of the TB registry indicated that no subjects had recurrent disease or progression of LTBI to active disease during the study period and for 2 years thereafter. Conclusions: Children with MDR-TB and LTBI were best cared for in public health settings. A multicenter registry for pediatric MDR-TB and MDR-LTBI would be desirable to obtain accurate rates of toxicity and cure.	multi drug-resistance; tuberculosis; latent TB infection; pediatrics; New York City	COMMUNITY-BASED THERAPY; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; CLINICAL-FEATURES; HIV-INFECTION; UNITED-STATES; CHILDREN; SAFETY; TB; EPIDEMIOLOGY; LIMA

Methods From September 2006 to August 2007, we collected uniform data about TB cases and enhanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) counselling and testing. We provided mycobacterial culture and drug-susceptibility testing in public or non-governmental organization facilities. Patients were classified by nationality and, for non-Thais, by migration status. Results Of 1662 TB cases in the 12-month period, 1087 (65%) occurred in non-Thais. Of non-Thais, 415 (38%) lived in Myanmar but crossed the border for healthcare. HIV infection was diagnosed in 18% of Thais compared with 12% of non-Thais (P < 0.01); HIV status was unknown for 22% of Thais and 27% of non-Thais (P = 0.02). Overall, multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB was diagnosed in 27 patients, 19 (70%) in non-Thais. Among TB cases never previously treated for TB, no MDR cases were diagnosed in Thais or in Myanmar refugees, but six cases were diagnosed in migrants from Myanmar. Conclusions In Thailand, TB, HIV-associated TB and MDR TB in migrants from Myanmar are important public health problems; they need to be resolved in both the countries.	tuberculosis; Thailand; Myanmar; default; HIV/AIDS; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis

10.1371_journal.pone.0003173	Rapid Molecular Detection of Rifampicin Resistance Facilitates Early Diagnosis and Treatment of Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis: Case Control Study	Background: Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major public health concern since diagnosis is often delayed, increasing the risk of spread to the community and health care workers. Treatment is prolonged, and the total cost of treating a single case is high. Diagnosis has traditionally relied upon clinical suspicion, based on risk factors and culture with sensitivity testing, a process that can take weeks or months. Rapid diagnostic molecular techniques have the potential to shorten the time to commencing appropriate therapy, but have not been put to the test under field conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings: This retrospective case-control study aimed to identify risk factors for MDR-TB, and analyse the impact of testing for rifampicin resistance using RNA polymerase B (rpoB) mutations as a surrogate for MDR-TB. Forty two MDR-TB cases and 84 fully sensitive TB controls were matched by date of diagnosis; and factors including demographics, clinical presentation, microbiology findings, management and outcome were analysed using their medical records. Conventionally recognised risk factors for MDR-TB were absent in almost half (43%) of the cases, and 15% of cases were asymptomatic. A significant number of MDR-TB cases were identified in new entrants to the country. Using rpoB mutation testing, the time to diagnosis of MDR-TB was dramatically shortened by a median of 6 weeks, allowing patients to be commenced on appropriate therapy a median of 51 days earlier than those diagnosed by conventional culture and sensitivity testing. Conclusions/Significance: MDR-TB is frequently an unexpected finding, may be asymptomatic, and is particularly prevalent among TB infected new entrants to the country. Molecular resistance testing of all acid fast bacilli positive specimens has the potential to rapidly identify MDR-TB patients and commence them on appropriate therapy significantly earlier than by conventional methods.		
10.3201_eid1409.061524	Underreported threat of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Africa	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) in Africa may be more prevalent than previously appreciated. Factors leading to development of drug resistance need to be understood to develop appropriate control strategies for national programs. We gathered estimates of MDR TB rates for 39 of 46 countries in Africa. The relationship between MDR TB rates and independent factors was analyzed by using correlation and linear regression models. Our findings indicate that drug resistance surveys in Africa are critically needed. MDR TB rates must be assessed in countries without these surveys. In countries that have conducted a drug resistance survey, a new survey will determine evolution of drug resistance rates. We found no correlation between high MDR rates and TB incidence, HIV/TB co-infection rates, or year of introduction of rifampin. Results show that the retreatment failure rate was the most predictive indicator for MDR TB. Current category II drug regimens may increase MDR TB.

pub-1667	Prevalence of multidrug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh	Background & objectives: Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates may be transmitted within communities due to dense population and poor hygienic conditions. For proper management and control of MDR-TB, understanding drug susceptibility pattern of M. tuberculosis isolates and their transmission pattern in every health care setting are essential. In the present study, we attempted to describe the current prevalence of MDR-TB in Lucknow district, Uttar Pradesh, and our observations on transmission of MDR isolates among populations in and around this area. Methods: Patients diagnosed as that of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) were enrolled from primary level (PLH), secondary level (SLH) and tertiary level (TLH) healthcare centres from Lucknow district. Detailed history of intake of antitubercular drug in the past was taken to decipher initial/acquired drug resistance. Sputum samples were cultured on Lowenstein- Jensen media to isolate mycobacteria. Drug susceptibility patterns of isolated M. tuberculosis isolates were recorded using I per cent proportion method. Transmission of MDR isolates in community was accessed by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Isolates showing same band pattern on RAPD were retyped using different primers targeted to the inverted repeat sequence of IS6110 copies in M. tuberculosis genome. Results: A total of 686 M. tuberculosis isolates were obtained from 1162 patients, of which 318 were front untreated subjects and 368 were front patients, who were treated for tuberculosis in the past. Prevalence of MDR was 19.8 per cent, initial and acquired being 13.2 and 25.5 per cent respectively. Prevalence of resistance to any drug, MDR and individual drug resistance to isoniazid, streptomycin, ethambutol and rifampicin was significantly higher in patients who were treated in the past. Drug resistance was significantly higher at tertiary level health care compared to primary level health care. Genotypically similar clusters, were seen at all levels of health care. It was not always possible to establish geographic connections within clusters. Interpretation & conclusion: High prevalence of both initial and acquired MDR was noted in M. tuberculosis isolates collected front pulmonary tuberculosis patients. Presence of small clusters of MDR isolates at all health care levels suggests transmission within the studied community.

pub-1668	A profile of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis in children	Objective: To describe the clinical profile of children with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis. Study Design: A multicentric study was conducted in three hospitals in Chennai city between July 1995 and December 1997. Children aged 6 months to 12 years with signs and symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis were investigated further. Clinical examination, chest radiograph, tuberculin skin test with 1 TU PPD and, sputum or gastric lavage for mycobacterial smear and culture were done for all and, lymph node biopsy when necessary. Results: A total of 2652 children were registered and tuberculosis was bacteriologically confirmed in 201. Predominant symptoms were history of an insidious illness (49%), fever and cough (47%), loss of weight (41%) and a visible glandular swelling (49%). Respiratory signs were few and 62% were undernourished. Over half the patients with confirmed TB had normal chest X-ray. Abnormal X-ray findings included parenchymal opacities in 47% and hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy in 26%. The prevalence of isoniazid resistance was 12.6% and MDR TB 4%. Conclusions: Children with tuberculosis present with fever and cough of insidious onset. Lymphadenopathy is a common feature even in children with pulmonary TB. A significant proportion of children have normal chest X-rays despite positive gastric aspirate cultures. Drug resistance rates in children mirror the pattern seen in adults in this geographic area.	bacteriologic diagnosis; clinical features; drug resistance; M. tuberculosis; pediatric TB	NORMAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; GASTRIC LAVAGE; BRONCHOALVEOLAR LAVAGE; TUBERCLE-BACILLI; CHILDHOOD; DIAGNOSIS; CULTURE; TOMOGRAPHY; VANCOMYCIN
10.1016_j.meegid.2008.06.006	Molecular snapshot of drug-resistant and drug-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains circulating in Bulgaria	We report results of the first study on the molecular basis of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains currently circulating in Bulgaria. The study panel consisted of 133 (including 37 drug-resistant) isolates recovered from newly diagnosed, adult pulmonary TB patients from different regions of Bulgaria in 2005-2006. Three types of the rpoB mutations were found in 20 of 27 RIF-resistant isolates; rpoB S531L was the most frequent. Eleven (48%) of 23 INH-resistant isolates had katG S315T mutation. inhA - 15C > T mutation was detected in one INH-resistant isolate (that also had katG315 mutation) and three INH-susceptible isolates. A mutation in embB306 was found in 7 of 11 EMB-resistant isolates. Comparison with spoligotyping and 24-VNTR locus typing data suggested that emergence and spread of drug-resistant and MDR-TB in Bulgaria are not associated with any specific spoligotype or MIRU-VNTR genotype.

pub-1670	A health systems assessment of the KwaZulu-Natal tuberculosis programme in the context of increasing drug resistance	SETTING: High mortality and high transmission rates of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) In KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa have highlighted the role of hospitals in the spread of TB and drug-resistant TB. OBJECTIVES: To determine the operational effectiveness of the National TB Programme (NTP) at a regional/district hospital and its referral clinics. DESIGN: In this multi-faceted retrospective case study, a framework was developed to evaluate the different components of the TB services, their performance in relation to each other and the system as a whole. Different methods used included structured and semi-structured Interviews, retrospective medical record reviews and retrospective register reviews. RESULTS: Only 18% of those diagnosed with smear-positive pulmonary TB (PTB) in the hospital laboratory completed their treatment and 11% were cured. Clinicians did not adhere to the diagnostic guidelines of the NTP. In the TB register, 85% of PTB cases were diagnosed in the absence of sputum microscopy. Chest X-rays alone were used to diagnose PTB in 45% of the records reviewed. In addition, clinicians failed to document a clinical history suggestive of TB. Only 66 (29%) of the hospital's 225 smear-positive PTB patients reached the clinics for completion of their treatment. CONCLUSION: System failures, together with inadequate knowledge and understanding of clinicians, undermined the effectiveness of the NTP. A reduction in TB and drug-resistant forms of TB is dependent on effective diagnosis, treatment and improved communication systems between the hospital, laboratory and its down-referral clinics.	systematic assessment; operational research; TB programme; MDR-TB; South Africa	SOUTH-AFRICA; GENERAL-PRACTITIONERS; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; INDIA; DELHI
pub-1671	Risk factors for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Hong Kong	SETTING: Previous anti-tuberculosis treatment is widely reported risk factor for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), whereas other risk factors are less well described. In Hong Kong, the clinical characteristics of MDR-TB have not been systematically evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors for MDR-TB in Hong Kong. DESIGN: MDR-TB patients treated between 1999 and 2003 were compared with non-MDR-TB patients by stratification of previous anti-tuberculosis treatment. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-six MDR-TB patients, including 93 with and 63 without a previous history of anti-tuberculosis treatment, were identified. Among the 322 non-MDR-TB controls, respectively 192 and 130 patients did and did not have a previous history of anti-tuberculosis treatment. Using logistic regression analysis, non-permanent residents (OR 6.85, 95 %CI 1.38-34.09), frequent travel (OR 2.48, 95%CI 1.07-5.74) and younger age were found to be independent predictors of MDR-TB in previously treated patients, whereas living on financial assistance lust failed to reach statistical significance (OR 2.75, 95%CI 0.98-7.68, P = 0.05). In the treatment-naive group, despite significant differences in baseline characteristics among MDR-TB and non-MDR-TB patients, no independent predictor variables could be identified. CONCLUSION: In Hong Kong, non-permanent residents, frequent travel and young age were independent predictors of MDR-TB among previously treated patients.

pub-1672	Decreased phosphorylation of STAT-1, STAT-4 and cytokine release in MDR-TB patients with primary resistance	SETTING: We recently showed that treatment failure rate was higher among multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients without a previous history of tuberculosis (TB) treatment, or so-called 'primary resistance'. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the phosphorylation levels of signal transducers and activators of transcription-1 (STAT-1) and STAT-4 and the subsequent cytokine release as a possible cause of a poor prognosis in MDR-TB patients with primary resistance. DESIGN: Ten patients with successfully treated pulmonary TB without resistance, 12 MDR-TB patients with acquired resistance and 10 MDR-TB patients with primary resistance were enrolled. After 24 h stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-12 (IL-12), purified protein derivative (PPD), or lysate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, flow cytometric analysis of intracellular pSTAT-1 and pSTAT-4 were performed and secretion of IFN-gamma, IL-12p40 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was measured in culture supernatant. RESULTS: The mean fluorescent intensities of pSTAT-1 and pSTAT-4 in PBMC of MDR-TB patients with primary resistance decreased on stimulation of IFN-gamma, PPD or lysate of M. tuberculosis when compared with patients with acquired resistance. In addition, secretion of IFN-gamma, IL-12p40 and TNF-alpha in these patients decreased on various stimuli. CONCLUSION: Decreased phosphorylation of STAT-1, STAT-4, and of subsequent cytokine release, might be associated with a poor prognosis in MDR-TB patients with primary resistance.

10.1111_j.1365_2672.2008.03815.x	Characterization of rpoB mutations associated with rifampin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis from eastern China	Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the features of rpoB gene mutations associated with Rifampin (RIF) resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) in eastern China. Methods and Results: The mutations of rpoB gene in 56 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis resisted to one to four first-line drugs (rifampin, isonicotinyl hydrazide, ethambutol and streptomycin) were analysed by polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (PCR-SSCP) and DNA sequencing. The results of PCR-SSCP showed 52 isolates were positive (existing rpoB mutation) including 47 isolates resisted to RIF. Subsequent results of DNA sequencing showed that 54 isolates had rpoB gene mutation including 49 isolates resisted to RIF. The most frequently mutated sites were at codons 526 (73.2%), 513 (10.7%) and 531 (3.5%). Conclusions: The rpoB codon 526 was the most frequently mutated site of RIF-resistant M. tuberculosis strains in eastern China and its frequency is significantly higher (P < 0.0001) compared with that in other areas of China and in other geographic regions worldwide. Significance and Impace of the Study: Our results reveal that geographic variation is responsible for rpoB mutations in M. tuberculosis and the resulting information will be helpful to improve a novel rapid molecular drug resistance screening approach for MDR TB.	mutation and resistance mechanisms; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Rifampin; rpoB	STRAND CONFORMATION POLYMORPHISM; POLYMERASE-CHAIN-REACTION; LINE PROBE ASSAY; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; GENE-MUTATIONS; GENOTYPIC ANALYSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; RAPID DETECTION; STRAINS; PCR
10.1111_j.1472_765X.2008.02403.x	Molecular identification and characterization of rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates by line probe assay: an approach for rapid diagnosis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Aim: Early identification and characterization of rifampicin-resistant (R(r)) Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates recovered from the samples of tuberculosis (TB) patients in the Aegean (West Anatolian) Region was intended. Methods and Results: Sixty isolates [47 (78.3%) multidrug-resistant (MDR)], which were identified as M. tuberculosis complex and phenotypically resistant to rifampicin by both BACTEC mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) 960 and 460 systems were analysed by a commercial line probe assay (INNO-LiPA Rif TB). The concordance of LiPA with the in vitro susceptibility test was found as 98.3%. Among the isolates, S531L (R5 pattern; 46.7%) and L511P/R, S512T, Q513L/K (Delta S1 pattern; 11.7%) were the most frequent mutation patterns. As compared with the BACTEC systems and conventional techniques for cultivation, identification and in vitro susceptibility testing, INNO-LiPA Rif TB after cultivation in BACTEC MGIT 960 system provided an average of 20 days early diagnosis of R(r)M. tuberculosis isolates. Conclusions: Rapid molecular identification and characterization of R(r)M. tuberculosis isolates after BACTEC MGIT 960 cultivation would be useful for faster diagnosis, infection control and planning of accurate treatment in MDR-TB patients. Significance and Impact of the Study: Patients with MDR-TB need a specified treatment and efficient follow-up strategies. Rapid and practical methodologies to diagnose and follow these patients should be applied in routine use.	identification; molecular genetic; mycobacteria; rapid techniques; resistance	RPOB MUTATIONS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; STRAINS; METAANALYSIS; COUNTRIES; TURKEY; LIPA
10.2174_157340608785700225	Synthesis, antimycobacterial activities and phototoxic evaluation of 5H-thiazolo[3,2-a]quinoline-4-carboxylic acid derivatives	Thirty four novel 7-fluoro/nitro-1,2-dihydro-5-oxo-8-(sub)-5H-thiazolo[3,2-a]quinoline-4-carboxylic acids were synthesized from 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid and 2,4-dichloro-5-fluoroacetophenone by multi step reaction, evaluated for in vitro and in vivo antimycobacterial activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (MTB), multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and Mycobacterium smegmatis (MC2) and also tested for the ability to inhibit the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase from M. smegmatis. Among the synthesized compounds, 8-[6-[[(1,1-dimethylethoxy) carbonyl]amino]-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hex-3-yl]-1,2-dihydro-7-nitro-5-oxo-5H-thiazolo[3,2-a]quinoline-4-carboxylic acid (10q) was found to be the most active compound in vitro with MIC of 0.08 mu M and < 0.08 mu M against MTB and MDR-TB respectively. Compound 10q was found to be 4.5 and >570 times more potent than isoniazid against MTB and MDR-TB respectively. In the in vivo animal model 10q decreased the bacterial load in lung and spleen tissues with 2.51 and 3.71-log10 protections respectively at the dose of 50 mg/kg body weight.	antimycobacterial activity; antitubercular activity; tuberculosis; thiazoloquinolone	DNA GYRASE; TUBERCULOSIS; GATIFLOXACIN
10.1089_mdr.2008.0823	Prevalence of Multidrug-Resistant Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Counties with Different Duration of DOTS Implementation in Rural China	Aims: This study aimed to describe the prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) among pulmonary TB patients in rural China and to determine the extent of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) circulating in areas with varied duration of Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course (DOTS) implementation. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two rural counties in eastern China: Deqing with over 10 years DOTS implementation and Guanyun under its second year of DOTS. The subjects were all culture-positive pulmonary TB patients newly diagnosed or re-treated during 12 months of 2004-2005. The proportion method was used for drug susceptibility testing. Results: Among the 399 subjects, 283 were new TB cases and 116 were previously treated. The rates of overall resistance (i.e., resistance to at least one drug) in new cases were 50.4% (67) and 63.4% (95), respectively, in Deqing and Guanyun (p = 0.028), and 67.3% (33) and 83.6% (56), respectively, in previously treated cases (p = 0.0410). The rates of MDR-TB in new cases were 3.8% (5) in Deqing and 14.7% (22) in Guanyun (p = 0.0018), and 16.3% (8) and 34.3% (23) in previously treated cases (p = 0.0305). Conclusions: Newly diagnosed and previously treated TB patients from the short-term DOTS-covered county were at higher risk for Overall drug-resistance TB and MDR-TB. Standardized diagnosis and treatment strategies for drug-resistant TB are urgently needed for effective control of MDR-TB in rural China.		ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUG-RESISTANCE; BARRIERS
10.1371_journal.pmed.0050188	The Infectiousness of Tuberculosis Patients Coinfected with HIV	Background The current understanding of airborne tuberculosis (TB) transmission is based on classic 1950s studies in which guinea pigs were exposed to air from a tuberculosis ward. Recently we recreated this model in Lime, Peru, and in this paper we report the use of molecular fingerprinting to investigate patient infectiousness in the current era of HIV infection and multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. Methods and Findings All air from a mechanically ventilated negative-pressure HIV-TB ward was exhausted over guinea pigs housed in an airborne transmission study facility on the roof. Animals had monthly tuberculin skin tests, and positive reactors were removed for autopsy and organ culture for M. tuberculosis. Temporal exposure patterns, drug susceptibility testing, and DNA fingerprinting of patient and animal TB strains defined infectious TB patients. Relative patient infectiousness was calculated using the Wells-Riley model of airborne infection. Over 505 study days there were 118 ward admissions of 97 HIV-positive pulmonary TB patients. Of 292 exposed guinea pigs, 144 had evidence of TB disease; a further 30 were tuberculin skin test positive only. There was marked variability in patient infectiousness; only 85% of 118 ward admissions by TB patients were shown by DNA fingerprinting to have caused 98% of the 125 characterised cases of secondary animal TB. 90% of TB transmission occurred from inadequately treated MDR TB patients. Three highly infectious MDR TB patients produced 226, 52, and 40 airborne infectious units (quanta) per hour. Conclusions A small number of inadequately treated MDR TB patients coinfected with HIV were responsible for almost all TB transmission, and some patients were highly infectious. This result highlights the importance of rapid TB durg-susceptibility testing to allow prompt initiation of effective treatment, and environmental control measures to reduce ongoing TB transmission in crowded health care settings. TB infection control must be prioritized in order to prevent health care facilities from disseminating the drug-resistant TB that they are attempting to treat.

10.1111_j.1365_3156.2008.02127.x	Drug-resistant TB and HIV in resource-limited settings: what TB/HIV programmes can learn from each other	Although management of drug resistance in tuberculosis (TB) and HIV in poor settings is in its infancy, lessons learned from TB may be relevant to HIV and vice versa. The experience with HIV has shown that rapid scale-up and lower drug pricing are achievable goals. The current prerequisites for obtaining drugs to treat multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) may be too stringent given the immediacy of the MDR-TB problem. We call for a more rapid roll-out of treatment for MDR-TB with fewer administrative encumbrances and a greater sense of urgency in national TB control programmes. On the other hand, antiretroviral roll-out programmes should learn from the genesis of the MDR-TB problem; laboratory monitoring should be enhanced and compliance optimized to avoid the acquisition of additional drug resistance in HIV.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; extensive-resistant tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant HIV infection; resource-limited settings	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; ANTIRETROVIRAL TREATMENT; INFECTED PATIENTS; TUBERCULOSIS; HEALTH; IMPACT
10.1016_j.tube.2008.06.002	Cellular responses to MPT-51, GlcB and ESAT-6 among MDR-TB and active tuberculosis patients in Brazil	Multi-drug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (MDR-TB) may result from either insufficiency of the host cellular immune response or mycobacterial. mechanisms of resistance. Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T lymphocytes from MDR-TB patients are poorly studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate CD4(+)-IFN-gamma(+), CD4(+)-IL-10(+), CD8(+)IFN-gamma(+) and CD8(+)IL-10(+) cell populations by flow cytometry in non-resistant TB and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients from mid-central Brazil after stimulation with MPT-51, GlcB and ESAT-6 recombinant antigens from M. tuberculosis in comparison to tuberculin skin test negative (TST) healthy individuals. Non-resistant TB patients present specific cellular responses (CD4 and CD8, both IFN-gamma and IL-10) to GLcB, MPT-51 and ESAT-6; while MDR-TB patients present only CD8(+)IFN-gamma(+) responses to ESAT-6 and CD8(+)IL-10(+) responses to GlcB and ESAT-6. The results show that MDR-TB patients present impaired specific CD4 IFN-gamma and IL-10 responses and increased/normal specific CD8 IFN-gamma and IL-10 responses. This suggests an important role for CD8 function in these patients. (c) 2008 El.sevier Ltd.

10.1016_j.vaccine.2008.06.066	The treatment of mice infected with multi-drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis using DNA vaccines or in combination with rifampin	The problems of tuberculosis (TB) and its drug resistance are very severe in China. New therapeutic agents or regimens to treat multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are urgently needed. In this study, the effects of Ag85A DNA or ESAT6/Ag85A chimeric DNA vaccines alone or in combination with rifampin (RFP) were studied for the treatment of mice with MDR-TB. Eighty female BALB/c mice infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolate HB361, which was resistant to high level of RFP, and low level of isoniazid (INH), were treated with the saline, plasmid vector pVAX1, RFP, HSP65 DNA, Ag85A DNA, Ag85A DNA combined with RFP, chimeric ESAT6/Ag85A DNA, chimeric ESAT6/Ag85A DNA combined with RFP, respectively. Different effects of DNA vaccines for the treatment of MDR-TB were demonstrated in this study. Compared with saline group, Ag85A DNA vaccine alone or Ag85A DNA in combination with rifampin group reduced the pulmonary and splenic bacterial loads by 0.58, 0.82 and 0.51, 0.69 logs, respectively. The pathological changes of lungs were also slight and the lesions were limited in comparison with that of the control mice in which the lesions were extensive and more necrotic changes were observed. Interestingly, the chimeric Ag85A/ESAT6 DNA vaccine showed the lower effect for the treatment of MDR-TB. Ag85A DNA vaccine played a main role for the treatment of TB and MDR-TB. We believe that this is the first report of the use of DNA vaccine in the treatment of MDR-TB, and that these data suggest that DNA vaccine was effective for the treatment of MDR-TB which might have the potential contribution for resolving this problem in developing countries.

10.1086_590009	Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in California, 1993-2006	Background. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) is a global public health emergency. We investigated the characteristics and extent of XDR TB in California to inform public health interventions. Methods. XDR TB was defined as TB with resistance to at least isoniazid, rifampin, a fluoroquinolone, and 1 of 3 injectable second-line drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). Pre-XDR TB was defined as TB with resistance to isoniazid and rifampin and either a fluoroquinolone or second-line injectable agent but not both. We analyzed TB case reports submitted to the state TB registry for the period 1993-2006. Local health departments and the state TB laboratory were queried to ensure complete drug susceptibility reporting. Results. Among 424 multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB cases with complete drug susceptibility reporting, 18 (4.2%) were extensively drug resistant, and 77 (18%) were pre-extensively drug resistant. The proportion of pre-XDR TB cases increased over time, from 7% in 1993 to 32% in 2005(P = .02). Among XDR TB cases, 83% of cases Pp. 02 involved foreign-born patients, and 43% were diagnosed in patients within 6 months after arrival in the United States. Mexico was the most common country of origin. Five cases (29%) of XDR TB were acquired during therapy in California. All patients with XDR TB had pulmonary disease, and most had prolonged infectious periods; the median time for conversion of sputum culture results was 195 days. Among 17 patients with known outcomes, 7 (41.2%) completed therapy, 5 (29.4%) moved, and 5 (29.4%) died. One patient continues to receive treatment. Conclusions. XDR TB and pre-XDR TB cases comprise a substantial fraction of MDR TB cases in California, indicating the need for interventions that improve surveillance, directly observed therapy, and rapid drug susceptibility testing and reporting.

10.1086_590005	Treatment outcomes for HIV-uninfected patients with multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis	Background. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) is more difficult to treat than is drug-susceptible TB. To elucidate the optimal therapy for MDR TB, we assessed the treatment outcomes and prognostic factors for patients with MDR TB. Methods. This study included patients who received an individualized treatment regimen for MDR TB at Samsung Medical Center, a tertiary referral hospital in Seoul, Korea, from January 1995 through December 2004. To identify the prognostic factors related to favorable treatment outcomes, univariate comparison and multiple logistic regression were performed. Results. Of 155 patients, 18 (12%) had newly diagnosed MDR TB, 81 (52%) had previously received treatment with first-line drugs, and 56 (36%) had received treatment with second-line drugs. The isolated strains were resistant to a median of 5 drugs. Twenty-seven patients (17%) had extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB at the start of treatment. Outcome assessment revealed that 102 patients (66%) were cured or completed therapy. The treatment success rates did not differ significantly between patients with non-XDR MDR TB and those with XDR TB (66% vs. 67%). Surgical resection was performed more frequently for patients with XDR TB than for those with non-XDR MDR TB (48% vs. 17%). Combined surgical resection, body mass index >= 8.5 (calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters), use of 14 effective drugs, and a negative sputum smear result were independent predictors of a favorable outcome. Conclusions. Early aggressive treatment comprising at least 4 effective drugs and surgical resection, when indicated, may improve the outcome for patients with MDR TB or XDR TB.

10.1073_pnas.0800965105	Impact of enhanced tuberculosis diagnosis in South Africa: A mathematical model of expanded culture and drug susceptibility testing	South Africa has high rates of tuberculosis (TB), including multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains. Expanding access to culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) for TB diagnosis may help control this epidemic, but the potential impact of existing and novel TB diagnostics is uncertain. By fitting to World Health Organization epidemiological estimates, we developed a compartmental difference-equation model of the TB/HIV epidemic among South African adults. Performing culture and DST in 37% of new cases and 85% of previously treated cases was projected to save 47,955 lives (17.2% reduction in TB mortality, 95% simulation interval (S.I.) 8.9-24.4%), avert 7,721 MDR-TB cases (14.1% reduction, 95% S.I. 5.3-23.8%), and prevent 46.6% of MDR-TB deaths (95% S.I. 32.6-56.0%) in South Africa over 10 years. Used alone, expanded culture and DST did not reduce XDR-TB incidence, but they enhanced the impact of transmission-reduction strategies, such as respiratory isolation. In South Africa, expanding TB culture and DST could substantially reduce TB, and particularly MDR-TB, mortality. Control of XDR-TB will require additional interventions, the impact of which may be enhanced by improved TB diagnosis.	clinical laboratory techniques; drug resistance; theoretical models	NEGATIVE PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; HIV; INFECTION; SETTINGS; SPUTUM
10.1056_NEJMoa0800106	Comprehensive treatment of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis	Background: Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis has been reported in 45 countries, including countries with limited resources and a high burden of tuberculosis. We describe the management of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis and treatment outcomes among patients who were referred for individualized outpatient therapy in Peru. Methods: A total of 810 patients were referred for free individualized therapy, including drug treatment, resective surgery, adverse-event management, and nutritional and psychosocial support. We tested isolates from 651 patients for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis and developed regimens that included five or more drugs to which the infecting isolate was not resistant. Results: Of the 651 patients tested, 48 (7.4%) had extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis; the remaining 603 patients had multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. The patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis had undergone more treatment than the other patients (mean [+/-SD] number of regimens, 4.2+/-1.9 vs. 3.2+/-1.6; P<0.001) and had isolates that were resistant to more drugs (number of drugs, 8.4+/-1.1 vs. 5.3+/-1.5; P<0.001). None of the patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis were coinfected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis received daily, supervised therapy with an average of 5.3+/-1.3 drugs, including cycloserine, an injectable drug, and a fluoroquinolone. Twenty-nine of these patients (60.4%) completed treatment or were cured, as compared with 400 patients (66.3%) with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (P=0.36). Conclusions: Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis can be cured in HIV-negative patients through outpatient treatment, even in those who have received multiple prior courses of therapy for tuberculosis.

10.1186_1471_2334_8_109	The recent-transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains among Iranian and Afghan relapse cases: a DNA-fingerprinting using RFLP and spoligotyping	Background: Relapse of tuberculosis (TB) may develop as the result of reactivation of the endogenous primary infection, or as a result of a exogenous reinfection. This survey evaluated the rate of reactivation versus recent transmission among Iranian and Afghan relapse cases. Methods: The sputum specimens were digested, examined microscopically for acid-fast bacilli, and inoculated into Lowenstein-Jensen slants by standard procedures. Thereafter, the susceptibility and identification tests were performed on culture positive specimens. Subsequently, the strains that were identified as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (258 isolates) were subjected to IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and spoligotyping. Additional patient's information was collected for further epidemiological analysis. Patients whose isolates had identical genotyping patterns were considered a cluster with recent transmission episode. Results: Out of 258 available isolates, 72(28%) had multi-drug resistant (MDR-TB) in ratio and 42 (16.2%) had other resistant. Notably, 38 of MDR-TB cases (52%) were isolated from Afghan patients. By IS6110-RFLP typing method, 65 patients (25%) were clustered in 29 clusters. In cluster cases, the intra-community transmissions between Iranian and Afghan patients were 41%. All MDR-TB patients in clusters had either Haarlem I or Beijing characteristic. The risk factors like sex, family history, close contact, living condition, PPD test result and site of TB infection were not associated with clustering. Although, the MDR-TB strains were more frequent in non-cluster cases (31%) than cluster one(18%) (P < 0.05). Majority of M. tuberculosis strains isolated from non-cluster cases were belong to EA13 (51; 30%) and CASI(32; 18.6%) superfamilies. Conclusion: During the studied period, reactivation of a previous infection remain the more probable cause of recurrence. Although, the evidence of intra-community transmission between Iranian and Afghan TB cases, highlighted the impact of afghan immigrants in national tuberculosis control program (NTP) of Iran.

10.1164_rccm.200802_240OC	Influence of multidrug resistance on tuberculosis treatment outcomes with standardized regimens	Rationale: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) poses a major challenge to global TB control. We analyzed the association between estimated prevalence of initial or acquired MDR-TB, and treatment outcomes reported nationally. Objectives: We analyzed the estimated prevalence of initial or acquired MDR-TB and treatment outcomes reported nationally. Methods: Countries were analyzed if multidrug resistance prevalence estimates were available, and if they reported outcomes for more than 250 cases treated using standardized regimens in 2003 and/or 2004. Data sources were the World Health Organization for treatment regimens, prevalence of initial multidrug resistance, and reported cases and treatment outcomes in 2003 and 2004; the joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS for HIV seroprevalence; and the World Bank for income per capita. The adjusted impact of initial multidrug resistance on initial and retreatment outcomes was estimated with weighted multivariate linear regression. Measurements and Main Results: Among countries using one of two standardized initial regimens, failure rates averaged 5.0%, and relapse rates averaged 12.8% in the 20 countries where prevalence of initial multidrug resistance exceeded 3%, compared with an average of 1.6% (P < 0.0001) and 8.1% (P = 0.0002), respectively, in 83 countries where initial multidrug resistance prevalence was less than 3%. In 92 countries using one standardized retreatment regimen, failure rates were 2.7%,3.8%, 6.2%, and 8.1% in quartiles of increasing prevalence of acquired multidrug resistance (P < 0.0001). When stratified by initial multidrug resistance prevalence, initial and retreatment outcomes in the 79 countries using the 6-month rifampin initial regimen were not significantly different from the 24 countries using the 2-month rifampin initial regimen. Conclusions: Currently recommended standardized TB initial and retreatment regimens should be reevaluated in countries where prevalence of initial multidrug resistance exceeds 3%, in view of poor treatment outcomes.	tuberculosis; tuberculosis treatment; drug resistance; multidrug resistance; treatment outcomes	SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; RETREATMENT REGIMEN; DRUG-RESISTANCE; MDR-TB; FAILURE; TRIAL; STRATEGIES; RECURRENCE; CATEGORY
10.2217_17460913.3.4.405	Importance of improved TB diagnostics in addressing the extensively drug-resistant TB crisis	There is an urgent need for new, rapid diagnostics to stem the tide of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. Current identification and detection of resistance for the majority of Mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, require weeks and multiple methodologies to complete. The sheer number and variety of tests required often exceeds the capacity of many laboratories. Current strategies center on improvement of existing tests and development of novel ones. Ultimately, what is needed is a single, rapid, diagnostic for identification and determination of drug resistance in M. tuberculosis. Such a method should be capable of detecting antibiotic resistance for all first- and second-line agents irrespective of the genetic mechanism of resistance. Detection should be achievable directly from clinical specimens. Yet, improved diagnostics are only part of a larger solution. Such a solution must include a comprehensive approach in which careful consideration is given to each particular setting relative to local resources and overall burden of disease. Such an approach is essential for the future of TB control and stemming the tide of MDR-TB and XDR-TB.	diagnostics; drug resistance; MDR-TB; susceptibility testing; tuberculosis; XDR-TB	ACID-FAST BACILLI; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; SMEAR MICROSCOPY; FLUOROQUINOLONE RESISTANCE; CLINICAL SPECIMENS; UNITED-STATES; SPUTUM; SUSCEPTIBILITY
10.1002_prot.21953	Structural studies of shikimate 5-dehydrogenase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of mortality due to a single bacterial pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The reemergence of TB as a potential public health threat, the high susceptibility of human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons to the disease, the proliferation of multi-drug-resistant strains (MDR-TB) and, more recently, of extensively drug resistant isolates (XDR-TB) have created a need for the development of new antimycobacterial agents. Amongst the several proteins and/or enzymes to be studied as potential targets to develop novel drugs against M. tuberculosis, the enzymes of the shikimate pathway are attractive targets because they are essential in algae, higher plants, bacteria, and fungi, but absent from mammals. The mycobacterial shikimate pathway leads to the biosynthesis of chorismate, which is a precursor of aromatic amino acids, naphthoquinones, menaquinones, and mycobactins. Here we report the structural studies by homology modeling and circular dichroism spectroscopy of the shikimate dehydrogenase from M. tuberculosis (MtSDH), which catalyses the fourth step of the shikimate pathway. Our structural models show that the MtSDH has similar structure to other shikimate dehydrogenase structures previously reported either in presence or absence of NADP, despite the low amino acid sequence identity. The circular dichroism spectra corroborate the secondary structure content observed in the MtSDH models developed. The enzyme was stable up to 50 degrees C presenting a cooperative unfolding profile with the midpoint of the unfolding temperature value of similar to 63-64 degrees C, as observed in the unfolding experiment followed by circular dichroism. Our MtSDH structural models and circular dichroism data showed small conformational changes induced by NADP binding. We hope that the data presented here will assist the rational design of antitubercular agents.	circular dichroism; modeling; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; shikimate pathway	MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; PROTEIN SECONDARY STRUCTURE; 3-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE; DEHYDROGENASE AROE; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; PATHWAY; PURIFICATION; EXPRESSION; PREDICTION; PROFILES
10.2471_BLT.07.049767	Financial resources required for tuberculosis control to achieve global targets set for 2015	Objective To estimate the financial resources required-to achieve the 2015 targets for global tuberculosis (TB) control, which have been set within the framework of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Methods The Global Plan to Stop TB, 2006-2015 was developed by the Stop TB Partnership. It sets out what needs to be done to achieve the 2015 targets for global TB control, based on WHO's Stop TB Strategy. Plan costs were estimated using spreadsheet models that included epidemiological, demographic, planning and unit cost data. Findings A total of US$ 56 billion is required during the period 2006-2015 (93% for TB-endemic countries, 7% for international technical agencies), increasing from US$ 3.5 billion in 2006 to US$ 6.7 billion in 2015. The single biggest cost (US$ 3 billion per year) is for the treatment of drug-susceptible cases in DOTS programmes. Other major costs are treatment of patients with multi- and extensively drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB and XDR-TB), collaborative TB/HIV activities, and advocacy, communication and social mobilization. Low-income countries account for 41% of total funding needs and 65% of funding needs for TB/HIV. Middle-income countries account for 72% of the funding needed for treatment of MDR-TB and XDR-TB. African countries require the largest increases in funding. Conclusion Achieving the 2015 global targets set for TB control requires a major increase in funding. To support resource mobilization, comprehensive and costed national plans that are in line with the Global Plan to Stop TB are needed, backed up by robust assessments of the funding that can be raised in each country from domestic sources and the balance that is needed from donors.

pub-1691	Outcome of treatment of MDR-TB patients with standardised regimens, Iran, 2002-2006	BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) imposes a formidable burden on national health systems. There is still no consensus on the subject, with controversies regarding treatment protocols, treatment outcomes and the various treatment regimens. METHODS: The present study describes Iran's second national cohort for treatment of MDR-TB. The study comprised all documented MDR-TB cases in Iran referred to our centre during the period 2002-2006. All patients received a standardised second-line regimen consisting of ofloxacin, cycloserine, prothionamide and amikacin. Based on drug susceptibility testing results, ethambutol and pyrazinamide were added to the regimen. RESULTS: Forty-three patients diagnosed with MDR-TB, with a mean age of 44.38 +/- 19.05 years, received treat-ment; of these, 27 (62.8%) were male. Twenty-three were (53.5%) Iranians and the remainder were Afghans. All patients were acquired MDR-TB cases. Of the 43 cases, 25 (58.1%) experienced severe clinically significant adverse effects; 29 (67.5%) had a successful outcome and 14 (32.5%) had a poor outcome (treatment failure in six [14%] and death in eight [18.6%]). Mortality was higher in Iranians (P = 0.039) and in patients whose initial regimen was changed due to adverse drug reactions (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Compared with previous studies, our study was able to obtain more favourable outcomes of MDR-TB treatment using a standardised regimen.

pub-1692	Drug-resistant tuberculosis and HIV in Ukraine: a threatening convergence of two epidemics?	OBJECTIVE: To investigate anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug resistance rates in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, and to explore the association between the epidemics of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). METHODS: All consecutive newly diagnosed and previously treated patients with sputum smear-positive TB presenting to all TB units in Donetsk Oblast over 12 months were invited to take part in the study. A total of 1293 and 203 patients with TB were tested for HIV and MDR-TB in the civilian and penitentiary sectors, respectively. RESULTS: Of those enrolled for the study, 307 were HIV-positive, 379 had MDR-TB, and 97 had MDR-TB and HIV co-infection. MDR-TB rates in the civilian see-tor were respectively 15.5% (95%CI 13.1-17.8) and 41.5% (95%CI 36.4-46.5) in newly diagnosed and previously treated TB patients. Among prisoners, MDR-TB rates were 21.8% (95%CI 12.4-31.2) in new cases and 52.8% (95%CI 43.9-61.7) in previously treated TB cases. HIV status was significantly associated with MDR-TB (OR 1.7,95%CI 1.3-2.3). CONCLUSIONS: High MDR-TB rates and a positive association between MDR-TB and HIV epidemics were found in Donetsk Oblast. Urgent measures to improve HIV prevention, control of drug-resistant TB and collaboration between HIV and TB control activities need to be implemented without further delay.

10.1086_588292	Risk factors and mortality associated with default from multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment	Background. Completing treatment for multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) may be more challenging than completing first-line TB therapy, especially in resource-poor settings. The objectives of this study were to (1) identify risk factors for default from MDR TB therapy (defined as prolonged treatment interruption), (2) quantify mortality among patients who default from treatment, and (3) identify risk factors for death after default from treatment. Methods. We performed a retrospective chart review to identify risk factors for default from MDR TB therapy and conducted home visits to assess mortality among patients who defaulted from such therapy. Results. Sixty-seven (10.0%) of 671 patients defaulted from MDR TB therapy. The median time to treatment default was 438 days (interquartile range, 152-710 days), and 27 (40.3%) of the 67 patients who defaulted from treatment had culture-positive sputum at the time of default. Substance use (hazard ratio, 2.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.56-5.62;), substandard housing conditions (hazard ratio, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-3.11; P=.03), later year of enrollment (hazard ratio, 1.62, 95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.41; P=.02), and health district (P=.02) predicted default from therapy in a multivariable analysis. Severe adverse events did not predict default from therapy. Forty-seven (70.1%) of 67 patients who defaulted from therapy were successfully traced; of these, 25 (53.2%) had died. Poor bacteriologic response, <s1 year of treatment at the time of default, low education level, and diagnosis with a psychiatric disorder significantly predicted death after default in a multivariable analysis. Conclusions. The proportion of patients who defaulted from MDR TB treatment was relatively low. The large proportion of patients who had culture-positive sputum at the time of treatment default underscores the public health importance of minimizing treatment default. Prognosis for patients who defaulted from therapy was poor. Interventions aimed at preventing treatment default may reduce TB-related mortality.

pub-1694	A new protocol for multiple inhalation of IFN-gamma successfully treats MDR-TB: a case study	Aerosolized interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) leads to transient conversion of sputum smears in multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (MDR-TB). OBJECTIVE: To test long-term conversion of sputum smears using the new Jena protocol. DESIGN: Four MDR-TB patients were treated with acrosolized recombinant IFN-gamma (rIFN-gamma) twice weekly for 8 weeks and anti-tuberculosis drugs. Patients were monitored clinically and T-cell subpopulations were analyzed. RESULTS: The treatment was well tolerated. All sputum smears cleared within 6-8 weeks, and radiological signs of recovery lasted in all patients for 73-106 months (the entire follow-up period). Before treatment, a patient with a 20+ year history of TB showed no 78 T-cells; these cells appeared during treatment. The proportion of natural killer (NK) cells was enhanced during treatment and remained elevated. The proportion of CD4(+)/CD25(+) T-cells in the blood rose after treatment and remained elevated at 2 and 10 months afterwards. No significant change in T-cell levels appeared in patients with a shorter history of TB, except for a tendency toward a slight increase in gamma delta T-cells during treatment. CONCLUSION: We invite further confirmation, but aerosolized rIFN-gamma plus anti-microbial treatment cured MDR-TB in this case study. The optimal dosing schedule needs to be determined.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; inhaled IFN-gamma; gamma delta T-cells	RESISTANT PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; AEROSOLIZED INTERFERON-GAMMA; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MOUSE MACROPHAGES; IMMUNE-RESPONSE; CELLS; INFECTION; DISEASE; RECEPTOR; THERAPY
10.1089_mdr.2008.0798	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Lisbon, Portugal: A molecular epidemiological perspective	Portugal has the fourth highest tuberculosis (TB) incidence rate in the European Union (EU). Thirty-nine percent of all cases originate in Lisbon Health Region. Portugal also presents high levels of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) (1.5%, primary rate and 2.4%, in retreatment cases). In the present study we have characterized 58 MDR-TB clinical isolates by: (i) determining the resistance profile to first- and second-line drugs used. in the treatment of tuberculosis; (ii) genotyping all isolates by MIRU-VNTR; (iii) analyzing mutations conferring resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, and ethambutol, in katG, mabA-inhA, rpoB, rpsL, rrs, and pncA genes. We have therefore established the prevalence of the most common mutations associated with drug resistance in the Lisbon Health Region: C-15T in mabA-inhA for isoniazid; S531L in rpoB for rifampicin; K43R in rpsL for streptomycin; and V125G in pncA for pyrazinamide. By genotyping all isolates and combining with the mutational results, we were able to assess the isolates' genetic relatedness and determine possible transmission events. Strains belonging to family Lisboa, characterized several years ago, are still responsible for the majority of the MDR-TB. Even more alarming is the high prevalence of extensive drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) among the MDR-TB isolates, which was found to be 53%. The TB status in Portugal therefore requires urgent attention to contain the strains continuously responsible for MDR-TB and now, XDR-TB.

pub-1696	Physician-initiated courtesy MODS testing for TB and MDR-TB diagnosis and patient management	SETTING: Laboratorio de Investigacion de Enfermedades Infecciosas, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) and government health centres, Lima, Peru. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the contribution of unselected (courtesy) microscopic observation drug susceptibility (MODS) testing to the diagnosis and/or drug susceptibility testing (DST) of tuberculosis and their subsequent impact upon patient management. DESIGN: Retrospective database analysis and case note review of MODS culture-positive cases. RESULTS: Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated in 28.9% of 225 samples (209 patients); 22.2% of 63 positive cases were multidrug-resistant. In 58 MODS culture-positive cases with follow-up data available, MODS provided culture confirmation of diagnosis, DST or both in 82.8%, before any standard method. In, 41.4%, this result should have prompted a modification in patient management. Delays between laboratory result and initiation or change of treatment, where applicable, took on average 42 and 64 days, respectively, of which a delay of respectively 17 and 48 days occurred after the receipt of results by the health facility. CONCLUSION: MODS provides important data for clinical management within a meaningful timeframe and should contribute positively to patient outcomes due to earlier initiation of appropriate therapy. Although clinicians may successfully select patients likely to benefit from MODS, ongoing work is required to identify optimal implementation of the assay and to reduce logistical and health system derived delays.	tuberculosis; diagnosis; MODS; multi-drug resistance (MDR)	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-SUSCEPTIBILITY ASSAY; MICROSCOPIC-OBSERVATION; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; PERU; DELAYS; LIMA
pub-1697	High levels of resistance to second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs among prisoners with pulmonary tuberculosis in Georgia	SETTING: Penitentiary system of Georgia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of resistance to second-line drugs among prisoners with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). DESIGN: Retrospective evaluation of resistance to second-line drugs in tuberculosis (TB) patients treated from 2001 to 2003. RESULTS: The overall observed prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was 14.4% (39/270). The lowest resistance was found for ofloxacin (OFX), which was 2.2% (6/270) overall and 5.1% (2/39) among MDR patients. Isolates from four non-MDR patients who had never received anti-tuberculosis treatment were found to be resistant to OFX. Resistance to kanamycin and capreomycin occurred simultaneously only among MDR patients and was observed in 17/39 cases (43.6%). High rates of resistance to >= 2 second-line drugs (18/39, 46.2%) and >= 3 second-line drugs (10/39, 25.6%) were observed among all MDR-TB patients, reaching respectively 59.3% and 29.6% among previously treated MDR-TB cases. Only one patient was found to be resistant to four second-line drugs. No extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) according to the latest definition was detected. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal a serious threat to the TB control efforts in the study population.

10.1164_rccm.200709_1436OC	Rapid molecular screening for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in a high-volume public health laboratory in South Africa	Rationale The dual challenges to tuberculosis (TB) control of HIV infection and multidrug resistance are particularly pressing in South Africa. Conventional methods for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance take weeks to months to produce results. Rapid molecular testing for drug resistance is available but has not been implemented in high-TB-burden settings. Objectives: To assess the performance and feasibility of implementation of a commercially available molecular line-probe assay for rapid detection of rifampicin and isoniazid resistance. Methods: We performed the assay directly on 536 consecutive smear-positive sputum specimens from patients at increased risk of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB in a busy routine diagnostic laboratory in Cape Town, South Africa. Results were compared with conventional liquid culture and drug susceptibility testing on solid medium. Measurements and Main Results: Overall, 97% of smear-positive specimens gave interpretable results within 1-2 days using the molecular assay. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 98.9, 99.4, 97.9, and 99.7%, respectively, for detection of rifampicin resistance; 94.2,99.7,99.1, and 97.9%, respectively, for detection of isoniazid resistance; and 98.8, 100, 100, and 99.7%, respectively, for detection of multidrug resistance compared with conventional results. The assay also performed well on specimens that were contaminated on conventional culture and on smear-negative, culture-positive specimens. Conclusions: This molecular assay is a highly accurate screening tool for MDR TB, which achieves a substantial reduction in diagnostic delay. With overall performance characteristics that are superior to conventional culture and drug susceptibility testing and the possibility for high throughput with substantial cost savings, molecular testing has the potential to revolutionize MDR TB diagnosis.	tuberculosis; MDR TB; molecular diagnosis	GENOTYPE MTBDR ASSAY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; ISONIAZID RESISTANCE; RIFAMPIN; SPECIMENS; MUTATIONS; STRAINS; PROGRAM; KATG
10.2217_17460913.3.2.135	The TB laboratory of the future: macrophagebased selection of XDR-TB therapeutics	Therapy of multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB is highly problematic; that of extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB even more so. Both infections result in high mortality, especially if the patient is coinfected with HIV or presents with AIDS. Selection of therapy for these infections is limited and, for most situations, it is performed 'blind'. However, there is a solution for the selection of effective therapy and this is presented herein. Ideal therapy of the patient infected with MDR-TB or XDR-TB can be determined a priori by the mycobacteriology laboratory. This would involve the isolation of the patient's macrophages, the phagocytosis of the mycobacterial isolate and the presentation of the antitubercular agent to the macrophage-bacterium complex.

10.1128_JCM.02343_07	Fluorometric assay for testing rifampin susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex	"The emergence and transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) have raised concern about diagnostic delay associated with culture-based drug susceptibility testing methods. The association between rifampin resistance and MDR-TB or XDR-TB makes it an important genetic marker for genotypic drug susceptibility testing. In this article, we describe the analysis of the physical properties of the rifampin resistance-determining region (RRDR) in the rpoB gene by high-resolution thermal melt analysis as a method for detecting rifampin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. The RRDR from the M. tuberculosis complex was amplified by PCR from DNA templates extracted from sputum cultures of M. tuberculosis or the laboratory strain (H37Rv) in the presence of a fluorescent DNA binding dye. Subsequent mixing of the amplification products from the respective sputum cultures and the laboratory strain and thermocycling allowed the formation of DNA duplexes. The thermal denaturation properties of these DNA duplexes were determined by measuring the derivative of the intensity of fluorescence at different temperatures. Analysis of DNA extracted from 153 sputum cultures showed a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 100% for the detection of rifampin resistance compared to the ""gold standard"" culture-based phenotyping method. No statistical difference was detected in the performance of the method when applied to crude DNA from 134 boiled cultures. This method, named ""FAST-Rif"" (""fluorometric assay for susceptibility testing of rifampin""), allowed the rapid, reliable, and easy detection of genotypic rifampin resistance as a marker for MDR-TB and XDR-TB."

10.3343_kjlm.2008.28.2.95	Detection of rifampin resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex using denaturing HPLC	Background : Tuberculosis (TB) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. The surge of TB has been accompanied by an increase in multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). In this study, we developed a denaturing HPLC (DHPLC) method for detecting rpoB gene mutation as a rifampin resistance based on sequence. Methods : In this study, we used 99 mycobacterial isolates grown in Ogawa media. At first, we used a PCR method that can amplify the 235 bp and 136 bp rpoB DNAs of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB) and Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). And then, PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of rpoB DNA (342 bp), which comprises the Rjf(T) region, was used for the differential identification of Mycobacteria. Finally, we detected these amplicons by DHPLC, compared to PCR-RFLP results, and performed sequencing. Results: Among 99 mycobacterial isolates, 80 (81 %) were MTB and 19 (19%) were NTM. NTM were identified to 7 different species by DHPLC and PCR-RFLP. rpoB mutation was detected in 9 (11 %) of the MTB specimens. These results were confirmed by using sequencing. Conclusions : DHPLC provided a rapid, simple, and automatable performance for detection of rifampin resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and would be helpful as a supplemental method in high-throughput clinical laboratories.	tuberculosis; multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB); non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM); denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC)	PERFORMANCE LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; POLYMERASE GENE RPOB; RNA-POLYMERASE; HETERODUPLEX ANALYSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; MUTATIONS; IDENTIFICATION; INFECTION; BRCA1; DHPLC

Methodology: It is a retrospective descriptive study conducted in Khuzestan province in the south west of Iran, from 2002 to March 2006. Medical records of tuberculosis patients over the 5-year period were reviewed and death data were analyzed. Inclusion criteria were documented TB, diagnosed based on National Tuberculosis Program (NTP), extracted data were analyzed in SPSS11.5 system and by descriptive statistics. Results: One hundred and twenty five deaths (3.15%) with mean age of 48.96+/- 10.03 years were detected. The frequency rate for cigarette smoking, diabetes, chronic renal failure, MDR-TB, imprisonment, HIV infection and injection drug usage were 31.2%,16%, 6.4%,6.4%,22.4%,13.6% and 22.4%, respectively. Eighty four deaths (67.2%) were directly attributed to tuberculosis, among them overwhelming TB disease, haemoptysia, and MDR-TB accounted as the cause of death in 77.4%, 13.1%, 9.5% and 6.4% respectively. Forty one (32.8%) deaths were due to other medical problems, which included AIDS, cardiovascular diseases, bacterial super infection and cancers i.e. 21.9%, 19.5%, 17.1% and 12.2% respectively. Conclusions: This study showed that overwhelming TB disease, haemoptysis, cardiovascular diseases, bacterial super infection and cancers are the main cause of death. Smoking, imprisonment, injection drug usage and diabetes are frequent risk factors for TB mortality.	cause of death; tuberculosis mortality; risk factor	MORTALITY; RUSSIA
pub-1704	Surgical interventions in multi drug-resistant tuberculosis: Retrospective analysis of 27 patients treated at a Tertiary Level Care Center	Objective: To assess the results of surgery for Muttidrug- Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Methodology: Retrospective analysis was done in 27 cases of multidrug- resistant tuberculosis in whom some surgical interventions were carried out at Department of Thoracic surgery, Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar between the years 2002 to 2007. There were 18 mate and 9 female patients in the age group of 14-54 years. All were sputum positive at the time of surgery. Majority of patients were treated with pulmonary resections (pneumonectomy [n=07], bilobectomy [n=08] and lobectomy [n=10]), while primary thoracoplasty with apicolysis was done in two patients. Postoperatively 2(nd) line anti tubercular chemotherapy was prescribed for 24 months. Results: There was one early and one late death. Postoperative complications were seen in three cases. One patient developed bronchopleural fistula with empyema. At a mean follow-up of one year bacteriological cure was achieved in 24 patients. Conclusion: Judiciously performed adjuvant surgery can yield excellent long term bacteriological cure with acceptable mortality and morbidity in multidrug- resistant tuberculosis. Morbidity and drug compliance remain as problem areas.	muttidrug resistant-tuberculosis; pulmonary resection; thoracoplasty	
10.1007_s11095_007_9381_6	Preparation and in Vivo evaluation of a dry powder for inhalation of capreomycin	Purpose. To develop an aerosol system for efficient local lung delivery of a tuberculostatic drug. Methods. The antibiotic, capreomycin sulfate, was spray dried to form a dry powder aerosol. The chemical content and physical properties of resulting particles were assessed under various storage conditions. Plasma concentrations of capreomycin after insufflation into guinea pigs were evaluated at three doses, and compared to IV and IM administration of a capreomycin solution. Results. Dry powder aerosols containing capreomycin were formulated to enable efficient delivery of large drug masses to the lungs of guinea pigs. Aerosols loaded with 73% CS were shown to possess good aerosolization properties and physical-chemical stability for up to 3 months at room temperature. Upon insufflation into guinea pigs, the amount of CS reaching the bloodstream was significantly lower compared to IV or IM administration, but resulted in a significantly longer drug half-life. Conclusions. The results indicate that large doses of capreomycin in dry powder form can be efficiently delivered to the lungs of guinea pigs, which may result in high local drug exposure but significantly reduced systemic exposure as suggested by plasma concentrations in the present studies. These systems have considerable potential to provide more effective therapy for MDR-TB.	aerosols; antibiotics; insufflation; pulmonary drug delivery; tuberculosis	PNEUMOCYSTIS-CARINII PNEUMONIA; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; SPRAY-DRIED POWDERS; CYSTIC-FIBROSIS; FORMULATION COMPONENTS; PARTICLE-SIZE; PENTAMIDINE; TOBRAMYCIN; DISPERSION; AEROSOL
10.1258_td.2007.070131	Risk factors for drug resistant tuberculosis in southeast Turkey	We undertook a cross-sectional survey of 116 patients at Dicle Hospital,Turkey, who had with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis (TB). Demographic and clinical features, including age, gender, pulmonaryTB history, associated diabetes mellitus, previousTB treatment, residential area and education, were collected from charts. Eighty-four of the strains were found to be susceptible to all drugs. The resistance to one or more drug(s) was found in 32 strains. Multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB was found in 13 strains (11.3% of the total and 40.7% of the drug resistant strains). The resistance to isoniazid was the most frequently seen (25 strains, 21.5%). In the multivariable analysis, only previousTB treatment (P = 0.000) remained a significant predictor for drug resistance; in MDR, previousTB treatments (P = 0.002) remained significant in the final model. The patient's educational status was found to be negatively correlated with the risk of MRD-TB (P = 0.035). PreviousTB treatment and low educational status were found to important risk factors for the development of MDR-TB.

10.1155_2008_857901	Diagnosis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis: Current standards and challenges	INTRODUCTION: The emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and, more recently, extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is widely considered a serious threat to global TB control. Over 400,000 new cases of MDR-TB occur each year and, although their rates are currently unknown, XDR-TB cases have been detected in every country where there is capacity to detect them (including Canada). METHODS: The present article provides a narrative overview of the various diagnostic options available for XDR-TB, including conventional tools and newer rapid tests for drug resistance. Available data suggest that automated liquid cultures are highly accurate and their use is rapidly expanding. Newly developed phenotypic tests include TK Medium (Salubris Inc, USA), microscopic-observation drug-susceptibility assay, FASTPlaque-Response bacteriophage assay (Biotec Laboratories Ltd, UK), colorimetric redox indicator methods and the microcolony method. These tests are usually cheaper but not always simple to perform, with some requiring high standards of biosafety and quality control. Among the newly developed phenotypic methods, reverse hybridization-based assays, referred to as line probe assays, represent a useful toot because of their superior accuracy and cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: To effectively address the threats of MDR-TB and XDR-TB, global initiatives are required to scale-up culture and drug susceptibility testing capacities, especially in high-burden countries where such capacity is scarce. In parallel, efforts are needed to expand the use of novel and emerging technologies ie, molecular diagnostics) for the rapid determination of drug resistance.	diagnosis; drug resistance; MDR-TB; tuberculosis; XDR-TB	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; RAPID DETECTION; EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES; RIFAMPICIN RESISTANCE; ASSAY; METAANALYSIS; MULTICENTER; SPECIMENS; TOOLS; TB
10.1016_j.ijid.2007.05.003	Low levels of second-line drug resistance among multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Rwanda	Background: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has become a therapeutic problem in many parts of the world, necessitating the inclusion of second-tine anti-tuberculosis drugs in specific treatment regimens. Methods: We studied the susceptibility of 69 MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Rwanda to second-line drugs by the BACTEC 460 method. Results: The results showed that 62 (89.9%) were resistant to rifabutin while a tow rate (4.3%) of resistance was registered for ofloxacin; there was one case (1.4%) of resistance each for para-aminosalicylic acid, kanamycin, ethionamide, and ctarithromycin. Conclusions: This information is important for devising an appropriate treatment regimen for MDR-TB patients in order to stop the spread of MDR strains and contain the acquisition of additional drug resistance in Rwanda.

pub-1712	Prevalence of primary multidrug resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs in Pakistan	SETTING: Pakistan ranks sixth in the world in terms of tuberculosis (TB) burden, with a World Health Organization estimated incidence of 181 per 100 000, or 286 000 new cases annually. Hospital-based data indicate a significant problem of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in the country and highlight the need to assess its extent at community level. In this cross-sectional study, sputum samples from 742 untreated newly diagnosed pulmonary TB patients from all over the country were used. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of primary drug resistance in Pakistan. RESULTS: Of 672 culture-positive patients, 76 (11.3%) showed resistance to one or more drugs. Resistance to streptomycin (10 mu g/ml) was found in 36 (5.4%) patients, isoniazid (INH) (1 mu g/ml) in 51 (7.6%), rifampicin (RMP) (5 mu g/ml) in 15 (2.2%), ethambutol (10 mu g/ml) in 12 (1.8%) and pyrazinamide in 22 (3.3%) samples. Forty-six (6.8%) of the isolates tested were resistant to a single drug, 10 (1.5%) to two drugs, 12 (1.8%) to three drugs, and 6 (0.9 %) to four drugs, while 2 (0.3 %) isolates were resistant to all five first-line agents. Primary MDR-TB was 1.8% (n = 12) (INH 1 mu g/ml, RMP 5 mu g/ml). CONCLUSION: The results of this study show a prevalence of primary MDR-TB in Pakistan of < 2%, which needs to be addressed through an effective DOTS strategy.	primary drug resistance; MDR-TB; Pakistan	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; SURVEILLANCE
pub-1713	Microscopic-observation drug susceptibility assay provides rapid and reliable identification of MDR-TB	BACKGROUND: Liquid culture systems are more rapid and sensitive for both the detection and drug susceptibility testing (DST) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. SETTING: St Peter's TB Specialised Hospital and public health laboratory, Addis Ababa. OBJECTIVE: To compare the microscopic-observation drug susceptibility (MODS) assay with the BACTEC-MGIT 960 system for isoniazid and rifampicin DST (i.e., multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [MDR-TB] identification) of M. tuberculosis. DESIGN: The evaluation was based on 58 smear- and culture-positive sputum samples from patients diagnosed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. BACTEC-MGIT was used as the reference standard. RESULTS: For the detection of MDR-TB, MODS has a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy rate of respectively 95%, 100% and 98.3% (kappa 0.981, concordance 98.3%). Concurrent culture detection and DST results are obtained in a median of 9 days with MODS, while indirect DST results with BACTEC-MGIT are obtained in a median of 8 days (this does not include time to primary isolate). CONCLUSION: MODS is an accurate, rapid and relatively inexpensive method for the identification of MDR-TB.

pub-1714	Electronic tuberculosis surveillance systems: a tool for managing today's TB programs	The World Health Organization (WHO) released the Stop TB Strategy in 2006, along with a revised version of the tuberculosis (TB) recording and reporting forms and register. These publications illustrate the need for an enhanced TB surveillance system that will include such key elements as rapid assessment of the quality of DOTS services; integration and response to the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic; TB control challenges, such as increased smear-negative and extra-pulmonary TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB); increased engagement of all care providers, such as private health care services and the community; and promotion of research to support program improvement. Electronic surveillance systems utilize computer technology to facilitate the capture, transfer and reporting of the WHO-recommended TB data elements. Electronic surveillance offers several potential advantages over the traditional paper-based systems used in many low-resource settings, such as improved data quality and completeness, more feasible links to other health care programs, quality-enhanced data entry and analysis features and increased data security. These advantages must, however, be weighed against the requirements and costs of electronic surveillance, including implementation and support of a quality paper-based surveillance system and the additional costs associated with infrastructure, training and human resources for the implementation and continuing support of an electronic system. Using examples from three different electronic TB surveillance systems that are being implemented in various resource-limited settings, this article demonstrates the feasibility, requirements and value of such systems to support the WHO-recommended enhancement of TB surveillance.	tuberculosis; surveillance; electronic; TB-HIV	SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; HIV; EPIDEMIC
10.1016_S0929_6646_08_60145_X	Increasing drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in a medical center in northern Taiwan	Background/Purpose: This retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the drug resistance patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a medical center in northern Taiwan between 2003 and 2004 in comparison to those reported in 1990-1992. Methods: A total of 611 non-duplicate M. tuberculosis isolates from culture-proven tuberculosis (TB) cases were tested for drug susceptibility against five first-line anti-TB drugs in a clinical mycobacterial laboratory using the agar proportional method for isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB), and streptomycin (SM). The Wayne assay, which measures the activity of pyrazinamide (PZA), was used for PZA susceptibility testing. Results: Of 611 patients, including 510 males and 101 females, 70.2% of patients were older than 65 years. A total of 339 isolates (55.5%) were resistant to one or more drugs. Isolates from patients aged < 25 years showed a significantly higher drug resistance rate (79.2%) compared with other age groups (p = 0.0312). Single-drug resistance was observed in 97 (15.9%) of all isolates. Monoresistance to PZA (8.0%) was most frequent, followed by INH (5.1%), RIF (0.5%), EMB (1.6%), and SM (0.7%). Among the polydrug resistant isolates (PDR-TB), resistance rates were 35.5% for INH and 27.0% for RIF. One hundred and fifty-nine isolates (26.0%) were resistant to both INH and RIF (multidrug-resistant [MDR] TB); 94.6% of RIF-resistant isolates were also resistant to INH. The overall drug resistance rates and percentages of PDR-TB and MDR-TB increased over the 12-year study period (p < 0.001). Based on medical records, primary cases were identified in 486 (84.7%) out of 574 patients, and resistance to any drug was identified in 268 (55.1%) patients, of which 130 (26.7%) were MDR-TB. Among the 88 with recurrent TB, 54 (61.4%) were resistant to at least one drug, and MDR-TB was identified in 29 (33.0%) patients. A history of previous anti-TB therapy was a significant factor for overall drug resistance, PZA monoresistance, PDR-TB, and MDR-TB (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The emergence of M. tuberculosis isolates resistant to anti-TB agents in this hospital, and in particular among young patients, is alarming. Strict measures to control and prevent drug-resistant TB are urgently needed.	drug resistance; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Taiwan	
pub-1716	Evidence of primary transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the Western Province of Papua New Guinea	Objective: To review patient outcomes and the molecular epidemiology of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains isolated from patients living in the Western Province of Papua New Guinea (PNG) seeking treatment in Australia. Design, setting and participants: Review of all cases of MDR-TB among people living in the open border region between the Western Province of PNG and the Torres Strait Islands of Australia who presented to health clinics in the region between 2000 and 2006. All cases of suspected TB were bacteriologically confirmed at the time of presentation by the Mycobacterium Reference Laboratory in Brisbane. Main outcome measures: Drug resistance patterns; drug use and duration; molecular typing of TB strains; patient outcomes. Results: Between 2000 and 2006, 60 patients from the Western Province of PNG were diagnosed with TB, of which 15 had MDR-TB. Mortality was high, although no patient who was able to maintain access to supervised therapy died. All 15 MDR-TB isolates were Beijing-family strains showing the same unique mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit (MIRU) profile, with the exception of a single strain that differed by a single repeat at one locus. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing on 10 of these strains further differentiated them into two distinct clusters. Conclusion: Transmission of MDR-TB is occurring in the Western Province of PNG. Additional resources are urgently needed to interrupt the ongoing transmission of MDR-TB from the Western Province of PNG to the Torres Strait Islands. Good supervision and management of patient treatment, which includes ensuring a regular supply of second-line anti-TB drugs, are essential elements of TB control.

The objective of this work was to relate cases of MDR-TB occurring in Goias, a central state of Brazil. We related five cases of MDR-TB, three women and two men. All were pulmonary cases. Three were in their second treatment and two in their first treatment. Surgical pulmonary resection was performed in one case. One death occurred. Lack of adherence, gastric intolerance to anti-TB drugs and poor clinical management were the main aspects related to the emergent resistance. A revision of the main clinical aspects of this disease was performed.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; MDR-TB; Mycobacterium tuberculosis	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; SURGICAL INTERVENTION
10.2471_BLT.06.034991	Resistance to implementing policy change: the case of Ukraine	Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem in eastern Europe. Since 1990, the incidence rates of TB have continued to increase in Belarus, the Russian Federation, the Ukraine and the central Asian republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Eastern Europe, and in particular the Russian Federation and the Ukraine, also face the public health challenge of an escalating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) epidemic. Of the 17 283 global MDR-TB cases reported in 2004, over 60% (10 595) were from the European region and the vast majority of these from eastern Europe, including the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Of particular concern is the fact that, along with Africa, treatment success for DOTS in eastern Europe is substantially below average when compared with other regions of the world, and DOTS coverage and smear-positive case detection rate remain the lowest in the world. Collectively, along with Africa, these problems in eastern Europe remain the principal obstacle to meeting the Millennium Development Goals for TB in Europe. The Ukraine has worsening epidemics of TB, MDR-TB and HIV, against a background of epidemics of sexually transmitted illness (STI) and injecting drug users (IDUs). The TB and HIV epidemics are converging. In spite of attempts, the Ukraine has failed to implement DOTS policy due to health systems organization, financing and provider payment systems that created disincentives to change while opposition by policy-makers and clinicians to DOTS strategy hindered implementation efforts.

pub-1720	A randomised controlled trial of high-dose isoniazid adjuvant therapy for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: Tertiary care hospital in Kanpur, India. BACKGROUND: The need for a standardised treatment protocol for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in resource-limited countries is being increasingly recognised. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of high-dose isoniazid (INH) (16-18 mg/kg) adjuvant to second-line therapy in documented cases of MDR-TB. DESIGN: The present study is a double blind, randomised controlled trial with three treatment arms, highdose INH, normal-dose INH and placebo, in addition to second-line drugs. Primary outcomes of the study were time to sputum culture conversion and proportion with sputum culture negative 6 months after treatment initiation. Secondary outcomes were radiological improvement at 1 year post treatment and development of toxicity. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, subjects who received high-dose INH became sputum-negative 2.38 times (95%CI 1.45-3.91, P = 0.001) more rapidly than those who did not receive it, and had a 2.37 times (95%CI 1.46-3.84, P < 0.001) higher likelihood of being sputum-negative at 6 months. These subjects showed significantly better radiological improvement without an increased risk of INH toxicity. CONCLUSION: In low-resource scenarios where a standardised therapeutic protocol is used for MDR-TB, the protocol can be significantly improved by including highdose INH as an adjuvant.	randomised controlled trial; multidrugresistant tuberculosis; isoniazid	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; SYSTEM; INFECTIOUSNESS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; RIFAMPIN; IMPACT
10.5124_jkma.2008.51.2.168	Extensively drug resistance-tuberculosis, XDR-TB	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis(MDR-TB), resistant to at least the two main TB drugs-isoniazid and rifampicin, has been a threat to TB control because the treatment requires more toxic drugs and longer period with poor treatment outcomes. Recently, more serious concerns have been raised about extensively drug resistant-tuberculosis (XDR-TB), which shows resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides in addition to isoniazid and rifampicin. XDR-TB is a serious global health threat because the cure is very difficult as few sensitive anti-TB drugs remain. XDR-TB develops when first-and second-line anti-TB drugs are misused during the course of treatment, most commonly due to poor compliance of the patients to the treatment regimen. People with XDR-TB can pass the XDR-TB bacteria to other people. Thus, every effort should be made to prevent the development of XDR-TB by establishing an effective TB control program maximizing patient adherence to prescribed anti-TB regimen and minimizing contact of XDR-TB patients with other people to prevent the spread of XDR-TB.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; extensively drug-resistant	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS
10.1186_1471_2334_8_10	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Background: With almost 9 million new cases each year, tuberculosis remains one of the most feared diseases on the planet. Led by the STOP-TB Partnership and WHO, recent efforts to combat the disease have made considerable progress in a number of countries. However, the emergence of mutated strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that are resistant to the major anti-tuberculosis drugs poses a deadly threat to control efforts. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis ( MDR-TB) has been reported in all regions of the world. More recently, extensively drug resistant-tuberculosis ( XDR-TB) that is also resistant to second line drugs has emerged in a number of countries. To ensure that adequate resources are allocated to prevent the emergence and spread of drug resistance it is important to understand the scale of the problem. In this article we propose that current methods of describing the epidemiology of drug resistant tuberculosis are not adequate for this purpose and argue for the inclusion of population based statistics in global surveillance data. Discussion: Whereas the prevalence of tuberculosis is presented as the proportion of individuals within a defined population having disease, the prevalence of drug resistant tuberculosis is usually presented as the proportion of tuberculosis cases exhibiting resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs. Global surveillance activities have identified countries in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and regions of China as having a high proportion of MDR-TB cases and international commentary has focused primarily on the urgent need to improve control in these settings. Other regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa have been observed as having a low proportion of drug resistant cases. However, if one considers the incidence of new tuberculosis cases with drug resistant disease in terms of the population then countries of sub-Saharan Africa have amongst the highest rates of transmitted MDR-TB in the world. We propose that inclusion of population based statistics in global surveillance data is necessary to better inform debate on the control of drug resistant tuberculosis. Summary: Re-appraisal of global MDR-TB data to include population based statistics suggests that the problem of drug resistant tuberculosis in sub-Saharan Africa is more critical than previously perceived.

pub-1723	Genotypic diversity of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in South Africa	SETTING: The epidemiology of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), an emerging threat to TB control, is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To gain insight into the genotypic population structure of XDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in South Africa using a molecular approach and thereby determine whether XDR-TB is mainly acquired or transmitted. DESIGN: Sputum isolates from patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were submitted to the National Referral Laboratory for second-line drug susceptibility testing. The XDR-TB isolates were spoligotyped and these data were compared to the geographic origin of the isolate. RESULTS: Of the 699 MDR-TB isolates submitted for testing between June 2005 and December 2006, 101 (17%) patients had a culture that was resistant to either ofloxacin or kanamycin, and 41 (6%) were resistant to both drugs (XDR-TB). Spoligotyping of the XDR-TB isolates identified 17 genotypes. As a result of the high genotypic diversity and geographical distribution, we estimate that between 63% and 75% of cases developed XDR-TB through acquisition. CONCLUSION: Acquisition of extensive drug resistance appears to be the primary mechanism driving the XDR-TB epidemic in South Africa. This urgent TB control issue has to be addressed to prevent the spread of this potentially incurable disease.	mycobacterium tuberculosis; MDR-TB; XDR-TB	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; WESTERN CAPE
10.1080_17415990701845963	Synthesis and characterization of n-hydroxyalkyl and oxazolinyl ethionamide derivatives	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a serious problem worldwide, especially in people living with human immunodeficiency virus. In considering the MDR-TB problem, ethionamide (ETH) is a structural analog of isoniazid that is typically used when the patient exhibits resistance to the front-line drugs, being one of the most frequently used drugs, for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Due to the importance of ETH in TB treatment, the aim of our work was the synthesis and characterization of oxazolinyl (1,2) and N-hydroxyalkyl (3-5) ETH derivatives.	tuberculosis; ethionamide; oxazolinyl nucleus	TUBERCULOSIS

10.1002_ptr.2269	Activity against drug resistant-tuberculosis strains of plants used in Mexican traditional medicine to treat tuberculosis and other respiratory diseases	Tuberculosis (TB) kills about 3 million people per year worldwide. Furthermore, TB is an infectious disease associated with HIV patients, and there is a rise in multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases around the world. There is a need for new anti-TB agents. The study evaluated the antimycobacterial activity of nine plants used in Mexican traditional medicine to treat tuberculosis and other respiratory diseases. Nasturtium officinale showed the best activity (MIC = 100 mu g/mL) against the sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The following plants were active also but at 200 mu g/mL: Citrus sinensis, Citrus aurantifolia, Foeniculum vulgare, Larrea tridentata, Musa acuminata and Olea europaea. Contrary to the above data, activity against drug-resistant variants of M. tuberculosis was more evident, e.g. N. officinale was the most potent (MIC <= 100 mu g/mL) against the four mono-resistant variants tested; F. vulgare and O. europaea were active against all the resistant variants (MICs <= 100 mu g/mL). The most susceptible variant was the isoniazid resistant, being inhibited by C. aurantifolia, C. sinensis and O. europaea (MIC = 25 mu g/mL). These data point to the importance of biological testing of extracts against drug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates, and the bioguided assay of these extracts for the identification of lead compounds against MDR-TB isolates.

10.1196_annals.1425.009	Treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Tomsk, Russia - Developing programs that address the linkage between poverty and disease	Tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) are diseases of poverty. Because Mycobacterium tuberculosis exists predominantly in a social space often defined by poverty and its comorbidities-overcrowded or congregate living conditions, substance dependence or abuse, and lack of access to proper health services, to name a few-the biology of this organism and of TB drug resistance is intimately linked to the social world in which patients live. This association is demonstrated in Russia, where political changes in the 1990s resulted in increased socioeconomic inequality and a breakdown in health services. The effect on TB and MDR-TB is reflected both in terms of a rise in TB and MDR-TB incidence and increased morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. We present the case example of Tomsk Oblast to delineate how poverty contributed to a growing MDR-TB epidemic and increasing socioeconomic barriers to successful care, even when available. The MDR-TB pilot project implemented in Tomsk addressed both programmatic and socioeconomic factors associated with unfavorable outcomes. The result has been a strengthening of the overall TB control program in the region and improved case-holding for the most vulnerable patients. The model of MDR-TB care in Tomsk is applicable for other resource-poor settings facing challenges to TB and MDR-TB control.	drug-resistant tuberculosis; MDR-TB; DOTS-Plus; DOTS; poverty; Tomsk; inequality; Russia; Partners In Health; scaleup of MDR-TB treatment	SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; INITIAL-DRUG RESISTANCE; NEW-YORK-CITY; MDR-TB; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DOTS-PLUS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; SOCIOECONOMIC-FACTORS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; EDUCATIONAL-LEVEL
10.1159_000113932	Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-10 in whole blood is associated with disease progression in pulmonary mulitdrug-resistant tuberculosis patients	Background: Cytokine production profiles may reflect the clinical pictures of patients with tuberculosis ( TB). Objective: We examined the relationship between cytokine levels and clinical parameters indicating the state of disease in active pulmonary TB patients. Methods: We measured interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-10 levels in whole blood after stimulation with culture filtrate protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 33 multi-drug resistant (MDR)-TB and 51 non-MDR-TB patients. Results: No significant difference was found in IFN-gamma production between non-MDR-TB and MDR-TB patients, but there was a marked reduction in TNF-alpha production in MDR-TB patients accompanied by a moderate increase in IL-10 levels. In contrast, the presence of cavity was associated with a significant increase in IFN-gamma, whereas no difference in TNF-alpha between the cavity and non- cavity group was observed. Those who have TB lesions in the left lung showed lower levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha and higher IL-10 levels than the patients with lesions on the right side. IFN-gamma levels were significantly increased in those with moderate or advanced lesions compared with patients with mild lesions. TNF-alpha and IL-10 levels did not change with disease severity. The number of M. tuberculosis bacilli in sputum was closely associated with TNF-alpha levels. The patient group with high value (+++) of sputum culture acid-fast bacilli produced significantly reduced levels of TNF-alpha compared with medium (++) and low (+) values. Conclusion: These findings suggest that IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha or IL-10 production patterns in whole blood are associated with disease progression in active pulmonary TB. Copyright (C) 2008 S.

10.1111_j.1440_1843.2007.01201.x	Representative drug susceptibility patterns for guiding design of re-treatment regimens for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Iran	Background and objective: The prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has increased substantially in the past 20 years, however, there are no data specific to Iran. This study investigated patients suspected to have MDR-TB, attending the TB referral hospital in Iran. Methods: All patients suspected of having MDR-TB on hospital admission in the period 2003-2005 were included in this study. Sputum from all patients was tested for smear and culture, and drug sensitivity testing was performed using the proportion method. Patients were categorized into three groups based on their history of medical treatment. Group I consisted of patients with CAT I regimen failure; Group II consisted of patients with a history of CAT II regimen failure and Group III comprised patients with a history of more than two courses of irregular CAT I anti-TB regimen. Results: There were 105 patients recruited; 32 in Group I, 53 in Group II and 20 in Group III. There were no significant differences between the three groups in their resistance to first-line anti-TB drugs. Fifty-five patients were diagnosed with MDR-TB. The prevalence of MDR-TB was 56% (18 cases) in group I, 49% (26 cases) in group II and 55% (11 cases) in group III. No significant difference in the pattern of drug resistance was observed between the three groups. Conclusion: The prevalence of MDR-TB was high in this study. The lack of response of MDR-TB patients to CAT II treatment indicates that antibiotic sensitivity testing is essential in patients with CAT I treatment failure.	drug sensitivity test; Iran; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	MDR-TB; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; TREATMENT FAILURE; THERAPY; MANAGEMENT
10.1080_00365540802342372	Type 2 diabetes and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	The association between tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes is re-emerging with the epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). We analyzed retrospective data from 2878 TB patients across the Texas/Mexico border. Overall, 161/2878 (5.6%) patients had MDR TB (resistance to rifampin and isoniazid): Texas 49/1442 (3.4%) and Mexico 112/1436 (7.8%). In Texas, MDR TB was significantly associated with T2DM (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.2) when adjusted for age, gender, drug and alcohol abuse, HIV infection and history of previous episode of TB; and in Mexico (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.1-2.9) when adjusted for age and gender. Patients with T2DM in both countries were more likely to be compliant with DOTS therapy (Texas: OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.4) than patients without T2DM. In Texas, all but 3 of the T2DM patients with MDR TB were resistant at their first culture at the time of diagnosis. It is possible that impaired immunity in T2DM increases susceptibility to infection with resistant strains.		PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANT; PREVALENCE; MELLITUS; HEALTH
10.1016_j.tube.2007.08.008	SLC11A1 (formerly NRAMP1) polymorphisms associated with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	The solute carrier family 11 member 1 gene (SLC11A1, formerly known as NRAMP1: natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1) is one of the host genetic factors reported to affect susceptibility to tuberculosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether SLC11A1 polymorphisms affect the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and other clinical features of pulmonary tuberculosis. Using polymerase chain reaction and the restriction fragment-Length polymorphism analyses, we investigated four previously reported SLC11A1 polymorphisms, variations in 5'(GT)n, INT4, D543N, and 3'UTR in 95 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis including 10 MDR-TB patients. Clinical information, including elapsed time for sputum culture conversion, extent of pulmonary involvement, and presence or absence of cavitary Lesions, was based on a review of charts and chest radiographs. For the 10 MDR-TB patients, previous therapy and treatment compliance were also evaluated. Although the number of MDR-TB patients was small, our preliminary study showed that the variations of D543N and 3'UTR are significantly associated with the incidence of MDR-TB (odds ratio [OR] = 5.03, 95% confidence interval [Cl] 1.24-20.62; P = 0.02), longer time to sputum culture conversion (OR = 3.86, 95% Cl 1.23-12.23; P = 0.02), and cavity formation (OR = 5.04, 95% Cl = 1.51-23.13; P = 0.02). Three out of the 10 MDR-TB patients with good treatment compliance had at least one genetic variation in SLC11A1. These data suggested that genetic variations in SLC11A1 may affect the incidence of MDR-TB and clinical features of pulmonary tuberculosis. Further studies are needed to confirm this association with increased number of MDR-TB patients. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

pub-1733	Adverse reactions among patients being treated for MDR-TB in Tomsk, Russia	BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE: Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is challenging because of the toxicity of second-line medications. Little is known about whether adverse events impact treatment outcome. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case series of 244 MDR-TB patients enrolled in Tomsk between 10 September 2000 and 10 September 2002. Adverse reactions were determined by laboratory data and/or clinical criteria. A multiple logistic regression model was performed to determine whether the occurrence of adverse reactions was associated with poor treatment outcome. RESULTS: In this cohort, 76.0% were cured, 6.6% failed, 4.9% died and 11.5% defaulted. Adverse events were observed in 73.3% of patients, occurring in 74.8% of patients who were adherent (taking at least 80% of prescribed doses) and 59.1% of non-adherent individuals (P = 0.11). The impact of adverse events on outcome was modified by non-adherence; among adherent patients, the occurrence of any adverse reaction was associated with treatment cure (adjusted odds ratio 3.24, 95% confidence interval 1.56-6.70). CONCLUSION: Adverse reactions occurred frequently in MDR-TB patients in Tomsk, Russia, but did not negatively impact treatment outcome. The occurrence of adverse reactions among adherent patients was associated with treatment cure.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; DOTS-Plus; adverse reactions; Tomsk; Russia	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; DOTS-PLUS; PARADIGM; RIFAMPIN; OUTCOMES; COHORT; PRISON
10.1086_521121	Multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis: Implications for the HIV epidemic and antiretroviral therapy rollout in South Africa	Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is emerging as a major clinical and public health challenge in areas of sub-Saharan Africa where there is a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. TB drug-resistance surveillance in this region has been limited by laboratory capacity and the public health infrastructure; however, with the maturation of the HIV epidemic, the burden of drug-resistant TB is increasing rapidly. The recent discovery of large numbers of cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB in South Africa likely represents an unrecognized and evolving epidemic rather than sporadic, localized outbreaks. The combination of a large population of HIV-infected susceptible hosts with poor TB treatment success rates, a lack of airborne infection control, limited drug-resistance testing, and an overburdened MDR-TB treatment program provides ideal conditions for an MDR-TB and XDR-TB epidemic of unparalleled magnitude. In the present article, we review the history of drug-resistant TB in South Africa, describe its interaction with the HIV epidemic and the resultant consequences, and suggest measures necessary for controlling MDR-TB and XDR-TB in this context. A successful response to the emergence of MDR-TB and XDR-TB will necessitate increased resources for and collaboration between TB and HIV programs.

pub-1735	Open label trial of adjuvant immunotherapy with Dzherelo, Svitanok and Lizorm, in MDR-TB, XDR-TB and TB/HIV co-infected patients receiving anti-tuberculosis therapy under DOT	Open label trial of anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT) combined with oral immunomodulators derived from medicinal plants, Dzherelo, Svitanok, and Lizorm, was conducted in a representative group of 14 Ukrainian patients, half of whom (7) were dually infected with HIV. Among them 9 individuals had multidrug-resistant form of TB (MDR-TB) including 2 (22%) patients who presented with extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). Patients hospitalized in our TB dispensary were treated under directly observed therapy (DOT) until they became culture negative and their radiological and clinical symptoms improved. All patients, except one, gained weight, ranging between 3-17 kg with median gain of 9 kg (P=0.0002). The liver function tests revealed that the level of total bilirubin had decreased from 15.5 to 12 mol/L - an improvement that was statistically significant (P=0.03). Alanine transaminase (ALT), another marker of hepatic damage, declined from abnormally high 55.4 IU/L to a normal 38.2 IU/L level (P=0.03). The median time to bacterial clearance was 32 days. The mean duration of therapy was 3.9 months - shorter than average 12 months time needed to treat drug-resistant TB. These findings indicate that the combination of Ekomed's phytopreparations with ATT enhances the efficacy of TB therapy and is safe and beneficial even to patients with poor prognosis due to drug resistance and/or co-infection with HIV.

10.1007_s00063_007_1120_6	Antibiotic drug-resistant tuberculosis	Tuberculosis remains to be one of the most important infectious diseases worldwide. Among the estimated 9 million new cases that are anually recorded, antibiotic drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has become an increasing problem. Cases of multidrug resistance (MDR), by definition resistance against at least isoniazid and rifampin, are reported worldwide. Moreover, cases of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) with additional resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides are also emerging. Patients who are infected with MDR-TB strains need a carefully selected antibiotic combination therapy consisting of four to six alternative drugs according to the results of in vitro drug susceptibility testing. The duration of treatment against MDR-TB is cost-intensive, and is generally recommended for 18 months beyond the first time of sustained culture negativity. Patient adherence to the therapy is essential. As adverse effects of MDR-TB therapy are common, treatment of these patients should be guided by experienced physicians.	tuberculosis (TB); multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB); extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB); therapy	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MICROSCOPIC-OBSERVATION; CLINICAL SPECIMENS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; ASSAY; EFFICACY; RIFAMPIN; SYSTEM; SPUTUM; TB
10.1097_INF.0b013e31814523e4	Failure of chemoprophylaxis with standard antituberculosis agents in child contacts of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cases	Background: There is little published information on optimal chemoprophylaxis for children with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) contacts. Current guidelines of World Health Organization suggest that isoniazid (INH), the standard first-line chemoprophylaxis, be used for those exposed to MDR-TB. Methods: This is a retrospective review of medical records of 5 children residing in the Western Cape Province, South Africa, who developed MDR-TB while receiving conventional chemoprophylaxis with either INH or a combination of INH, rifampin, and pyrazinamide. Results: Adult MDR-TB source cases were identified for all children and resistance patterns of patient and source case isolates matched in all cases. The median age of the patients was 0.4 years. One patient participated in a trial of INH chemoprophylaxis for HIV-infected children. Four HIV-uninfected infants presented with TB-related symptoms several months after being given chemoprophylaxis because of a known source case. Stigmata of TB were cough >3 weeks in 4, weight loss or a history of failing to thrive in 3, fever in 2 infants, and reported night sweats in 1. Chest radiographs at diagnosis revealed lymphadenopathy, lobar opacification, and airway narrowing. All patients were treated for varying time periods at a TB referral institution in the Western Cape. Conclusions: Standard, first-line anti-TB agents were inadequate to prevent MDR-TB in children exposed to MDR-TB contacts. Second-line chemoprophylaxis, reflecting the susceptibility profile of the source case's isolate, with at least 2 drugs with activity against the drug-resistant isolate for 6-12 months should be considered.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; chemoprophylaxis; child	SOUTH-AFRICA; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; WESTERN-CAPE; FOLLOW-UP; INFECTION; THERAPY; TRIAL

10.1086_522537	Impact of extensive drug resistance on treatment outcomes in non-HIV-infected patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Background. Recently, serious concerns about extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), which shows resistance to second-line anti-TB drugs in addition to isoniazid and rifampicin, have been raised. The aim of this study was to elucidate the impact of extensive drug resistance on treatment outcomes in non-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Methods. Patients who received the diagnosis of and treatment as having MDR-TB at Seoul National University Hospital (Seoul, Republic of Korea) between January 1996 and December 2005 were included. The definition of XDR-TB was TB caused by bacilli showing resistance to both isoniazid and rifampicin and also showing resistance to any fluoroquinolone and to at least 1 of the following 3 injectable anti-TB drugs: capreomycin, kanamycin, and amikacin. To identify the impact of extensive drug resistance on treatment outcomes, univariate comparison and multiple logistic regression were performed. Results. A total of 211 non -HIV-infected patients with MDR-TB were included in the final analysis. Among them, 43 patients (20.4%) had XDR-TB. Treatment failure was observed in 19 patients (44.2%) with XDR-TB, whereas treatment of 46 patients (27.4%) with non-XDR-TB failed (P = .057). The presence of extensive drug resistance ( adjusted odds ratio [OR], 4.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35 - 14.74) and underlying comorbidity ( adjusted OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.00-6.87) were independent risk factors for treatment failure. However, a higher level of albumin was inversely associated with treatment failure (adjusted OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.97). Conclusion. The presence of extensive drug resistance, the presence of comorbidity, and hypoalbuminemia were independent poor prognostic factors in non - HIV-infected patients with MDR-TB.

10.1371_journal.pone.0001126	Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment Outcomes in Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan: Treatment Complexity and XDR-TB among Treatment Failures	Background. A pilot programme to treat multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was implemented in Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan in 2003. This region has particularly high levels of MDR-TB, with 13% and 40% among new and previously treated cases, respectively. Methodology. This study describes the treatment process and outcomes for the first cohort of patients enrolled in the programme, between October 2003 and January 2005. Confirmed MDR-TB cases were treated with an individualised, second-line drug regimen based on drug susceptibility test results, while suspected MDR-TB cases were treated with a standardised regimen pending susceptibility results. Principal Findings. Of 108 MDR-TB patients, 87 were started on treatment during the study period. Of these, 33 (38%) were infected with strains resistant to at least one second-line drug at baseline, but none had initial ofloxacin resistance. Treatment was successful for 54 (62%) patients, with 13 (15%) dying during treatment, 12 (14%) defaulting and 8 (8%) failing treatment. Poor clinical condition and baseline second-line resistance contributed to treatment failure or death. Treatment regimens were changed in 71 (82%) patients due to severe adverse events or drug resistance. Adverse events were most commonly attributed to cycloserine, ethionamide and p-aminosalicylic acid. Extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) was found among 4 of the 6 patients who failed treatment and were still alive in November 2006. Conclusions. While acceptable treatment success was achieved, the complexity of treatment and the development of XDR-TB among treatment failures are important issues to be addressed when considering scaling up MDR-TB treatment.		
10.1016_j.ijid.2007.01.009	Evidence of 'amplifier effect' in pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: report of three cases	Introduction: A cluster of three related cases of tuberculosis (TB) with primary multidrug resistance was investigated at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire of Kigali (CHUK) in Rwanda. The patients were HIV-1/2 seronegative. Patients 1 and 2 were hospitalized in the same room of CHUK for one month. Patient 3 was a younger sibling of patient 2. Methods: Drug susceptibility of two consecutive Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from each patient was tested by the BACTEC 460 radiometric method. DNA fingerprinting was performed using spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units of variable numbers of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) analysis. All patients initially received the World Health Organization category I regimen. Results: The isolates collected during the first TB episode were resistant to isoniazid, rifampin and ethambutol. After subsequent retreatment regimens with rifampin, isoniazid, streptomycin, pyrazinamide (8 months) and rifampin, isoniazid, streptomycin, pyrazinamide, ciprofloxacin (21 months), patients 1 and 2 developed additional resistance to streptomycin and quinolones. Patient 3 received only the category I regimen and consecutive isolates retained the initial drug susceptibility pattern. All isolates were genetically indistinguishable by spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR, indicating the same origin. Conclusions: These observations highlight the risk of nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB and the possible selection of secondary resistance to second-line drugs if a single new drug is added at the time of retreatment of MDR TB patients. 2007 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

pub-1742	Social support and incentives programme for patients with tuberculosis: experience from the Russian Federation	SETTING: Tuberculosis (TB) services including social support and incentive programmes in four Russian regions (Orel, Vladimir, Belgorod Oblasts and Republic of Mari-El). OBJECTIVES: To determine reasons for TB treatment default among non-adherent patients and to describe patient views of social support programmes and the organisation of treatment. METHODS: Standard anonymous questionnaires were administered to new pulmonary TB patients registered for treatment. RESULTS: A total of 87 non-adherent patients and 1302 adherent patients were interviewed. The leading reasons for treatment default given by non-adherent patients were the need to earn money (30%), alcohol use (30%) and not perceiving themselves as being sick (25%). Monetary incentives were preferred by the majority of patients (67%), followed by food/hot meals (41%) and transportation reimbursement (32%). Overall, among the proposed social support programmes, those that offered small daily incentives (23%) or a big final bonus (21%) were the most popular. The majority of patients (67%) preferred out-patient treatment. CONCLUSION: Collaboration between TB services and social organisations and substance abuse services as well as availability of psychological testing/counselling for patients are social support modalities for improving adherence suggested by study findings. Social support should be combined with a patient-centred approach to TB treatment.

pub-1743	Tuberculosis and multidrug resistance in Zambian prisons, 2000-2001	BACKGROUND: Data on prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Zambian prisons are lacking. METHODS: Between January 2000 and July 2001, a case-finding study was performed in 13 Zambian prisons for pulmonary TB. Prisoners were administered a questionnaire to obtain demographic information. Information regarding housing density and diet was also collected. Three consecutive first morning sputum specimens were cultured for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Antimicrobial resistance testing was performed by the resistance ratio method. RESULTS: A total of 10 8 0 prisoners were recruited: 105 5 were males and 25 females. Sputum from 245 (22.7%) prisoners yielded M. tuberculosis, including 168 (15.6%) with smear-positive disease. Based on a total prison population of 6118, the minimal prevalence of TB was 4.0%. There was a linear relationship between the proportion of prisoners evaluated and the prevalence of TB (R-2 = 0.9366) across facilities, suggesting that the true prevalence of TB may approach 15-20%. Resistance to at least one anti-tuberculosis drug was detected for 40 (23.8%) isolates, while MDR-TB was identified for 16 (9.5%) isolates. CONCLUSION: There is a high rate of pulmonary TB in Zambian prisons, with significant rates of drug resistance and MDR-TB, highlighting the need for active surveillance and treatment programs.	prisons; tuberculosis; surveillance; Zambia	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; MALAWI; PREVALENCE; HIV; TB
10.1186_1472_6947_7_33	A web-based laboratory information system to improve quality of care of tuberculosis patients in Peru: functional requirements, implementation and usage statistics	"Background: Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis patients in resource-poor settings experience large delays in starting appropriate treatment and may not be monitored appropriately due to an overburdened laboratory system, delays in communication of results, and missing or error-prone laboratory data. The objective of this paper is to describe an electronic laboratory information system implemented to alleviate these problems and its expanding use by the Peruvian public sector, as well as examine the broader issues of implementing such systems in resource-poor settings. Methods: A web-based laboratory information system "" e-Chasqui"" has been designed and implemented in Peru to improve the timeliness and quality of laboratory data. It was deployed in the national TB laboratory, two regional laboratories and twelve pilot health centres. Using needs assessment and workflow analysis tools, e-Chasqui was designed to provide for improved patient care, increased quality control, and more efficient laboratory monitoring and reporting. Results: Since its full implementation in March 2006, 29,944 smear microscopy, 31,797 culture and 7,675 drug susceptibility test results have been entered. Over 99% of these results have been viewed online by the health centres. High user satisfaction and heavy use have led to the expansion of e-Chasqui to additional institutions. In total, e-Chasqui will serve a network of institutions providing medical care for over 3.1 million people. The cost to maintain this system is approximately US$ 0.53 per sample or 1% of the National Peruvian TB program's 2006 budget. Conclusion: Electronic laboratory information systems have a large potential to improve patient care and public health monitoring in resource-poor settings. Some of the challenges faced in these settings, such as lack of trained personnel, limited transportation, and large coverage areas, are obstacles that a well-designed system can overcome. e-Chasqui has the potential to provide a national TB laboratory network in Peru. Furthermore, the core functionality of e-Chasqui as been implemented in the open source medical record system OpenMRS http:// www.openmrs.org for other countries to use."

10.1183_09031936.00077307	Clinical and operational value of the extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis definition	"Currently, no information is available on the effect of resistance/susceptibility to first-line drugs different from isoniazid and rifampicin in determining the outcome of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) patients, and whether being XDR-TB is a more accurate indicator of poor clinical outcome than being resistant to all first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs. To investigate this issue, a large series of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and XDR-TB cases diagnosed in Estonia, Germany, Italy and the Russian Federation during the period 1999-2006 were analysed. Drug-susceptibility testing for first- and second-line anti-TB drugs, quality assurance and treatment delivery was performed according to World Health Organization recommendations in all study sites. Out of 4,583 culture-positive TB cases analysed, 361 (7.9%) were MDR and 64 (1.4%) were XDR. XDR-TB cases had a relative risk (RR) of 1.58 to have an unfavourable outcome compared with MDR-TB cases resistant to all first-line drugs (isonlazid, rifampicin ethambutol, streptomycin and, when tested, pyrazinamide), and an RR of 2.61 compared with ""other"" MDR-TB cases (those susceptible to at least one first-line anti-TB drug among ethambutol, pyrazinamide and streptomycin, regardless of resistance to the second-line drugs not defining XDR-TB). The emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis confirms that problems in tuberculosis management are still present in Europe. While waiting for new tools which will facilitate management of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, accessibility to quality diagnostic and treatment services should be urgently ensured and adequate public health policies should be rapidly implemented to prevent further development of drug resistance."	clinical value; drug resistance; extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; tuberculosis	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS
10.1111_j.1574_6968.2007.00905.x	Specific mutations in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis rpoB gene are associated with increased dnaE2 expression	In Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), rifampicin resistance is almost invariably due to mutations in the rpoB gene, whose function is critical for cell viability. Most of these mutations, at least initially, impair the fitness of the bacteria but confer a selective advantage when antibiotic pressure is exerted. Subsequent adaptation may be critical to restore fitness. The possibility was considered that MTB with mutations in the rpoB gene elicits a constitutive stress response, increasing the probability of subsequent adaptation. In order to test this hypothesis, the expression of recA and dnaE2, an inducible putative error-prone DNA polymerase, was determined in six different isogenic laboratory-generated rpoB-mutants of MTB. Expression levels were determined with real-time PCR and the data obtained were compared with those of the wild-type parent. In four of the six rpoB mutants, a two- to fivefold induction of dnaE2 was detected (P < 0.05). Thus, the presence of specific mutations in rpoB is not only associated with impaired fitness but also results in a detectable, moderate yet persistent increase in the expression of dnaE2 but not recA.	dnaE2; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; drug resistance; MDR-TB; evolution	ESCHERICHIA-COLI; ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE; RIFAMPIN RESISTANCE; BACILLUS-SUBTILIS; RNA-POLYMERASE; EVOLUTION; FREQUENCIES; SURVIVAL; MUTANTS; FITNESS
pub-1748	A public-private partnership for TB control in Timika, Papua province, Indonesia	SETTING: A district-level tuberculosis (TB) control programme in Papua Province, Indonesia. OBJECTIVE: To describe a successful partnership between the District Health Department, a private company and non-governmental health care providers. METHODS: Routinely collected surveillance data were analysed. A conceptual model was constructed to describe TB control in the district. Data were compared with the National TB Control Programme (NTP) performance indicators. RESULTS: Funding for the programme's TB clinic is provided by a private company (PT Freeport Indonesia). The NTP provides the policy framework, treatment guidelines and some supplies. TB clinic staff are included in training programmes and the TB laboratory in the provincial quality assurance system. TB clinic staff are responsible for diagnosis, treatment, default tracing, recording and reporting, health education and community mobilisation. The largest proportion of TB patient referrals came from the community hospital (41%). The TB notification rate (311/100000), TB-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) co-infection (12%) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB (2%) are significantly higher in Mimika, but the treatment success rate for smear-positive patients (91%) is similar to Indonesian national figures. CONCLUSIONS: For true progress in attaining the United Nations Millennium Development Goals for TB in Indonesia, innovative local solutions utilising public-private partnerships are essential. The Mimika model is one such solution that should be tested elsewhere.	tuberculosis; health services; public-private partnership; Indonesia	TUBERCULOSIS-CONTROL; SULAWESI; DISTRICT; RATES; INDIA; MIX

pub-1750	Multidrug resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a tertiary hospital	Objective: The magnitude of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (MDR-TB) in Nigeria, the most populous country in sub-Saharan Africa, is largely unknown. This information would assist policymakers to develop intervention strategies against tuberculosis (TB) in the country. Materials and Methods: This is a one-year laboratory-based study. Specimens from suspected new TB patients sent to the TB laboratory of the Department of Medical Microbiology, University College Hospital lbadan, Nigeria from May 1, 2005 to April 27, 2006 were processed and analyzed. The specimens were stained with Ziehl-Neelsen (Z-N) reagents and cultured on Lowenstein-Jensen medium, incubated at 37 degrees C for 6-8 weeks. Isolates were confirmed as MDR-TB by Z-N reactions and biochemical methods. Drug susceptibility to streptomycin, ethambutol, rifampicin and isoniazid was done using Bactec 460 TB radiometric method. Results: Of the 1, 120 specimens processed, 80 (7.1%) were smear positive, while 56 (5.0%) were culture positive, even though the association was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Culture contamination rate was 8.8%. Thirty (53.6%) of the culture positive isolates were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin, while 26 (46.4%) were susceptible. About half-53.3%-of the resistant isolates were from the antiretroviral clinic, while 10 (33.4%) were from peripheral centers. Conclusion: This study shows that MDR-TB is emerging in Nigeria. Further studies on MDR-TB are urgently needed in the country to ascertain the magnitude of the problem and to proffer solutions to it.	prevalence; tuberculosis; sub-Saharan Africa	
pub-1751	Drug-resistant tuberculosis in children	Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), and especially multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB (i.e. resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin with or without resistance to other drugs) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB (i.e. MDR resistance plus resistance to the fluoroquinolones and one of the second-line injectables - kanamycin, amikacin or capreomycin),(1) has very important implications for affected children and the TB control programme. These children are difficult to manage because of the increased adverse effects of the second-line anti-TB drugs and the prolonged duration of treatment. Furthermore, they are often diagnosed late because the history of a drug-resistant contact was not obtained or responded to. Children mainly have paucibacillary disease, which means that diagnosis of a child, especially with MDR TB, usually points to recent transmission in the community and therefore a failure of the TB control programme.

10.1021_jm070391t	Inhibition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, and Mycobacterium avium by novel dideoxy nucleosides	The prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) and mutidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has been increasing, leading to serious infections, high mortality, and a global health threat. Here, we report the identification of a novel class of dideoxy nucleosides as potent and selective inhibitors of Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A series of 5-acetylenic derivatives of 2 ',3 '-dideoxyuridine (3-8) and 3 '-fluoro-2 ',3 '-dideoxyuridine (22-27) were synthesized and tested for their antimycobacterial activity against M. bovis, M. tuberculosis, and M. avium. 2 ',3 '-Dideoxyuridine possessing 5-decynyl, 5-dodecynyl, 5-tridecynyl, and 5-tetradecynyl substituents (4-7) exhibited the highest antimycobacterial activity against all three mycobacteria. In contrast, in the 3 '-fluoro-2 ',3 '-dideoxyuridine series, a 5-tetradecynyl analogue (26) displayed the most potent activity against these mycobacteria. Among other derivatives, 5-bromo-2',3'-dideoxycytidine (11), 5-methyl-2 ',3 '-dideoxycytidine (12). and 5-chloro-4-thio-2 ',3 '-dideoxyuridine (19) exhibited modest inhibition of M. bovis and M. tuberculosis. In the series of dideoxy derivatives of adenosine, guanosine, and purines, 2-amino-6-mercaptoethyl-9-(2,3-dideoxy-beta-D-glyceropentofuranosyl)purine (32) and 2-amino-4-fluoro-7-(2,3-dideoxy-beta-D-glyceropentofuranosyl)pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (35) were the most efficacious against M. bovis and M. tuberculosis, and All. avium, respectively.

10.1016_j.ijid.2006.12.004	Subcutaneously administered interferon-gamma for the treatment of multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis	Objective: We evaluated the clinical and laboratory effects of subcutaneously administered interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the treatment of chronic and advanced multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Design: Eight patients with sputum smear and culture persistently positive MDR-TB were subcutaneously administered 2 million international units of recombinant human IFN-gamma three times a week for 24 weeks (72 doses total) between December 2002 and May 2003. Subjects also received a customized drug regimen containing second- and third-time antituberculosis agents based upon drug susceptibility testing and previous treatment history. Results: Body weight remained stable or slightly decreased in all subjects during the study period, and none displayed radiographic improvement on serial chest computed tomography scanning. Sputum smears and cultures remained positive for all patients, and there was no increase in the mean time to yield a positive culture (from 16.5 +/- 6.4 to 11.8 +/- 4.9 days). There was no enhancement of cell-mediated immune responses in terms of production of IFN-gamma or IL-10, or of composition of lymphocytes among peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In four patients, therapy was discontinued because of adverse reactions. Conclusion: In patients with chronic and advanced MDR-TB, subcutaneous IFN-gamma treatment did not result in improvement in clinical, radiologic, microbiologic, or immunologic parameters.

pub-1754	The role of surgery and fluoroquinolones in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: Although modern tuberculosis treatment relies on chemotherapy, surgery is accepted as adjuvant treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of resectional surgery and fluoroquinolones on long-term treatment success and survival in a large group of MDR-TB cases. DESIGN: A total of 252 patients with MDR-TB were included in this retrospective cohort study. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine independent predictive factors for long-term treatment success, and survival analyses were done based on different treatment approaches with or without surgery. R E S U LT S: The mean age of the study cohort was 37.9 +/- 12.5 years; 204 (80%) were males. Long-term treatment success was associated with resistance to fewer drugs, female sex, younger age and limited disease. Sixty-six patients (26.2%) had undergone resectional surgery after 2-16 months of treatment. The highest long-term treatment success and survival rates were achieved in patients who both received fluoroquinolones and underwent surgery (P = 0.001 vs. other groups). CONCLUSION: Although the treatment success rate was higher in patients treated with surgery and fluoroquinolones compared to other groups, an additional significant benefit from surgery could not be demonstrated. Larger scale studies are needed to clarify this issue.	tuberculosis; multidrug resistance; surgery; fluoroquinolone	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; RIFAMPIN

10.1016_j.jsb.2007.04.009	Crystallographic studies on the binding of isonicotinyl-NAD adduct to wild-type and isoniazid resistant 2-trans-enoyl-ACP (CoA) reductase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis	The resumption of tuberculosis led to an increased need to understand the molecular mechanisms of drug action and drug resistance, which should provide significant insight into the development of newer compounds. Isoniazid (INH), the most prescribed drug to treat TB, inhibits an NADH-dependent enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA) that provides precursors of mycolic acids, which are components of the mycobacterial cell wall. InhA is the major target of the mode of action of isoniazid. INH is a pro-drug that needs activation to form the inhibitory INH-NAD adduct. Missense mutations in the inhA structural gene have been identified in clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to INH. To understand the mechanism of resistance to INH, we have solved the structure of two InhA mutants (121V and S94A), identified in INH-resistant clinical isolates, and compare them to INH-sensitive WT InhA structure in complex with the INH-NAD adduct. We also solved the structure of unliganded INH-resistant S94A protein, which is the first report on apo form of InhA. The salient features of these structures are discussed and should provide structural information to improve our understanding of the mechanism of action of, and resistance to, INH in M. tuberculosis. The unliganded structure of InhA allows identification of conformational changes upon ligand binding and should help structure-based drug design of more potent antimycobacterial agents.

10.1099_mic.0.2007_007864_0	Selection of transposon mutants of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with increased macrophage infectivity identifies fadD23 to be involved in sulfolipid production and association with macrophages	Alterations to the composition or architecture of the mycobacterial cell envelope can affect the macrophage infectivity of the bacillus. To further characterize the mycobacterial gene products that modulate the interaction with host cells, we employed transposon mutagenesis and screened for mutants that demonstrated an enhanced binding affinity toward macrophages. After successive rounds of mutant selection and enrichment, a total of five mutants were isolated that harboured gene disruptions within loci involved in lipid synthetic pathways as well as genes coding for putative hypothetical proteins. One mutant in particular, with a disruption in the Rv3826 gene (fadD23), was repeatedly isolated during library screening. Analysis of the cell envelope constituents of the Tn:: fadD23 strain revealed a lack of sulfolipid production which was restored following complementation with the wild-type gene.

pub-1758	Evaluation of a rapid screening test for rifampicin resistance in re-treatment tuberculosis patients in the Eastern Cape	Background and objectives. Patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) are at high risk of treatment failure. It is anticipated that early identification of MDR-TB and appropriate treatment will improve patient outcome and disease control. We evaluated the rapid detection of rifampicin resistance in previously treated TB patients, directly from acid-fast bacilli (AFB)-positive sputum using a phage-based test, FASTPlaque-Response (Biotec Laboratories Ltd, Ipswich, UK). The ability of rifampicin resistance to predict MDR-TB was also determined. Design. A prospective study was done comparing performance of the rapid phage test with conventional culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) in AFB-positive TB patients. Setting. Five primary health clinics and one TB referral centre in the Port Elizabeth Metropolitan area, Eastern Cape. Outcome measures. Sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy of the phage test were determined compared with gold standard culture and DST. Discrepant results were resolved by molecular detection of mutations conferring rifampicin resistance. The proportion of rifampicin-resistant strains that were MDR was also determined. Results. Previously treated patients were at a high risk of MDR-TB (35.7%). Sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy of FASTPlaque-Response for rifampicin resistance determination were 95.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 91.0-99.8%), 97.2% (95% CI: 94.5-99.9%) and 96.5% (95% CI: 94.1-98.9%) respectively compared with conventional DST (unresolved), calculated for specimens that had both FASTPlaque-Response and conventional DST results available. FASTPlaque-Response results were available in 2 days instead of 28-85 days with conventional DST. However, only 70.6% of FASTPlaque-Response results were interpretable compared with 86.3% of conventional DST results. The majority (95.5%) of rifampicin-resistant strains were MDR-TB. Conclusions. Rapid detection of rifampicin resistance using FASTPlaque-Response could contribute to improved management of patients at risk of MDR-TB, such as previously treated patients. However, improvement in control of specimen-related contamination is needed to ensure that a higher proportion of FASTPlaque-Response results are interpretable. Where indicated, early modification of therapy could improve patient, prognosis and reduce disease transmission.

10.1016_j.bmc.2007.04.012	Disaccharide analogs as probes for glycosyltransferases in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Glycosyltransferases (GTs) play a crucial role in mycobacterial cell wall biosynthesis and are necessary for the survival of mycobacteria. Hence, these enzymes are potential new drug targets for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), especially multiple drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Herein, we report the efficient syntheses of Araf(alpha 1 -> 5)Araf, Ga1f(beta 1 -> 5)Galf and Galf(beta 1 -> 6)Galf disaccharides possessing a 5-N,N-dimethylaminonaphthalene-l-sulfonamidoethyl (dansyl) unit that were prepared as fluorescent disaccharide acceptors for arabinosyl- and galactosyl-transferases, respectively. Such analogs may offer advantages relative to radiolabeled acceptors or donors for studying the enzymes and for assay development and compound screening. Additionally, analogs possessing a 5-azidonaphthalene-1-sulfonamidoethyl unit were prepared as photoaffinity probes for then-potential utility in studying active site labeling of the GTs (arabinosyl and galactosyl) in MYcobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Beyond their preparation, initial biological testing and kinetic analysis of these disaccharides as acceptors toward glycosyltransferases are also presented. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

10.1021_bi700688x	Rv1106c from Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase	New approaches are required to combat Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), especially the multi-drug resistant and extremely drug resistant organisms (MDR-TB and XDR-TB). There are many reports that mycobacteria oxidize 3 beta-hydroxysterols to 3-ketosteroids, but the enzymes responsible for this activity have not been identified in mycobacterial species. In this work, the Rv1106c gene that is annotated as a 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in Mtb has been cloned and heterologously expressed. The purified enzyme was kinetically characterized and found to have a pH optimum between 8.5 and 9.5. The enzyme, which is a member of the short chain dehydrogenase superfamily, uses NAD(+) as a cofactor and oxidizes cholesterol, pregnenolone, and dehydroepiandrosterone to their respective 3-keto-4-ene products. The enzyme forms a ternary complex with NAD(+) binding before the sterol. The enzyme shows no substrate preference for dehydroepiandrosterone versus pregnenolone with second-order rate constants (k(cat)/K-m) of 3.2 +/- 0.4 and 3.9 +/- 0.9 mu M-1 min(-1), respectively, at pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM MgCl2, and saturating NAD(+). Trilostane is a competitive inhibitor of dehydroepiandrosterone with a K-i of 197 +/- 8 mu M. The expression of the 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in Mtb is intracellular. Disruption of the 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase gene in Mtb abrogates mycobacterial cholesterol oxidation activity. These data are consistent with the Rv1106c gene being the one responsible for 3 beta-hydroxysterol oxidation in Mtb.

10.1128_AAC.01164_06	Inhaled large porous particles of capreomycin for treatment of tuberculosis in a guinea pig model	Capreomycin is used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), but it is limited therapeutically by its severe side effects. The objectives of the present studies were (i) to design low-density porous capreomycin sulfate particles for efficient pulmonary delivery to improve local and systemic drug bioavailability and capacity to reduce the bacillary load in the lungs in a manner similar to that achieved with intramuscular injections; (ii) to determine pharmacokinetic parameters after pulmonary administration of these capreomycin particles; and (iii) to evaluate the efficacy of these particles in treating animals in a small-aerosol-inoculum guinea pig model of TB. Capreomycin particles were manufactured by spray drying and characterized in terms of size and drug content. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental methods with healthy guinea pigs after administration of capreomycin particles by insufflation. The efficacy of the particles was evaluated by histopathological analysis and in terms of wet organ weight and bacterial burden in TB-infected animals. Lungs of animals receiving a 14.5-mg/kg dose of capreomycin particles showed significantly lower wet weights and smaller bacterial burdens than those of animals receiving any other treatment. These results were supported by histopathological analysis. The feasibility of inhaling capreomycin in a novel powder form, with the ultimate objective of the treatment of MDR-TB, is demonstrated by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies with guinea pigs. If applied to humans with MDR-TB, such a therapeutic approach might simplify drug delivery by eliminating injections and might reduce adverse effects through lowering the dose.

10.2471_BLT.06.038067	Evaluating the potential impact of the new Global Plan to Stop TB: Thailand, 2004-2005	Objective WHO's new Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-2015 advises countries with a high burden of tuberculosis (TB) to expand case-finding in the private sector as well as services for patients with HIV and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). The objective of this study was to evaluate these strategies in Thailand using data from the Thailand TB Active Surveillance Network, a demonstration project begun in 2004. Methods In October 2004, we began contacting public and private health-care facilities monthly to record data about people diagnosed with TB, assist with patient care, provide HIV counselling and testing, and obtain sputum samples for culture and susceptibility testing. The catchment area included 3.6 million people in four provinces. We compared results from October 2004-September 2005 (referred to as 2005) to baseline data from October 2002-September 2003 (referred to as 2003). Findings In 2005, we ascertained 5841 TB cases (164/100 000), including 2320 new smear-positive cases (65/100 000). Compared with routine passive surveillance in 2003, active surveillance increased reporting of all TB cases by 19% and of new smear-positive cases by 13%. Private facilities diagnosed 634 (11 %) of all TB cases. In 2005, 1392 (24%) cases were known to be HIV positive. The proportion of cases with an unknown HIV status decreased from 66% (3226/4904) in 2003 to 23% (1329/5841) in 2005 (P < 0,01). Of 4656 pulmonary cases, mycobacterial culture was performed in 3024 (65%) and MDR-TB diagnosed in 60 (1 %). Conclusion In Thailand, piloting the new WHO strategy increased case-finding and collaboration with the private sector, and improved HIV services for TB patients and the diagnosis of MDR-TB. Further analysis of treatment outcomes and costs is needed to assess this programme's impact and cost effectiveness.		CD4 LYMPHOCYTE COUNTS; TUBERCULOSIS-CONTROL; AFRICAN PATIENTS; HIV; EVOLUTION
10.2471_BLT.06.037630	Tuberculosis in complex emergencies	"This paper describes the key factors and remaining challenges for tuberculosis (TB) control programmes in complex emergencies. A complex emergency is ""a humanitarian crisis in a country, region or society where there is total or considerable breakdown of authority resulting from internal or external conflict and which requires an international response that goes beyond the mandate or capacity of any single agency and/or the ongoing United Nations country programme."" Some 200 million people are believed to live in countries affected by complex emergencies; almost all of these are developing countries that also bear the main burden of TB. The effects of complex emergencies impact on TB control programmes, interfering with the goals of identifying and curing TB patients and possibly leading to the emergence of MDR-TB. There are many detailed descriptions of aid interventions during complex emergencies; yet TB control programmes are absent from most of these reports. If TB is neglected, it may quickly result in increased morbidity and mortality, as was demonstrated in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Somalia. TB is a major disease in complex emergencies and requires an appropriate public health response. While there is no manual to cover complex emergencies, the interagency manual for TB control in refugee and displaced populations provides valuable guidance. These programmes con-tribute to the body of evidence needed to compile such a manual, and should ensure that the experiences of TB control in complex emergencies lead to the establishment of evidence-based programmes."

10.1111_j.1365_2249.2007.03406.x	Evaluation of T cell immune responses in multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients to Mycobacterium tuberculosis total tipid antigens	Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipid antigens produce significant T cell responses in healthy tuberculin reactor [purified protein derivative (PPD-positive] individuals. In the present study, proliferation and interferon (IFN)-gamma/ interleukin (IL)-4 responses were analysed to M. tuberculosis total lipid antigens in T lymphocytes from 25 patients with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The obtained results were compared with those of 30 asymptomatic healthy PPD-positive and 30 healthy tuberculin skin test negative (PPD-negative) subjects. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and T cells (CD4(+) and CD8(+)) were stimulated using autologous immature dendritic cells. Proliferation responses were assessed using 3-{4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl}-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT). IFN-gamma/IL-4 concentrations in the supernatant of the CD4(+) and CD8(+)T cells were measured by enzyme-linked inummosorbent assay. Proliferation assay showed that the peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD4(+) T cells from the MDR-TB patients responded significantly less to the M. tuberculosis total lipid antigens than to the CD4(+) T cells in the PPD-positive subjects. Total lipid antigen-specific proliferative responses in the CD8(+) T cells from the MDR-TB patients were minimally detected and the responses were similar to those of the PPD-positive subjects. IFN-gamma production by the CD4(+)T cells stimulated by total lipid antigens from the MDR-TB patients was decreased significantly compared with the PPD-positive individuals, whereas IL-4 production in the patients was elevated. IFN-gamma and IL-4 production in the CD8(+) T cells of the MDR-TB patients was similar to those of the PPD-positive subjects. In conclusion, it is suggested that stimulated CD4(+) T cells by M. tuberculosis total lipid antigens may be shifted to T helper 2 responses in MDR-TB patients.	interferon-gamma; interleukin-4; multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis; T cells; total lipid antigens	BLOOD MONONUCLEAR-CELLS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; GAMMA-INTERFERON; IFN-GAMMA; INFECTION; RECOGNITION; CD8(+); INTERLEUKIN-4; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION
pub-1765	Molecular investigation of recurrent tuberculosis in patients from Rwanda	SETTING: Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients enrolled in four provinces of Rwanda. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cause of recurrent TB. DESIGN: Serial Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates obtained from patients with recurrent TB from January 2002 to September 2005 were genotyped by spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number of tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing. Drug resistance was determined by phenotypic susceptibility testing and sequencing of rpoB, katG, inhA and embB genes. RESULTS: Among 710 culture-positive TB patients enrolled in the study, initial drug susceptibility testing results were available for 638. Sixty-nine of these had multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB and 569 were non-MDR-TB. Among the MDR-TB patients, 22 had follow-up isolates after cure (n = 12) or chronic infection (n = 10). The DNA patterns of sequential isolates from 4 of the 12 previously cured MDR-TB patients were different, indicating re-infection. DNA patterns of isolates from the remaining 8 previously cured and 10 chronic MDR-TB patients were identical, suggesting reactivation and treatment failure, respectively. Among the non-MDR-TB patients, disease recurrence was observed in one case; this was determined to be due to reactivation after initial mixed infection. CONCLUSION: These results document a high treatment failure/reactivation rate for MDR-TB and suggest that re-infection within 2 years may not be a common cause of recurrent TB in this setting.

10.3346_jkms.2007.22.4.677	Drug resistance rates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis at a private referral center in Korea	The goals of this study were to identify first-line drug resistance in new and previously treated tuberculosis (TB) cases and to determine risk factors for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) at a private referral center in Korea. All patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB over a 2-yr period between July 2002 and June 2004 were prospectively included in this study. In total, 637 patients were included; 512 (80.4%) were new cases, and 125 (19.6%) were previously treated cases. Resistance to at least one first-line drug was identified in 11.7% of new cases and 41.6% of previously treated cases. MDR-TB was detected in 3.9% of new cases and 27.2% of previously treated cases. The proportion of extensively drug-resistant TB among MDR-TB patients was 16.7% (9/54). Factors associated with MDR-TB included age under 45 yr, previous TB treatment, and the presence of cavitation on chest radiography. Rates of first-line drug resistance are high, particularly in previously treated patients, in the private sector in Korea. This underscores the need for an improved control program, coupled with early diagnosis of MDR-TB, to reduce the spread and development of resistance.

pub-1767	Evaluation of the accuracy of the microplate Alamar Blue assay for rapid detection of MDR-TB in Peru	Tuberculosis control is hampered by the widespread increase in multidrug resistance. Rapid drug susceptibility testing would greatly aid in the adequate treatment of the disease. This study evaluates the usefulness of the colorimetric method using Alamar Blue for the rapid detection of resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid in 63 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Peru. Results obtained by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and measures of gain in certainty showed greater diagnostic accuracy than with the gold standard, the proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium.	tuberculosis; MABA; drug resistance; accuracy	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; RESISTANCE
pub-1768	Pregnancies complicated by multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and HIV co-infection in Durban, South Africa	SETTING: Tertiary hospitals in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) co-infection during pregnancy on maternal and perinatal outcome. DESIGN: Prospective study performed between 1996 and 2001. Symptomatic pregnant women were investigated for TB. Those with confirmed MDR-TB were reported on. RESULTS: Three of five pregnant women with MDRTB were HIV-1 co-infected. One woman decided to terminate the pregnancy and one experienced pre-term lahour. Two neonates had features of growth restriction. CONCLUSION: Management of pregnant women with MDR-TB in an HIV-endemic area is possible in developing countries.

10.1093_jac_dkm085	Antimycobacterial activity of novel 1-(5-cyclobutyl-1,3-oxazol-2-yl)-3-(sub)phenyl/pyridylthiourea compounds endowed with high activity toward multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Objectives: The objective of this work was to synthesize 15 new 1-(5-cyclobutyl-1,3-oxazol-2-yl)-3-(sub)phenyl/pyridylthiourea compounds and evaluate their in vitro and in vivo anti mycobacterial activities. Methods: 5-Cyclobutyloxazol-2-amine was reacted with 1,1'-thiocarbonyldiimidazole, followed by various substituted anilines and 2-amino pyridines to yield the 15 compounds, which were subjected to in vitro and in vivo evaluation against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (MTB) and a clinical isolate of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Results: Among the 15 compounds screened, 7 compounds inhibited both MTB and MDR-TB in vitro with MICs of < 1 mu M. In the in vivo screening, compound 1-(5-cyclobutyl-1,3-oxazol-2-yl)-3-(2'-trifluoromethyl)phenylthiourea (compound 8) was equally active as isoniazid at the same dose level. Conclusions: Compound 8 was found to be the most active, with an in vitro MIC of 0.14 mu M and was 2.5 and 80 times more active than isonlazid against MTB and MDR-TB, respectively. Compound 8 was non-toxic to Vero cells up to 183 mu M, with a selectivity index of > 1307. In the in vivo animal model, compound 8 decreased the mycobacterium load in lung and spleen tissues with 2.8 and 3.94 log(10) reductions, respectively.	antimycobacterial activity; antitubercular activity; thiourea derivatives; oxazole derivatives

10.2471_BLT.06.035345	Barriers to reaching the targets for tuberculosis control: multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	The development and expansion of WHO's DOTS strategy was successful, with 83% of the world's population living in countries or parts of countries covered by this strategy by the end of 2004. Treatment success in the 2003 DOTS cohort of 1.7 million patients was 82% on average, close to the 85% target. Treatment success was below average in the African Region (72%), which can be partly attributed to occurrence of HIV co-infection, and in the European Region (75%), partly due to drug resistance. Drug resistance, specifically multidrug resistance and extensive drug resistance, is a serious threat to public health in all countries, especially in the Russian Federation, where the highest rates of multidrug resistance are presently accompanied by a rapid increase in HIV infection. Based on the experience of the first projects approved by the Green Light Committee, the treatment success of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is lower than that of drug-susceptible cases, but nevertheless reaches 70%. The collaborative effort of different organizations, professionals and communities is needed to address the development and spread of multidrug resistance and extensive drug resistance, which combined with the epidemic of HIV infection is one of the barriers to dealing effectively with TB. This effort should be directed towards facilitating the diagnosis and treatment of TB patients, in particular by improving access to drug susceptibility testing and strengthening treatment delivery by rigorous adherence to DOTS as outlined by the Stop TB Partnership.

10.1097_MCP.0b013e3280f3c0b2	The clinical management of drug-resistant tuberculosis	Purpose of review Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a growing problem, with almost half a million cases worldwide. In spite of the difficulty in its management, drug-resistant tuberculosis can be successfully treated, even in poor settings. Recent findings This article will review key findings in the areas of epidemiology, diagnosis and management of drug-resistant tuberculosis, including new antituberculous drugs. The issue of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis will also be reviewed and discussed. Finally, novel approaches to the management of drug-resistant tuberculosis in populations with HIV, as well as in pediatric populations, among pregnant women, and among patients requiring surgical therapy, will be reviewed. Summary New advances in the diagnosis and management of drug-resistant tuberculosis allow for excellent clinical outcomes to be achieved, even in difficult-to-treat populations. This is possible with timely diagnosis of disease and rapid initiation of appropriate therapy in supported settings.	drug resistance; extensive drug-resistant tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; tuberculosis	COMMUNITY-BASED THERAPY; TERM-FOLLOW-UP; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MDR-TB; CHILDREN; PERU; LIMA; PREGNANCY; 1ST-LINE; RIFAMPIN
pub-1773	Trend of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in Korea, 1994-2004	SETTING: The 245 health centres through which the National Tuberculosis Programme (NTP) is implemented in Korea and the TB Laboratory Network of the Korean National Tuberculosis Association. OBJECTIVE: To observe the trend of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in Korea from 1994 to 2004 and possible related factors. DESIGN: All tuberculosis (TB) patients registered for treatment at the health centres for a given period were assessed. RESULTS: Of 2636 new smear-positive patients from the 2004 survey, 338 cases (12.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 11.5-14.1) showed resistance to any of the first-line drugs: 261 with isoniazid (INH) resistance (9.9%, 95% CI 8.8-11.0) and 71 with multidrug resistance (MDR) (2.7%, 95%CI 2.1-3.3). Compared with previous surveys, a statistically significant increase in MDR (P = 0.00675), any drug resistance (P = 0.03779), any INH resistance (P = 0.00313) and any rifampicin resistance (P = 0.00176) has been observed among new cases since 1994. Any resistance to second-line drugs ranged from 0.1% (capreomycin) to 1.1% (para-aminosalicylic acid) among new cases and from 1.1% to 3.6% among retreatment cases. Resistance to kanamycin and ofloxacin was found in 1.4% and 2.6%, respectively, of new and previously treated MDR-TB cases. CONCLUSION: A statistically significant increase in drug resistance was noticed among new cases.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; prevalence	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS
pub-1774	Treatment outcome cohort analysis in an integrated DOTS and DOTS-Plus TB program in Latvia	International guidelines for treatment outcome analysis of tuberculosis cases have been published and are widely used. They do not, however, fully address the incorporation of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases. Here we present an approach to cohort analysis of treatment outcomes for all registered TB cases, including MDR-TB cases. We analyzed all new pulmonary smear- and/or culture-positive cases registered in Latvia during 2002. Analysis of treatment outcomes at 24 months after initial case registration showed overall treatment success at 84%. This approach to outcome analysis is possible only for settings where MDR-TB treatment is established.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; treatment outcomes; cohort analysis	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS
10.1093_jac_dkm054	Genetic and phenotypic characterization of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in Hong Kong	Objectives: To characterize 250 drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates in Hong Kong with respect to their drug susceptibility phenotypes to five common anti-tuberculosis drugs (ofloxacin, rifampicin, ethambutol, isoniazid and pyrazinamide) and the relationship between such phenotypes and the patterns of genetic mutations in the corresponding resistance genes (gyrA, rpoB, embB, katG, inhA, ahpC and pncA). Methods: The MIC values of the aforementioned anti-tuberculosis drugs were determined for each of the 250 drug-resistant MTB clinical isolates by the absolute concentration method. Genetic mutations in the corresponding resistance genes in these MTB isolates were identified by PCR-single-stranded conformation polymorphism/multiplex PCR amplimer conformation analysis (SSCP/MPAC), followed by DNA sequencing of the purified PCR products. Results: Resistance to four or five drugs was commonly observed in these MTB isolates; such phenotypes accounted for over 34% of the 250 isolates. The most frequently observed phenotypes were those involving both rifampicin and isoniazid, with or without additional resistance to the other drugs. A total of 102 novel mutations, which accounted for 80% of all mutation types detected in the 7 resistance genes, were recovered. Correlation between phenotypic and mutational data showed that genetic changes in the gyrA, rpoB and katG genes were more consistently associated with a significant resistance phenotype. Despite this, however, a considerable proportion of resistant MTB isolates were found to harbour no detectable mutations in the corresponding gene loci. Conclusions: These findings expand the spectrum of potential resistance-related mutations in MTB clinical isolates and help consolidate the framework for the development of molecular methods for delineating the drug susceptibility profiles of MTB isolates in clinical laboratories.

10.1136_thx.2005.051961	Surgery for patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis: report of 121 cases receiving community-based treatment in Lima, Peru	Background: While most patients with tuberculosis (TB) can be successfully treated using short-course medical chemotherapy, thoracic surgery is an important adjunctive strategy for many patients with drug-resistant disease. The need for physical, technical and financial resources presents a potential challenge to implementing surgery as a component of treatment for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in resource-poor settings. However, a cohort of patients with severe MDR-TB in Lima, Peru underwent surgery as part of their treatment. Methods: 121 patients underwent pulmonary surgery for drug-resistant tuberculosis between May 1999 and January 2004. Surgery was performed by a team of thoracic surgeons under the Ministry of Health. Patient demographic data, clinical characteristics, surgical procedures and surgical outcomes were studied. Results: Most of the patients had failed multiple TB regimens and were resistant to a median of seven drugs. The median time of follow-up after surgery was 33 months. 79.3% of patients were culture-positive before surgery, and sustained culture-negative status among survivors was achieved in 74.8% of patients. 63% of those followed up for at least 6 months after surgery were either cured or probably cured. Postoperative complications, observed in 22.6% of patients, were associated with preoperative haemoptysis, vital capacity <50% and low forced expiratory volume in 1 s. Conclusions: This is one of the largest cohorts with MDR-TB to be treated with surgery, and the first from a resource-poor country. Although surgery is not often considered an option for patients in resource-poor settings, the findings of this study support the argument that adjunctive surgery should be considered an integral component of MDR-TB treatment programmes, even in poor countries such as Peru.

10.1016_j.ijantimicag.2006.11.023	An intervention programme for the management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in France	As shown in a previous study, the outcome of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in France is not satisfactory (41 % success rate). To improve the management and outcome of patients with MDR-TB, a prospective intervention study was carried out in 1998-1999 by National Reference Centre (NRC) staff. NRC staff contacted (i) the microbiologists reporting MDR-T13 patients in order to offer second-line drug testing and (ii) physicians to help tailor treatment regimens based on World Health Organization guidelines. A total of 45 MDR-TB patients were followed, including 33 for whom NRC staff successfully interacted with the physicians in charge and 12 patients managed without NRC collaboration. The crude proportion of favourable outcomes was 58%, and this proportion reached 70% for patients managed in collaboration with the NRC. Among the latter 33 patients, 32 were treated with at least three active drugs for a median duration of 12 months. In multivariate analysis, HIV-positive status was associated with treatment failure (hazard ratio (HR) 4.3), whereas NRC intervention was associated with a favourable outcome (HR 0.2). However, even in the NRC intervention group the median duration of treatment was shorter than planned (median 12 months) and 12% of patients were lost to follow-up. This intervention study provides encouraging results and should be continued until reference teams and a directly observed treatment strategy (DOTS) are implemented to improve patient management further.

pub-1778	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in a low-incidence region shows a high rate of transmission	OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), a descriptive prospective study was carried out applying a combination of exhaustive conventional epidemiology with molecular genotyping. SETTING: All patients diagnosed with MDR-TB in Galicia, Spain, between 1998 and 2004 were included in the study. DESIGN: Of 9895 diagnosed cases of TB, 58 were MDR-TB (0.59%). The site of disease was pulmonary in 56 cases and 46 were smear-positive. Only two cases were co-infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and seven were immigrants. Twenty-five (43%) had received previous TB treatment. These cases presented more risk factors for treatment default and a lower frequency of contact with cases of MDR-TB. RESULTS: Genotyping analysis was performed in 57 patients, showing evidence of four clusters (30 patients, 52.6%), each with identical genetic patterns. The patients included in the clusters were younger, and most had primary forms or had had contact with another case of MDR-TB, especially in hospital. Neither the Beijing/W nor the B strain was identified. CONCLUSION: There is a low prevalence of MDR-TB in Galicia. Unlike previous studies, there was a high rate of transmissibility, including nosocomial transmission. Transmission is not associated with HIV or previously reported strains with a high capacity for transmission.	epidemiology; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; prevention and control; transmission	SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; NOSOCOMIAL OUTBREAK; DRUG-RESISTANCE; SPAIN; EPIDEMIOLOGY; STRAINS; MARKERS; TRENDS
pub-1779	Genotype and phenotype relationships and transmission analysis of drug-resistant tuberculosis in Singapore	SETTING: The small urban country of Singapore. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationships between Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotypes and drug-resistant phenotypes and to analyse the transmission of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB). DESIGN: A 29-month population-based study comparing drug-resistant and drug-susceptible M. tuberculosis isolates. RESULTS: We found that multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates (n = 41, OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.28-5.50), rifampicin-resistant isolates (n = 48, OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.44-5.76), and streptomycin (SM) resistant isolates (n = 103, OR 3.35, 95% CI 1.99-5.62) were more common among Beijing genotype strains than among non-Beijing strains, while SM-resistant isolates were less common in East-African-Indian (EAI) genotype strains than in non-EAI strains (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.14-0.64). Based on clustering analysis and drug-resistant patterns, 22 of 230 drug-resistant isolates were found to have likely resulted from recent transmission. The estimated transmission rate of DR-TB was 9.6% and that of MDR-TB was 7.7%. The transmission rate of DR-TB was significantly higher among Beijing genotype strains than non-Beijing strains (12.9% vs. 4.4%; P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to other genotypes, Beijing genotype strains are associated with a higher frequency of drug resistance, including multidrug resistance, and are more transmissible. However, the overall transmission rate of DR-TB in Singapore is low.	drug-resistant tuberculosis; molecular epidemiology; Beijing genotype; resistant phenotype	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; BEIJING GENOTYPE; MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; PRISON-INMATES; STRAINS; FAMILY; SPREAD; POLYMORPHISM; NETHERLANDS; CALIFORNIA
pub-1780	Surveillance of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in Ernakulam District, Kerala State, South India	SETTING: This is the first report on drug resistance surveillance (DRS) in Ernakulam District, Kerala, South India, based on a standard protocol from World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. OBJECTIVES: To determine the level of drug resistance among smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients with no history of previous treatment in Ernakulam District, Kerala State. DESIGN: Two additional sputum samples were collected from all consecutive new smear-positive PTB cases registered under the revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) formulated by the Government of India. The generic protocol developed by the Central TB Division for district level DRS in accordance with WHO guidelines was followed. Training of laboratory staff and other health personnel, periodic monitoring and quality assurance of laboratory work were carried out by the Tuberculosis Research Centre, Chennai. RESULTS: A total of 305 (88.7%) sputum samples were positive for culture. Resistance to any drug was seen in 27.9% and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) was observed in 2%. Monoresistance to rifampicin and streptomycin was observed in respectively 1% and 17% of cases, and 27.1% resistance was observed to any drug in the younger age group. CONCLUSION: MDR-TB is within expected ranges in Ernakulam District. Further studies that include the private sector are needed in the state among different age groups.

10.1128_JCM.01949_06	Evaluation of microscopic observation drug susceptibility assay for detection of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Early detection of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is of primary importance for both patient management and infection control. Optimal methods for identifying drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a timely and affordable way in resource-limited settings are not yet available. This study prospectively evaluated a low-technology but rapid drug susceptibility testing method, the microscopic observation drug susceptibility assay (MODS), in the concurrent detection of M. tuberculosis and its susceptibilities to isoniazid and rifampin (two drugs defining multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis) directly from sputum specimens. Sputum samples were collected from 262 smear-positive TB patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. To undertake MODS, 100 mu l of decontaminated samples was inoculated into a 24-well plate containing I ml of 7H9 broth with and without appropriate drugs. The assay uses an inverted-light microscope to detect characteristic mycobacterial growth in liquid culture. Of 262 smear-positive patients, MODS detected 254 (96.9%) and culture in Lowenstein-Jensen medium detected 247 (94.3%) (P = 0.016). For the 247 cultures, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MODS for detecting MDR-TB were 92.0, 99.5, and 98.8%, respectively, using the method of proportion as a reference (concordance, 98.8%; kappa value, 0.932). Results for MODS were obtained in a median time of 9 days. MODS is an optimal alternative method for identifying MDR-TB in a timely and affordable way in resource-limited settings.

10.2146_ajhp050543	Effect of pharmacist-led patient education on adherence to tuberculosis treatment	Purpose. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a clinical pharmacist-directed patient education program on the therapy adherence of first-time tuberculosis (TB) patients and to identify the major pharmaceutical care needs and issues of first-time TB and multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB patients. Methods. In the first part of the study, first-time TB patients were randomized either to the No EDU group (n = 58) where patients received routine medical and nursing care or to the EDU group (n = 56) where patients were also provided with clinical pharmacist-directed patient education. The patient's adherence to treatment was evaluated by attendance at scheduled visits, medication counting, and urine analysis for the presence of isoniazid metabolites. In the second part of the study, the pharmaceutical care needs and issues were determined for first-time TB patients and for MDR-TB patients (n = 40). Results. The adherence of patients who received pharmacist-directed patient education was greater than that of patients who did not. The attendance at scheduled visits and urine analysis for the presence of isoniazid metabolites yielded better results in respect to adherence for the EDU group (p < 0.05), while medication counting did not differ between the two groups. The major pharmaceutical care needs of first-time TB patients were for pain control, nutrient replacement, appropriate prescribing, respiratory control, and diabetic control. Similar findings were recorded for MDR-TB patients. Conclusion. Patients' adherence to TB treatment improved when a pharmacist provided patient education on medication use and addressed patients' pharmaceutical care issues.	antituberculars; clinical pharmacists; compliance; isoniazid; patient information; patients; pharmaceutical care; rational therapy; resistance; tuberculosis	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG; PROSPECTS; THERAPY; SMOKING; PROGRAM; TURKEY; URINE
10.3201_eid1303.061400	Worldwide emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis	Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains that are resistant to an increasing number of second-line drugs used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) are becoming a threat to public health worldwide. We surveyed the Network of Supranational Reference Laboratories for M. tuberculosis isolates that were resistant to second-line anti-TB drugs during 2000-2004. We defined extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB) as MDR TB with further resistance to >= 3 of the 6 classes of second-line drugs. Of 23 eligible laboratories, 14 (61%) contributed data on 17,690 isolates, which reflected drug susceptibility results from 48 countries. Of 3,520 (19.9%) MDR TB isolates, 347 (9.9%) met criteria for XDR TB. Further investigation of population-based trends and expanded efforts to prevent drug resistance and effectively treat patients with MDR TB are crucial for protection of public health and control of TB.

pub-1784	Impact of drug-resistant tuberculosis on the survival of HIV-infected patients	OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) on the survival of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients in an area with a high prevalence of TB. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: Of 225 HIV-TB patients with a mean age of 35.8 years, 72.4% were male. The median CD4 cell count at TB diagnosis was 44 cells/mm(3). Sixty per cent presented with extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB). Sixty-three (28%) patients were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to at least one drug; respectively 16.4%, 9.3%, 5.3% and 12.9% were resistant to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP), ethambutol and streptomycin, and 14 (6.2%) had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). During a median follow-up of 11.5 months, 4% died. From Kaplan-Meier analysis, INH resistance, RMP resistance and MDR-TB were associated with shorter survival (log-rank test, P < 0.005). Cox's proportional hazard model showed that MDR-TB (hazard ratio [HR] 11.7; 95% CI 2.1-64.9), not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) (FIR 7.9; 95%CI 1.5-43.1) and EPTB (HR 5.1; 95%CI 1.925.9) were significant risk factors for death. CONCLUSION: MDR-TB and EPTB substantially reduce survival among patients co-infected with HIV and TB. Early detection and optimal treatment of MDR-TB are crucial. ART significantly prolongs survival and should be initiated in HIV-TB co-infected patients.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; survival; HIV; AIDS	HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; MORBIDITY; MORTALITY; THAILAND; INITIATION; EPIDEMIC; DISEASE
10.1111_j.1469_0691.2006.01583.x	Molecular epidemiology and prevalence of mutations conferring rifampicin and isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains from the southern Ukraine	Understanding the molecular epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) and mutations in genes associated with drug resistance may contribute to the development of appropriate interventions to improve tuberculosis control. A structured questionnaire was used to collect basic epidemiological data from 589 patients with radiologically confirmed TB in the Odessa and Nikolaev regions of the Ukraine in 2003-2004. A non-commercial reverse hybridisation assay and DNA sequencing were used to detect mutations associated with rifampicin and isoniazid resistance. Genotyping was performed using multilocus variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) typing and spoligotyping. Mutations conferring rifampicin and isoniazid resistance were detected in 32.9% and 44.0%, respectively, of 225 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from individual consecutive patients. Mutations in codon 531 and codon 315 of the rpoB and katG genes, respectively, were predominant among drug-resistant isolates. Multidrug (MDR) resistance rates were significantly higher among former prison inmates compared with non-prisoners (54.8% vs. 27.3%; RR 2.01; 95% CI 1.35-2.97) and the prevalence of mutations was higher in Beijing strains sharing the VNTR signature 223325173533424 than in other Beijing strains (71.4% vs. 45.7%; RR 1.74; 95% CI 1.17-2.57), suggesting that this group may be responsible for rapid transmission of MDR TB in the southern Ukraine.	molecular typing; mutations; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; resistance; typing; Ukraine	DRUG-RESISTANCE; BEIJING FAMILY; GENETIC DIVERSITY; RUSSIA; DIFFERENTIATION; EVOLUTIONARY; POPULATION; GENOTYPES; NUMBER; HIV
10.1017_S0950268806006790	Instability of IS6110 patterns in multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis	The stability of IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) pattern was determined in 31 isolates from patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). These patients were in actual chains of transmission and they referred to the National Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, Tehran, Iran. Susceptibility testing against first- and second-line drugs were performed by the proportional method on Lowenstein-Jensen culture media. Thereafter, DNA fingerprinting by IS6110 with direct repeat (DR) region as a probe was performed by standard protocols. The rate of IS6110 changes was 16%, although, no variation was found in the DR region, in a time-span of 1-63 months. The strains with unstable IS6110 patterns were resistant to all drugs tested, and the majority of them (60%) were collected from HIV-positive patients. The results demonstrated that for a reliable interpretation of strain typing, it is better to use an additional marker along with IS6110 RFLP.

pub-1787	Results of a national survey on drug resistance among pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Rwanda	BACKGROUND: One of the principal objectives of tuberculosis (TB) control is to minimise the emergence of drug resistance. The first national survey was conducted in Rwanda to determine the prevalence of M. tuberculosis drug resistance. METHODS: Sputum samples were collected from all new and retreatment cases in the health districts from November 2004 to February 2005. Drug susceptibility testing of isolates against first-line drugs was performed by the proportion method. RESULTS: Of 616 strains from new cases, 6.2% were resistant to isoniazid, 3.9% to rifampicin and 3.9% were multidrug-resistant TB. Among 85 strains from previously treated cases, the prevalence of resistance was respectively 10.6%, 10.6% and 9.4% (MDR-TB strains). Eight MDR cases showed additional resistance to ethambutol and streptomycin. CONCLUSION: The level of MDR-TB among TB patients in Rwanda is high. The main reasons of this emergence of MDR-TB can be attributed to the disorganisation of the health system, migration of the population during the 1994 civil war and poor success rates, with a high number of patients transferred out and lost to follow-up. On the other hand, the use of treatment regimens administered twice weekly during the continuation phase could be another important factor and merit further investigations.	national survey; primary resistance; acquired resistance; tuberculosis; Rwanda	HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; NEVIRAPINE; RIFAMPICIN; AFRICA
pub-1788	The old battle between the human species and Koch's bacillae. Can one dream of eradicating tuberculosis?	This article analyses the complexity of the age-old battle that the human species has been waging for millions of years against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We review all of the knowledge available about this disease, and the most important future developments, in order to reach the conclusion that it is indeed possible to dream of eradicating this disease that has caused such harm to humanity. In spite of the human species possessing sufficient knowledge to win the battle against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, important conditioning factors, above all social in character (poverty, immigration, HIV, MDR), are favouring the bacteria in this war. And, in spite of suitably applying all of the positive knowledge acquired for the control of TB (detection and cure of cases, chemoprofilaxis, BCG vaccination, etc.), it will still take several centuries to achieve its eradication. Only by discovering a vaccine that is 100% efficient, or the discovery of new anti-microbial associations that could cure the disease in no longer than 15 days, could accelerate this advance towards its eradication. But, unfortunately, there are no reasons allowing us to dream that either of these two possibilities can be fulfilled in the next 10 to 20 years. Therefore, the dream of eradicating TB is a very old dream, but one that unfortunately remains very distant.	tuberculosis; eradication; immune system; vaccine; MDR-TB	COMPLETE GENOME SEQUENCE; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; EXOGENOUS REINFECTION; PUBLISHED LITERATURE; MURINE TUBERCULOSIS; GRAN-CANARIA; BCG; METAANALYSIS; VACCINE; PREVENTION
pub-1789	Guidance for National Tuberculosis Programmes on the management of tuberculosis in children - Chapter 4: Childhood contact screening and management	Young children living in close contact with a case of smear-positive pulmonary TB (PTB) are at particular risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and TB disease. Screening of the household contacts of an infectious source case is therefore recommended to identify children with TB and enable their prompt treatment, and to provide children who do not have TB with isoniazid preventive treatment. Isoniazid preventive treatment (IPT) is particularly beneficial in the case of children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A breastfeeding infant has a particularly high risk of infection from a mother with smear-positive pulmonary TB, and a high risk of developing TB. The infant should receive 6 months of IPT, followed by BCG vaccination. Breastfeeding can be safely continued in children during this period. The organisation of a system for comprehensive child contact screening depends on collaboration between the National TB Programme (NTP) and all child health providers. Close contacts of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB patients should receive careful clinical follow-up for at least 2 years. If active disease develops, prompt initiation of treatment with a regimen designed to treat MDR-TB is recommended. On the basis of the currently available evidence, the World Health Organization does not recommend second-line drugs for chemoprophylaxis in MDR-TB contacts.	child; TB; contact; screening; management	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; HOUSEHOLD; ADULTS; TRANSMISSION; INFECTION; RESISTANT; MALAWI
10.1016_j.bmc.2006.09.020	Synthesis and antitubercular activity of substituted phenylmethyl- and pyridylmethyl amines	A total of 42 benzyl- and pyridylmethyl amines were synthesized either by reductive amination of aromatic/heteroaromatic aldehydes with amines or by conjugate addition of amines to the cinnamates followed by reduction of the ester group with lithium aluminium, hydride to the respective propanolamines. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated against both avirulent and virulent strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Many of the compounds exhibited MIC as low as 1.56 mu g/mL. Few of potent compounds were also evaluated against clinical isolates of MDR TB and found to be active at one or other concentrations with MIC as low as 3.12 mu g/mL. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

pub-1791	An outbreak of drug-resistant tuberculosis caused by a Beijing strain in the Western Cape, South Africa	During October 2005, four children in a school in Cape Town were identified with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Genetic analysis confirmed that these isolates belonged to a single cluster (Beijing cluster 220) and that all harboured a - 15 inhA(C-T) promoter mutation demonstrating transmission. Genetic analysis of isolates cultured from patients from the Boland-Overberg-South Cape-Karoo and Cape Town regions showed that 28% (58/209) of patients infected with a Beijing strain had the cluster 220 genotypes and that all harboured the same - 15 inhA(C-T) promoter mutation. The presence of these transmissible MDR-TB strains may pose a threat to the community, and rigorous infection control measures are needed to ensure the safety of those exposed.	drug resistance; outbreak; genotyping; transmission	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS
10.1111_j.1466_7657.2006.00490.x	Nurses as providers of emotional support to patients with MDR-TB	Aim: To identify the forms and means of emotional support that nurses provide to patients living with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MTR-TB) in Lima, Peru. Background: A fundamental role of nurses is to provide emotional support, defined as all the strategies that a health team employs to assure the psychosocial well-being of the patient. However, neither the forms of emotional support nor the means used by nurses in resource-poor settings have been much written about. This paper describes a qualitative study of a team of seven nurses working in a programme that provides individualized MDR-TB treatment to patients in Lima, Peru. It describes the various forms of support that facilitated the ability of patients to adhere to treatment despite socio-economic difficulties, social stigma, drug side effects, problems related to different stages of treatment and concurrent illnesses/special situations. Methods: Qualitative study methods were employed over the course of 8 years to observe nurses and patients in an MDR-TB treatment programme. These included participant observation, structured observation sessions of nurses with their patients and focus groups with seven nurses. Conclusion: Through theme and content analyses of qualitative data, ten situations related to MDR-TB treatment were found. These ten issues served as an analytical framework used to identify and discuss the various types of emotional support provided by both formal and informal means. This type of support focused on problems related to different stages of treatment, social stigma of the illness, treatment adherence, side effects, socio-economic difficulties, death and concurrent illnesses/special situations. Practical implications: The essential role of the nurse as a provider of emotional support in the development or implementation of similar programmes with MDR-TB should, in future, be taken into account.	adherence; community nursing; emotional support; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; resource poor; socio-economic	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; CARE; THERAPY; HEALTH
10.1128_AAC.00766_06	Combinations of R207910 with drugs used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis have the potential to shorten treatment duration	The objective of the present study was to identify the optimal R207910-containing regimen to administer to patients who cannot receive rifampin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) because of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), concomitant use of antiretroviral drugs, or toxicity. Mice were infected intravenously with 5 x 106 CFU of the H37Rv strain and treated five times per week with 8207910 alone or various combinations of 8207910 with the second-line drugs amikacin (AMK), pyrazinamide (PZA), moxifloxacin (MXF), and ethionamide (ETH). All R207910-containing regimens were significantly more active than the non-R207910-containing regimens after 1 month of therapy. When given for 2 months, 8207910 alone was more active than the WHO standard first-line regimen RIF-INH-PZA. When 8207910 was combined with second-line drugs, the combinations were more active than the currently recommended regimen of MDR-TB AMK-ETH-MXF-PZA, and culture negativity of both the lungs and spleen was reached after 2 months of treatment in almost every case.

10.1183_09031936.06.00125705	Outcome of pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a 6-yr follow-up study	A retrospective study was performed to determine factors associated with the outcome of pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Taipei, Taiwan. All patients newly diagnosed with pulmonary MDR-TB in a referral centre from 1992-1996 were enrolled and their outcome over the subsequent 6 yrs was determined. A total of 299 patients were identified, comprising 215 (71.9%) males and 84 (28.1%) females with a mean age of 47.3 yrs. The patients received a mean of 3.7 effective drugs. Out of the 299 patients, 153 (51.2%) were cured, 31 (10.4%) failed, 28 (9.4%) died and 87 (29.1%) defaulted. Of the 125 patients receiving second-line drugs with ofloxacin, 74 (59.2%) were cured. Those who received ofloxacin had a lower risk of relapse than those receiving only first-line drugs (hazard ratio (HR) 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03-0.81) and a lower risk of TB-related death than those receiving second-line drugs but not ofloxacin (adjusted HR 0.509 95% Cl 0.31-0.82). In conclusion, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients who received ofloxacin were more likely to be cured, and were less likely to die, fail or relapse. The utility of new-generation fluoroquinolones, such as moxifloxacin, in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis needs to be evaluated. Default from treatment is a major challenge in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.	death; follow-up; multidrug resistant; relapse; tuberculosis	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MURINE TUBERCULOSIS; CONTAINING REGIMENS; MOXIFLOXACIN; FLUOROQUINOLONES; OFLOXACIN; TAIWAN; CHEMOTHERAPY; RESECTION; RIFAMPIN
10.1016_j.meegid.2006.03.001	rpoB gene sequencing and spoligotyping of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from India	Multi drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR TB) has been well studied in outbreaks in settings of low endemicity in developed countries. However, the characteristics of MDR TB in the community with high endemicity such as India have not been well investigated. Mutations in the 81-bp rifampicin resistance-determining region of the rpoB gene were analyzed by DNA sequencing of 187 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates (149 resistant and 38 sensitive) from different parts of India. 146-Point mutations and two insertions were found in 146 of 149 resistant isolates in seven codons. The most common mutations were in codons 531 (59%), 526 (22%), and 516 (11.5%). Mutations were not found in three (2%) of the resistant isolates. N-terminal sequencing in these isolates showed no mutation at codon V176. None of the drug-susceptible isolates showed any mutation in the 437-bp rpoB gene segment sequenced. Genotypic analysis revealed a total of 80 different spoligotypes. A unique pattern was found in 65 (43.6%) isolates, whereas 84 (56.4%) were in 15 clusters. Comparison with an international spoligotype database showed ST26, Delhi type (18.1%), ST1, Beijing type (9.4%), and ST11 (5.4%), as the most common. The majority of isolates in the Beijing genotype (13/14) were associated with mutation 53 ITTG and similar drug-resistance patterns while other major clusters showed that the nature and frequency of occurrence of mutations in the rpoB gene were independent of spoligopatterns.

pub-1796	Early and rapid microscopy-based diagnosis of true treatment failure and MDR-TB	SETTING: Damien Foundation tuberculosis (TB) control project in Bangladesh. OBJECTIVE: Early diagnosis of true TB treatment failure and multidrug resistance (MDR) for more efficient DOTS-Plus. DESIGN: Prospective comparison of performance on smear-positive sputum of fluorescein diacetate (FDA) vital staining vs. culture, and of slide drug susceptibility testing (slide DST) vs. the Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) proportion method. RESULTS: FDA reached 92% positive and 97% negative predictive value directly on fresh sputum, but only 94% and 62%, respectively, on transported smears. Accuracy on washed cetylpyridinium chloride transported sputum was similar to that on fresh sputum. Slide DST on fresh smear-positive sputum failed less often than LJ DST, with 96% accurate results for rifampicin and MDR-TB diagnosis. Good results were obtained for isoniazid (90% accuracy), but not for ethambutol or streptomycin. CONCLUSIONS: We can confirm that FDA staining allows rapid screening for viable acid-fast bacilli and true treatment failure in delayed smear converters or smear-defined failures, while slide DST assures fast and accurate confirmation of MDR-TB in selected populations. The tests can be applied safely in resource-poor settings. Their successive use could be an efficient strategy for screening and an early start on standardised regimens of DOTS-Plus candidates.	microscopy; Ziehl-Neelsen; vital staining; slide culture	ACID-FAST BACILLI; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG SUSCEPTIBILITY ASSAY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; SPUTUM SAMPLES; FLUORESCEIN DIACETATE; CHLORIDE SOLUTION; ETHIDIUM-BROMIDE; SMEARS
10.1016_j.jinf.2005.12.020	Prevalence of Haarlem I and Beijing types of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in Iranian and Afghan MDR-TB patients	Objectives: This survey identified the spoligopatterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains with an international designation responsible for transmission and prevalence of Multi-Drug Resistance Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) among native and immigrant population of Tehran (2000-2005). Methods: The spacer oligonucleotides typing was performed on 263 M. tuberculosis strains isolated from verified cases of MDR-TB. Clinical and demographical data of patients were collected using traditional methods. Results: Classical epidemiological investigation revealed that out of 263 MDR-TB cases, 175, 66.5% were isolated from Afghan immigrants. In both communities, majority of MDR-TB cases had either previous history of TB (107, 40.6%) or had a close contact (84, 31.9%). By spoligotyping, 27 distinct patterns were observed, 253 clinical isolates were grouped in 17 clusters (62.9%) and 10 isolates displayed an orphan pattern (37%). Based on an international spoligotype database, Haarlem 1 (85, 33.5%), Beijing (52, 20.5%), Central Asia (32, 12.1%), and EAI (21, 8.3%) were the major identified super families. Although, 76.9% of the Beijing genotypes and 100% of ST253 strains (that was prevalent through former Soviet Union) were isolated from Afghan patients only. The linkage patterns between 30 Iranian and Afghan patients were observed. Conclusion: The study highlighted the epidemic potential of Haarlem I and Beijing genotypes among MDR-TB cases in Tehran territory. (C) 2005 The British Infection Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

10.1371_journal.pmed.0030466	OPC-67683, a nitro-dihydro-imidazooxazole derivative with promising action against tuberculosis in vitro and in mice	Background Tuberculosis (TB) is still a leading cause of death worldwide. Almost a third of the world's population is infected with TB bacilli, and each year approximately 8 million people develop active TB and 2 million die as a result. Today's TB treatment, which dates back to the 1970s, is long and burdensome, requiring at least 6 mo of multidrug chemotherapy. The situation is further compounded by the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and by the infection's lethal synergy with HIV/AIDS. Global health and philanthropic organizations are now pleading for new drug interventions that can address these unmet needs in TB treatment. Methods and Findings Here we report OPC-67683, a nitro-dihydro-imidazooxazole derivative that was screened to help combat the unmet needs in TB treatment. The compound is a mycolic acid biosynthesis inhibitor found to be free of mutagenicity and to possess highly potent activity against TB, including MDR-TB, as shown by its exceptionally low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 0.006-0.024 mu g/ml in vitro and highly effective therapeutic activity at low doses in vivo. Additionally, the results of the post-antibiotic effect of OPC-67683 on intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis showed the agent to be highly and dose- dependently active also against intracellular M. tuberculosis H37Rv after a 4-h pulsed exposure, and this activity at a concentration of 0.1 mu g/ml was similar to that of the first-line drug rifampicin (RFP) at a concentration of 3 mu g/ml. The combination of OPC-67683 with RFP and pyrazinamide (PZA) exhibited a remarkably quicker eradication (by at least 2 mo) of viable TB bacilli in the lung in comparison with the standard regimen consisting of RFP, isoniazid (INH), ethambutol (EB), and PZA. Furthermore, OPC-67683 was not affected by nor did it affect the activity of liver microsome enzymes, suggesting the possibility for OPC-67683 to be used in combination with drugs, including anti-retrovirals, that induce or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Conclusions We concluded that based on these properties OPC-67683 has the potential to be used as a TB drug to help combat the unmet needs in TB treatment.

10.1111_j.1400_1843.2006.00948.x	Cost of treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in South Korea	Objective and background: Costs associated with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are higher than those associated with drug-susceptible TB because of the higher prices of second-line anti-TB drugs, the prolonged duration of treatment, greater productivity loss and higher mortality. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost of treatment for MDR-TB according to the treatment strategy and prognosis in South Korea. Methods: We estimated the direct (medical and non-medical) and indirect cost for the treatment of MDR-TB according to the treatment strategies and prognosis: in medically treated, surgically treated and deceased patients groups. The same analyses were undertaken for drug-susceptible TB for comparison. The patients with MDR-TB or drug-susceptible TB were randomly selected from the TB cohort of Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea. Results: Direct costs per person were US$4000 (US$2527-4841) in the medically treated group, US$17 457 (US$10 133-26 418) in the surgically treated group and US$33 362 (US$25 386-40 338) in the deceased group. Total costs per person were US$15 856 (US$10 752-38 421), US$47 159 (US$20 587-77 622) and US$478 357 (US$257 377-777 778), respectively. For the patients with drug-susceptible TB, the total cost ranged from US$1680 to US$7637 (median US$2166). Conclusions: The cost for the treatment of MDR-TB is seven to 22 times that of managing the drug-susceptible TB in South Korea. Considering the high cost, transmissibility and considerable fatality of MDR-TB, there is a need to provide specific separate funding for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.	cost; multidrug-resistant; tuberculosis	PULMONARY RESECTION; CHEMOTHERAPY; COUNTRIES; HEALTH; IMPACT
10.1016_j.diagmicrobio.2006.03.015	Rapid detection of rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis by in-house, reverse line blot assay	Drug resistance in tuberculosis is a significant problem in countries endemic for tuberculosis. A sensitive, specific, and high-throughput reverse line blot assay (RLBA) for the detection of genotypic resistance to rifampicin (RIF) was designed and evaluated. DNA sequencing done for 72 resistant isolates from Delhi, for baseline data, showed mutations within the rpoB core region in all RIF-resistant strains. The RLBA includes oligonucleotide probes specific for wild-type and mutant sequences, allowing sensitive detection of both genotypes in a single assay. The assay based on reverse hybridization principle simultaneously detects 13 different mutations affecting 6 independent codons, including the most prevalent mutations at positions 531 and 526. Application of the method to a panel of 292 MDR TB isolates and susceptible strains from 5 different cities in India showed 98% concordance with the sequencing results. This rapid, simple, economical, and highly sensitive assay provides a practical alternative to sequencing for genotypic evaluation of RIF resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

pub-1801	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: An update on the best regimens	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is defined as tuberculosis caused by strains that have documented in vitro resistance to isoniazid and rifampin. Treatment involves a regimen consisting of at least 4 or 5 drugs to which the infecting strain has documented susceptibility. These agents may include ethambutol, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, a fluoroquinolone, ethionamide, prothionamide, cycloserine, and para-amino salicylic acid. In addition, an injectable agent, such as kanamycin, amikacin, or capreomycin, should be used until negative sputum cultures have been documented for at least 6 months. If the patient has severe parenchymal damage, high-grade resistance, or clinically advanced disease, also. consider clofazimine, amoxicillin/clavulanate, or clarithromycin, although there is little evidence supporting their efficacy in this setting. Routine monitoring includes monthly sputum smear and culture testing, monthly assessment of renal function and electrolyte levels, and liver function tests every 3 to 6 months.	tuberculosis; drug resistance	COMMUNITY-BASED THERAPY; MDR-TB; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MANAGEMENT; LIMA; PERU
pub-1802	National anti-tuberculosis drug resistance survey, 2002, in Myanmar	SETTING: Thirty townships of Myanmar. OBJECTIVES: To determine the proportions of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in new and previously treated pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) cases in Myanmar. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. Drug susceptibility was tested by the proportion method at the National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory, Yangon. RESULTS: Of 874 TB patients included from 30 sites, 849 isolates obtained from individual patients (733 from new cases and 116 from previously treated cases) were tested for susceptibility to four primary anti-tuberculosis drugs. Of 733 isolates tested from new TB patients, 10% were resistant to any one of the anti-tuberculosis drugs, 6.5% to isoniazid (INH), 4.6% to rifampicin (RMP) and 4.0% were multidrug-resistant (MDR). Of the 116 previously treated patients, 30.2% were resistant to any one of the drugs, 26.7% to INH, 15.5% to RMP and 15.5% were MDR. Previous anti-tuberculosis treatment of more than 1 month was strongly associated with the development of MDR-TB (adjusted OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.5-9.1). CONCLUSION: The first national drug resistance survey in Myanmar revealed 4 % and 15.5 % MDR-TB among new and retreatment cases, respectively. Previous antituberculosis treatment was an important risk factor for MDR-TB. Continuous monitoring of drug resistance trends is needed.	national drug resistance survey; MDR-TB; tuberculosis; Myanmar	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; INDIA; SURVEILLANCE
10.1093_jac_dkl332	Selective intracellular accumulation of the major metabolite issued from the activation of the prodrug ethionamide in mycobacteria	Background: Ethionamide is one of the most widely used drugs for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Like isoniazid, and pyrazinamide, ethionamide is a prodrug that needs to be activated by a mycobacterial enzyme. Activation pathways of prodrugs are generally problematic to uncover as they produce intermediates potentially difficult to characterize, to purify and that might prove unstable outside of their cellular context. Objectives and methods: We have used high resolution magic angle spinning-NMR (HRMAS-NMR) to follow ethionamide activation directly within living mycobacterial cells. Results: Data indicated that the intracellular metabolization of ethionamide strictly depends on the presence of the monooxygenase EthA and that EthA-dependent activation of ethionamide is coupled to a precise molecular sorting mechanism of the ethionamide metabolites. We found that the previously identified ethionamide metabolite 2-ethyl-4-hydroxymethylpyridine is produced in substantial amounts by the ethionamide-treated mycobacteria and that it is present exclusively outside of the bacteria. In contrast, the still unidentified ethionamide metabolite ETH* is the only ethionamide derivative detected within the bacterial cell. Moreover, ETH* appears to be unable to cross the bacterial envelope and consequently accumulates within the cytoplasm of the ethionamide-treated mycobacteria. Conclusions: These results strongly suggest that ETH* is the active antimycobacterial ethionamide derivative and open new perspectives for the understanding of the mode of action of prodrugs.

10.1371_journal.pmed.0030384	Tuberculosis recurrence and mortality after successful treatment: Impact of drug resistance	"Background The DOTS (directly observed treatment short-course) strategy for tuberculosis ( TB) control is recommended by the World Health Organization globally. However, there are few studies of long-term TB treatment outcomes from DOTS programs in high-burden settings and particularly settings of high drug resistance. A DOTS program was implemented progressively in Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan starting in 1998. The total case notification rate in 2003 was 462/100,000, and a drug resistance survey found multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains among 13% of new and 40% of previously treated patients. A retrospective, observational study was conducted to assess the capacity of standardized short-course chemotherapy to effectively cure patients with TB in this setting. Methods and Findings Using routine data sources, 213 patients who were sputum smear-positive for TB, included in the drug resistance survey and diagnosed consecutively in 2001-2002 from four districts, were followed up to a median of 22 months from diagnosis, to determine mortality and subsequent TB rediagnosis. Valid follow-up data were obtained for 197 (92%) of these patients. Mortality was high, with an average of 15% (95% confidence interval, 11% to 19%) dying per year after diagnosis (6% of 73 pansusceptible cases and 43% of 55 MDR TB cases also died per year). While 73 (74%) of the 99 new cases were ""successfully"" treated, 25 (34%) of these patients were subsequently rediagnosed with recurrent TB (13 were smear-positive on rediagnosis). Recurrence ranged from ten (23%) of 43 new, pansusceptible cases to six (60%) of ten previously treated MDR TB cases. MDR M. tuberculosis infection and previous TB treatment predicted unsuccessful DOTS treatment, while initial drug resistance contributed substantially to both mortality and disease recurrence after successful DOTS treatment. Conclusions These results suggest that specific treatment of drug-resistant TB is needed in similar settings of high drug resistance. High disease recurrence after successful treatment, even for drug-susceptible cases, suggests that at least in this setting, end-of-treatment outcomes may not reflect the longer-term status of patients, with consequent negative impacts for patients and for TB control."

10.1183_09031936.06.00023006	Prognostic factors for surgical resection in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Although surgical lung resection could improve prognosis in some patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), there are no reports on the optimal candidates for this surgery. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the prognostic factors for surgery in patients with MDR-TB. Patients who underwent lung resection for the treatment of MDR-TB between March 1993 and December 2004 were included in the present study. Treatment failure was defined as greater than or equal to two of the five cultures recorded in the final 12 months of treatment being positive, any one of the final three cultures being positive, or the patient having died during treatment. The variables that affected treatment outcomes were identified through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. In total, 79 patients with MDR-TB were included in the present study. The treatment outcomes of 22 (27.8%) patients were classified as failure. A body mass index < 18.5 kg(.)m(-2), primary resistance, resistance to ofloxacin and the presence of a cavitary lesion beyond the range of the surgical resection were associated with treatment failure. Low body mass index, primary resistance, resistance to ofloxacin and cavitary lesions beyond the range of resection are possible poor prognostic factors for surgical lung resection in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients.	multidrug-resistant; prognosis; surgery; tuberculosis	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; SURGERY; COMMUNITY; THERAPY
pub-1806	In the European Union, TB patients from former Soviet countries have a high risk of multidrug resistance	SETTING: Fourteen countries of the European Union (EU). OBJECTIVE: To explore determinants of resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin (multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [MDR-TB]) among tuberculosis (TB) patients in the EU. DESIGN: Pooled TB case notification data for 2003 from the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) and Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden and the UK were investigated using bivariate and multivariable analysis. RESULTS: Of 12109 cases with data, MDR-TB occurred in 709 cases, 91% of whom were from countries of the former Soviet Union (FSU), including the Baltic States. At multivariable analysis, MDR-TB was strongly associated with previous treatment in both Baltic and non-Baltic countries (adjusted OR 9.5 and 6.4, respectively), and inversely related to age >64 years (OR 0.4 and 0.2). In non-Baltic countries, MDR-TB was more strongly related to origin from the FSU (OR 19.7, reference non-Baltic EU) than from other regions (up to OR 2.3). Among cases pooled from all countries, provenance from the FSU was very strongly linked to MDR-TB in both previously untreated (OR 24.9) and previously treated (OR 53.7) cases. CONCLUSION: Within a context of increasing mobility, public health workers should be aware of a higher risk for MDR-TB among patients from the FSU as well as among patients previously treated for TB.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; European Union; former Soviet Union; multivariable analysis	TUBERCULOSIS; DISEASE; SYSTEM
10.1093_jac_dkl298	Efficacy and tolerability of daily-half dose linezolid in patients with intractable multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Objectives: Although linezolid has good in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, its long-term use in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) may be limited by its cost and serious adverse reactions. We therefore evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of a reduced dose of linezolid, in combination with other anti-TB drugs, in patients with intractable or extensive MDR-TB. Methods: MDR-TB patients unresponsive to at least three cycles of treatment were treated with daily-half doses of linezolid (600 mg once per day) plus at least four companion drugs. Results: As of March 2006, eight patients, all HIV-negative, had been treated with linezolid for 3-18 months. Cultures became negative in all patients in an average of 82 days. Four patients developed peripheral neuropathy, two developed optic neuropathy and one developed anaemia. Although optic neuropathy resolved after cessation of linezolid therapy, peripheral neuropathy continued. One patient completed 18 months of linezolid therapy. Two patients, who have taken linezolid for 15-17 months, are still on treatment and remain in culture conversion. Three patients stopped linezolid after 7-9 months, two because of side effects and one for economic reasons, but remain on treatment with other second-line drugs with culture conversion. Two patients died from severe respiratory failure, but both previously had shown culture conversion. Conclusions: Although daily-half doses of linezolid were effective in patients with intractable or extensive MDR-TB, this dosage regimen did not reduce long-term use-related side effects, such as peripheral and optic neuropathy.	oxazolidinones; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; treatment failure; adverse effects	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; SAFETY
10.1111_j.1745_4581.2006.00049.x	DNA sequence analysis of rpoB gene mutations in rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is an increasing health problem, which contributes to mortality from tuberculosis (TB). Rifampicin (RIF) resistance is considered a marker for MDR-TB. Resistance to RIF results from mutation in the gene encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoB) of the mycobacterial tuberculosis (MTB) complex. The aim of this study was to assess the presence of RIF-resistant TB strains using the BACTEC 460 TB system (Becton Dickinson Microbiology System, Cockeysville, MD) and to determine the pattern of rpoB gene mutations in those strains by title probe assay in combination with DNA sequence analysis. The study was carried out on 60 patients with pulmonary TB. Sputum samples were cultured in the BA CTEC 460 system. Positive TB cultures were subjected to antimycobacterial susceptibility by BACTEC 460 and agar proportional susceptibility test. RIF-resistant strains were further evaluated by line probe assay for the presence of rpoB mutations and DNA sequence analysis for detection of type of mutation. All sputum samples yielded growth by both conventional and BACTEC 460 system. Of the isolated TB bacilli, 20.0, 20.7, 6.7 and 3.3% were resistant to RIF, isoniazid (INH), ethambutol and streptomycin, respectively. Twenty percent were MDR-TB. The line probe assay had 100% sensitivity and 95.8% specificity The most common mutations detected by DNA sequencer were detected within the 69-bp hypervariable region of the rpoB gene, mostly His 5267Tyr and Ser531 Leu mutations. From this study, we could conclude that the most frequent drug resistance of TB was for RIF and INH. The most frequent sequence mutations were detected within the 69-bp hypervariable region of the rpoB gene as His5267yr and Ser531 Leu mutations. The line probe assay was a simple, reliable and rapid screening tool for early detection and characterization of RIF-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains.

10.1371_journal.pmed.0030352	Feasibility and cost-effectiveness of treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: A cohort study in the Philippines	Background Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is an important global health problem, and a control strategy known as DOTS-Plus has existed since 1999. However, evidence regarding the feasibility, effectiveness, cost, and cost-effectiveness of DOTS-Plus is still limited. Methodology/Principal Findings We evaluated the feasibility, effectiveness, cost, and cost-effectiveness of a DOTS-Plus pilot project established at Makati Medical Center in Manila, the Philippines, in 1999. Patients with MDR-TB are treated with regimens, including first- and second-line drugs, tailored to their drug susceptibility pattern (i.e., individualised treatment). We considered the cohort enrolled between April 1999 and March 2002. During this three-year period, 118 patients were enrolled in the project; 117 were considered in the analysis. Seventy-one patients (61%) were cured, 12 (10%) failed treatment, 18 (15%) died, and 16 (14%) defaulted. The average cost per patient treated was US$3,355 from the perspective of the health system, of which US$1,557 was for drugs, and US$837 from the perspective of patients. The mean cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) gained by the DOTS-Plus project was US$242 ( range US$85 to US$426). Conclusions Treatment of patients with MDR-TB using the DOTS-Plus strategy and individualised drug regimens can be feasible, comparatively effective, and cost-effective in low- and middle-income countries.

10.1016_j.rmed.2006.01.002	Long-term moxifloxacin in complicated tuberculosis patients with adverse reactions or resistance to first line drugs	Study objectives: To test safety and tolerability of long-term moxifloxacin in resistant tuberculosis (TB) patients and patients with intolerance to first line anti-TB drugs. Design: Clinical evaluation of adverse events (AEs) during prolonged moxifloxacin treatment. Setting: TB Unit of the Regional TB Reference Center, Villa Marelli Institute, Niguarda Ca'Granda Hospital, Milan, Italy Patients and interventions: Patients treated with moxifloxacin, 400 mg orally once daily for TB in the Villa Marelli Institute from January 2001 to December 2003 were enrolled. Results: Thirty-eight patients were treated with moxifloxacin at the Villa Marelli Institute in the study period, for multidrug resistant (MDR) TB (14, 36.8%), for intolerance to first line anti-TB drugs (9, 23.7%), for combined resistance and intolerance to first tine anti-TB drugs (12, 31.6%), other reasons (3, 7.9%). The mean duration of moxifloxacin treatment was 6.3 +/- 5.2 months. Twelve (31.6%) patients reported at least an AE due to moxifloxacin, mostly gastrointestinal (8, 21.0%), general (5, 13.2%) and central nervous system (3, 7.9%) AEs. In 4 (10.5%) patients the drug was withdrawn for major AEs; no irreversible or fatal events were recorded. Most of the patients (31, 81.6%) reported a treatment success, even if the success rate was lower in MDR TB patients (8/14, 51.7%). Conclusions: Despite the fact that a large proportion of patients experienced at least an AE due to moxifloxacin, the drug resulted safe in the long-term administration for complicated TB cases.

10.1086_505877	Global incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Background. The global number of incident cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) in 2000 was estimated to be 272,906 (95% confidence interval [CI], 184,948-414,295). For accurate planning of TB control programs, this estimate and others have been revised using data from additional countries and by including in the model previously treated TB cases, which had not been accounted for in the previous analysis. Methods. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify variables that were predictive of MDR-TB frequency among new and previously treated cases surveyed in 90 and 77 countries, respectively. These variables were then used to estimate MDR-TB frequencies in countries that had not been surveyed. Results. The total number of MDR-TB cases estimated to have occurred worldwide in 2004 is 424,203 (95% CI, 376,019-620,061), or 4.3% (95% CI, 3.8%-6.1%) of all new and previously treated TB cases. In the same year, 181,408 (95% CI, 135,276-319,017) MDR-TB cases were estimated to have occurred among previously treated TB cases alone. Three countries-China, India, and the Russian Federation-accounted for 261,362 (95% CI, 180,779-414,749) MDR-TB cases, or 62% of the estimated global burden. Conclusions. These updated sets of estimates incorporating previously treated TB cases call for an urgent plan to expand appropriate diagnostic and treatment services for patients with MDR-TB in low-resource settings.

pub-1812	Timely diagnosis of MDR-TB under program conditions: is rapid drug susceptibility testing sufficient?	Timely diagnosis and effective, safe treatment are essential to reduce transmission and improve outcomes for patients with tuberculosis. Aside from laboratory methods, many programmatic factors influence the overall turnaround time (TAT) in diagnosing multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). We measured each step in the overall TAT required for MDR-TB in two of five health districts of Lima, Peru. The total TAT, from initial sputurn specimen to diagnosis and appropriate treatment, was 5 months, almost twice as long as the bacteriological procedures per se. Expensive investments in laboratory technology may yield low returns unless the programmatic aspects of the diagnostic process are streamlined at the same time.	tuberculosis; diagnosis; antimicrobial drug resistance; multidrug resistance; pulmonary diseases	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; NITRATE REDUCTASE ASSAY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; SPECIMENS; SPUTUM; LIMA; PERU
10.1378_chest.130.1.261	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis - A menace that threatens to destabilize tuberculosis control	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin with or without resistance to other drugs, is a phenomenon that is threatening to destabilize global tuberculosis (TB) control. MDR-TB is a worldwide problem, being present virtually in all countries that were surveyed. According to current World Health Organization and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease estimates, the median prevalence of MDR-TB has been 1.1% in newly diagnosed patients. The proportion, however, is considerably higher (median prevalence, 7%) in patients who have previously received anti-TB treatment. While host genetic factors may contribute to the development of MDR-TB, incomplete and inadequate treatment is the most important factor leading to its development, suggesting that it is often a man made tragedy. Efficiently run TB control programs based on a policy of directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS), are essential for preventing the emergence of MDR-TB. The management of MDR-TB is a challenge that should be undertaken by experienced clinicians at centers equipped with reliable laboratory services for mycobacterial cultures and in vitro sensitivity testing as it the requires prolonged use of costly second-line drugs with a significant potential for toxicity. The judicious use of drugs; supervised standardized treatment; focused clinical, radiologic, and bacteriologic follow-up; and surgery at the appropriate juncture are key factors in the successful management of these patients. With newer effective anti-TB drugs still a distant dream, innovative approaches such as DOTS-Plus are showing promise for the management of patients with MDR-TB under program conditions and appear to be a hope for future.	diagnosis; epidemiology; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; predictors for development; prognostic factors; treatment; tuberculosis	IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS INFECTION; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MDR-TB; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; GLOBAL EPIDEMIOLOGY; BEIJING GENOTYPE; DRUG-RESISTANCE; RISK-FACTORS; DOTS-PLUS; THERAPY
pub-1814	Prevalence of primary drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Mashhad, Iran	Background & objectives: Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has, been a cause of concern in both developed and developing countries. Surveillance data on primary drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis are important to design tuberculosis control programmes. There is a paucity of information about primary. drug resistance in mycobacterium in Iran. We undertook this hospital-based study to assess the prevalence of primary of drug resistant in M. tuberculosis in Mashhad, Iran. Methods: A total of 105 M. tuberculosis isolates from cases with pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, who did not have prior history of anti-tuberculosis treatment, were tested for the drug susceptibility by indirect proportion susceptibility test as per the standard guidelines. Results: Of the 105 isolate:tested, 93 were from pulmonary specimens; and the remaining were extrapulmonary. 79.6 per cent of pulmonary and, 50 per cent of extrapulmonary specimens were smear positive. Resistance to at least one drug was shown by 29.5 per cent, while 2.9 per cent were resistant to more than one drug. MDR-TB was found at 1 per cent of strains. Interpretation & conclusion: Our study showed a high level of resistance to streptomycin and very low resistance to other drugs. To-achieve the higher cure rate, replacement of streptomycin by ethambutol and strict implementation of DOTs may be considered.	ethambutol; isoniazid; multidrug resistance; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; rifampicin; streptomycin	
pub-1815	Frequency and implications of pyrazinamide resistance in managing previously treated tuberculosis patients	OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent of pyrazinamide (PZA) resistance in isolates from previously treated patients from the Western Cape, South Africa. DESIGN: Drug-resistant isolates, isolates resistant to one or more drugs other than PZA (PZA resistance is not routinely determined) (n = 127), and drug-susceptible (n = 47) clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from previously treated patients from the Western Cape were phenotypically (BACTEC MGIT 960) and genotypically (pncA gene sequencing) analysed for PZA resistance. RESULTS: MGIT analysis found that 68 of the 127 drug-resistant isolates were PZA-resistant. Nearly all (63/68) PZA-resistant isolates had diverse nucleotide changes scattered throughout the pncA gene, and five PZA-resistant isolates had no pncA mutations. Of the 47 phenotypi- cally susceptible isolates, 46 were susceptible to PZA, while one isolate was PZA-monoresistant (OR = 53.0, 95%Cl = 7.1-396.5). A pncA polymorphism (Thr(114)Met) that did not confer PZA resistance was also identified. PZA resistance was strongly associated with multidrugresistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). CONCLUSION: An alarmingly high proportion of South African drug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates are PZA resistant, indicating that PZA should not be relied upon in managing patients with MDR-TB in the Western Cape. A method for the rapid detection of PZA resistance would be beneficial in managing patients with suspected drug resistance.	pyrazinamide; pncA; tuberculosis	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PNCA MUTATIONS; PYRAZINOIC ACID; WESTERN CAPE; SUSCEPTIBILITY; STRAIN

METHODS: A panel of 120 multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains was tested blindly by the REMA method and compared with the results obtained using the BACTEC 460 method. RESULT: A very good correlation was observed between the two methods. CONCLUSION: The REMA method is simple, rapid and can be an inexpensive alternative procedure for the rapid detection of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in laboratories with limited resources.

10.1128_JCM.00083_06	Use of genotype MTBDR assay for molecular detection of rifampin and isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical strains isolated in Italy	"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is associated with a high case fatality rate. Rapid identification of resistant strains is crucial for the early administration of appropriate therapy, for prevention of development of further resistance, and to curtail the spread of MDR strains. The Genotype MTBDR (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) is a reverse hybridization line probe assay designed for the rapid detection of rpoB and katG gene mutations in clinical isolates. The ability of this technique to correctly identify resistant and MDR-TB strains was tested on 206 isolates from the Italian drug resistance surveillance system. This panel included the majority, of MDR strains isolated in Italy in the past 3 years. The results of the test were compared to conventional drug susceptibility test performed on isolated strains and verified by sequencing the regions of interest of the bacterial genome. The rate of concordance between the results of the MTBDR and those obtained with ""in vitro"" sensitivity was 91.5% (130 of 142) for rifampin and 67.1% (116 of 173) for isoniazid. We also applied this test directly to a panel of 36 clinical specimens collected from patients with active TB. The MTBDR correctly identified the two cases of MDR-TB included in the panel. These results show that the MTBDR test is useful in the detection and management of tuberculosis when MDR disease is suspected."

10.1371_journal.pmed.0030241	Cost-effectiveness of treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Background Despite the existence of effective drug treatments, tuberculosis ( TB) causes 2 million deaths annually worldwide. Effective treatment is complicated by multidrug-resistant TB ( MDR TB) strains that respond only to second-line drugs. We projected the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of using drug susceptibility testing and second-line drugs in a lower-middle-income setting with high levels of MDR TB. Methods and Findings We developed a dynamic state-transition model of TB. In a base case analysis, the model was calibrated to approximate the TB epidemic in Peru, a setting with a smear-positive TB incidence of 120 per 100,000 and 4.5% MDR TB among prevalent cases. Secondary analyses considered other settings. The following strategies were evaluated: first-line drugs administered under directly observed therapy (DOTS), locally standardized second-line drugs for previously treated cases (STR1), locally standardized second-line drugs for previously treated cases with test-confirmed MDR TB (STR2), comprehensive drug susceptibility testing and individualized treatment for previously treated cases (ITR1), and comprehensive drug susceptibility testing and individualized treatment for all cases (ITR2). Outcomes were costs per TB death averted and costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. We found that strategies incorporating the use of second-line drug regimens following first-line treatment failure were highly cost-effective compared to strategies using first-line drugs only. In our base case, standardized second-line treatment for confirmed MDR TB cases (STR2) had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $720 per QALY ($8,700 per averted death) compared to DOTS. Individualized second-line drug treatment for MDR TB following first-line failure (ITR1) provided more benefit at an incremental cost of $990 per QALY ($12,000 per averted death) compared to STR2. A more aggressive version of the individualized treatment strategy (ITR2), in which both new and previously treated cases are tested for MDR TB, had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $11,000 per QALY ($160,000 per averted death) compared to ITR1. The STR2 and ITR1 strategies remained cost-effective under a wide range of alternative assumptions about treatment costs, effectiveness, MDR TB prevalence, and transmission. Conclusions Treatment of MDR TB using second-line drugs is highly cost-effective in Peru. In other settings, the attractiveness of strategies using second-line drugs will depend on TB incidence, MDR burden, and the available budget, but simulation results suggest that individualized regimens would be cost-effective in a wide range of situations.

10.1086_504526	A multidrug-resistant, acr1-deficient clinical isolate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is unimpaired for replication in macrophages	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) poses a serious threat to global public health. The mutations responsible for drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been identified, but what impact these mutations have on bacterial fitness is controversial. We analyzed 3 MDR strains of M. tuberculosis obtained from human immunodeficiency virus-negative patients with chronic pulmonary TB. One of these strains harbored a chromosomal deletion encompassing 15 open reading frames. Genes deleted in this strain included acr1, which encodes the virulence factor alpha-crystallin (Acr) 1, a protein that has been reported to be essential for M. tuberculosis replication in macrophages. We found that all 3 MDR isolates, including the acr1-deficient strain, replicated in cultured murine and human macrophages with the same kinetics as H37Rv, a virulent laboratory strain. These observations challenge the prevailing view that MDR bacteria are less fit than drug-susceptible bacteria and indicate that Acr1 is dispensable for bacterial growth in the human lung.

10.1021_jm060339h	Discovery of new antitubercular oxazolyl thiosemicarbazones	Twenty 4-( 5-cyclobutyloxazol-2-yl) thiosemicarbazones were synthesized and evaluated for preliminary in vitro and in vivo activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv ( MTB) and multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MDR-TB). Among them, ( 4-bromophenyl)( phenyl) methanone N-( 5-cyclobutyl-1,3-oxazol-2-yl)thiosemicarbazone 6q was found to be the most active compound in vitro with minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.05 mu g/mL against MTB and MDR-TB. In the in vivo animal model 6q decreased the bacterial load in lung and spleen tissues with 2.1 log 10 and 3.72 log 10 protections, respectively, at 50 mg/kg body weight dose.

10.1007_s00063_006_1071_3	Lymph node tuberculosis as primary manifestation of Hodgkin's disease	History and Findings on Admission: A 63-year-old female patient was admitted to the authors' hospital for further diagnostic work-up for suspected reactivation of a previously successfully treated lymph node tuberculosis, which had been diagnosed 1 year prior to the current admission. The clinical signs consisted of worsening of the patient's general condition, cervical lymphadenopathy, night sweats, dyspnea, and superficial inflammation of the right mamma. Findings: A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the neck, thorax and abdomen revealed a generalized enlargement of the cervical, axillar, mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, multiple intrapulmonary nodular lesions with a diameter of up to 6 mm, and a substantial right-sided pleural effusion. Course of Disease: Under the assumption of reactivation of a lymph node tuberculosis, the patient was initially treated with an extended tuberculostatic therapy. Because of disease progression another lymph node biopsy was performed revealing Hodgkin's disease of mixed-cellularity type with a partly histiocytic necrotizing, partly tuberculoid reaction. The biopsy was negative for acid-fast bacilli. Thereupon initiated chemotherapy according to the ABVD protocol led to a rapid amelioration of the clinical symptoms. Conclusion: In the clinical setting of suspected or confirmed lymph node tuberculosis malignant lymphoma should always be considered. This consideration is particular important since Hodgkin's disease is typically associated with a cellular immunosuppression predisposing the subject to tuberculosis.	tuberculosis; TB; Hodgkin's disease; MDR-TB; multiple-drug resistance; lymphogranulomatosis	TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; DOUBLE-BLIND; T-CELLS; IMMUNOLOGY; INFECTION; IMMUNITY; CD8(+); LUNGS
10.1016_j.bmcl.2006.02.065	Gatifloxacin derivatives: Synthesis, antimycobacterial activities, and inhibition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA gyrase	Sixteen 7-substituted gatifloxacin derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antimycobacterial activity in vitro and in vivo against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (MTB) and multi-drug resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB), and also tested for the ability to inhibit the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase from M. tuberculosis. Among the synthesized compounds, 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-8-methoxy-7-[[[N-4-[I'-(5-isatinyl-beta-semicarbazo)]methyl]3-methyl]N-1-piperazinyl]-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylic acid (3d) was found to be the most active compound in vitro with an MIC of 0.0125 mu g/mL against MTB and MTR-TB. In the in vivo animal model 3d decreased the bacterial load in lung and spleen tissues with 3.62- and 3.76-log 10 protections, respectively. Compound 3d was also found to be equally active as gatifloxacin in the inhibition of the supercoiling activity of wild-type M. tuberculosis DNA gyrase with an IC50 of 3.0 mu g/mL. The results demonstrate the potential and importance of developing new quinolone derivatives against mycobacterial infections. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

pub-1823	Public-private collaboration for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis control in New York City	SETTING: An urban tuberculosis control program where an enhanced multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) management plan coordinated care with multiple providers. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate treatment outcomes of primary MDR-TB patients treated by multiple providers. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of tuberculosis patients from 1992-1997 provided that 1) their Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, and 2) they had had <= 30 days of anti-tuberculosis treatment prior to the collection of the first MDR-TB specimen. RESULTS: More than 100 facilities and providers reported 856 MDR-TB patients. Treatment completion reached 70% among non-HIV-infected and 30% among HIV-infected persons; 57.2% of the cohort died prior to treatment completion, 26.5% completed treatment, 16.0% transferred out, refused treatment or were lost to follow-up and 0.2% are still in care. Diagnosis in the later years of the study or cavitation on chest radiograph was independently associated with increased completion among HIV-infected patients. Eight of the 227 (3.5%) patients who completed treatment relapsed (relapse rate 1.01/100 person-years), two with drug-susceptible strains. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive MDR-TB control program improved the outcomes of both HIV-infected and non-infected individuals, despite management by multiple providers. Relapse was infrequent among patients who completed the recommended regimens.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; drug therapy; treatment outcome; treatment effectiveness	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; THERAPY; RIFAMPIN; OUTCOMES; INFECTION; MORTALITY; OUTBREAK; RISK
pub-1824	Risk factors associated with default from multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment, South Africa, 1999-2001	SETTING: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment centers in five provinces, South Africa. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the mortality and evaluate risk factors associated with default from MDR-TB treatment. DESIGN: Using registries and a standardized questionnaire, we conducted a case-control study among patients diagnosed and treated for MDR-TB. Cases were defined as patients who began MDR-TB treatment between 1 October 1999 and 30 September 2001 and defaulted from treatment for more than 2 months; controls were defined as patients who began MDR-TB treatment during the same time and were cured, completed or failed. RESULTS: After initial identification and reclassification, 269 cases and 401 controls were confirmed eligible for interview. Further investigation revealed that 74 (27%) cases and 44 (10%) controls had died. Among 96 cases located who consented and were interviewed, 70% had defaulted after receiving at least 6 months of treatment. In a multivariate model, the strongest individual risk factors for default included reporting smoking marijuana or mandrax during treatment, and having an unsatisfactory opinion about the attitude of health care workers. CONCLUSION: Mortality among MDR-TB defaulters was high. Interventions to reduce default from MDR-TB treatment should center on substance abuse treatment, patient education and support and improving provider-patient relationships.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; treatment default; South Africa	PATIENT ADHERENCE
pub-1825	TB in health care workers in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa	SETTING: Eight public sector hospitals in Ethekwini municipality, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of TB, clinical presentation and treatment outcomes among health care workers (HCWs) in public sector hospitals in Ethekwini Municipality, KwaZulu-Natal. METHODS: A descriptive study using a retrospective record review for the period January 1999 to June 2004 was conducted from July 2004 to February 2005. RESULTS: Five hundred and eighty three HCWs were diagnosed with TB. The mean incidence of TB among HCWs for the study period was 1133.0 per 100000 HCWs (standard deviation 282.8). The incidence of TB was highest in the age group 25-29 years and among paramedical staff (registered health professionals other than doctors and nurses). Clinical presentation of TB in HCWs included pulmonary TB 76.5% (n = 322) and MDR-TB 3% (n = 13). Cure was achieved in 22.2% (n = 118) of HCWs, and 40.7% (n = 212) of HCWs completed their treatment. CONCLUSION: The incidence of TB in HCWs in KwaZulu-Natal is alarmingly high, and the high incidence in the younger age groups and the poor treatment outcomes are cause for concern.	tuberculosis; health care workers; incidence; treatment outcomes	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; NOSOCOMIAL TRANSMISSION; PREVALENCE; PHYSICIANS; RISK; HIV
10.1542_peds.2005_2235	Community-based therapy for children with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	OBJECTIVES. The goals were to describe the management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among children, to examine the tolerability of second-line antituberculosis agents among children, and to report the outcomes of children treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in poor urban communities in Lima, Peru, a city with high tuberculosis prevalence. METHODS. A retrospective analysis of data for 38 children < 15 years of age with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, either documented with drug sensitivity testing of the child's tuberculosis isolate or suspected on the basis of the presence of clinical symptoms for a child with a household contact with documented multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, was performed. All 38 children initiated a supervised individualized treatment regimen for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis between July 1999 and July 2003. Each child received 18 to 24 months of therapy with >= 5 first- or second-line drugs to which their Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain was presumed to be sensitive. RESULTS. Forty-five percent of the children had malnutrition or anemia at the time of diagnosis, 29% had severe radiographic findings (defined as bilateral or cavitary disease), and 13% had extrapulmonary disease. Forty-five percent of the children were hospitalized initially because of the severity of illness. Adverse events were observed for 42% of the children, but no events required suspension of therapy for >= 5 days. Ninety-five percent of the children (36 of 38 children) achieved cures or probable cures, 1 child (2.5%) died, and 1 child (2.5%) defaulted from therapy. CONCLUSIONS. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis disease among children can be treated successfully in resource-poor settings. Treatment is well tolerated by children, and severe adverse events with second-line agents are rare.	tuberculosis; multidrug resistance; international child health	DRUG-RESISTANT; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; CHILDHOOD TUBERCULOSIS; MDR-TB; PEDIATRIC-PATIENTS; YOUNG-CHILDREN; DOTS-PLUS; EXPERIENCE; PERU
pub-1827	Reviving an old idea: can artificial pneumothorax play a role in the modern management of tuberculosis?	OBJECTIVE: To determine the usefulness of artificial pneumothorax (AP) in the management of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients when anti-tuberculosis treatment is ineffective. DESIGN: We evaluated the outcome of therapy in 214 patients with cavitary PTB bacteriologically confirmed by culture treated during 1998-2004, 78.9% of whom had multidrug resistance. AP was applied in 109 patients (56 newly diagnosed TB and 53 retreatment cases). A control group consisted of 105 patients (respectively 55 and 50) treated without AP. The average period of AP application was 4.5 months for newly diagnosed patients and 9 months in retreatment cases. Anti-tuberculosis treatment regimens in both groups were based on drug susceptibility test results. RESULTS: Culture negativity was achieved in patients treated with AP in all new cases and in 81.1% of retreatment cases. Cavity closure occurred in 94.6% and 67.9% respectively. In the control group, culture negativity was achieved in respectively 70.9% and 40.0%, and cavity closure occurred in respectively 56.3% and 24.0%. CONCLUSION: AP considerably improved the treatment outcome in both newly diagnosed and retreatment patients. This procedure can be considered a useful addition in managing certain patients with cavitary TB, particularly those with drug resistance.	tuberculosis; MDR-TB; artificial pneumothorax	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DOTS STRATEGY; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; IMPLEMENTATION; RUSSIA; SURGERY; OUTCOMES; CULTURE
10.1016_j.mimet.2005.08.002	The use of macroarrays for the identification of MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis	The emergence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), resistant to both isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF) (MDR-TB), is an increasing threat to tuberculosis control programs. Susceptibility testing of Mtb complex isolates by phenotypic methods requires a minimum of 14 days from a primary specimen. This can be reduced significantly if molecular analysis is used. Low density oligonucleotide arrays (macroarrays) have been used successfully for the detection of RIF resistance in Mtb. We describe the use of macroarray technology to identify Mtb complex isolates resistant to INH and/or RIF. The macroarray MDR-Mtb screen has been designed to detect Mutations in the RIF resistance determining region (RRDR) of Mtb rpoB and loci in katG and mabA-inhA associated with INH resistance. A panel of Mtb isolates containing 38 different RRDR genotypes, 4 different genotypes within codon 315 of katG and 2 genotypes at mabA-inhA was used to validate the macroarray. The wild type (WT) genotype was correctly identified at all three loci. Of the 37 mutant rpoB genotypes, 36 were correctly detected; the single Mutant not detected contained a 9 base insertion. All mutations within katG and mabA-inhA were correctly identified. We conclude that this low cost, rapid system can usefully detect the mutations associated with the vast majority of MDR-Mtb.

pub-1830	Treatment outcomes in an integrated civilian and prison MDR-TB treatment program in Russia	SETTING: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major problem in countries of the former Soviet Union in both the civilian and prison sectors. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate outcomes of the MDR-TB treatment program (DOTS-Plus) in Tomsk, Russia. DESIGN: Retrospective case series of all patients enrolled in this program between 10 September 2000 and 10 September 2002. The program involves both the civilian and penitentiary TB services in Tomsk. Poor treatment outcome was defined as death, default and treatment failure. RESULTS: Among the 244 patients who received treatment, 77% were cured, 5% died, 7% failed, and 12% defaulted. In a multivariable analysis, alcohol consumption during treatment and the presence of both cavitary and bilateral disease were found to be the strongest predictors of poor treatment outcome. CONCLUSIONS : The integration of civilian and penitentiary TB services in the Tomsk MDR-TB treatment program has resulted in high cure rates and low rates of default. However, alcohol use among patients with MDR-TB is associated with poor treatment outcomes. Better understanding and programmatic alcohol interventions are needed if large-scale treatment of MDR-TB is to be successful in areas with high rates of alcohol use disorders.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; DOTS-Plus; Russia; alcohol	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; RISK-FACTORS; DRUG; DEATH; THERAPY; FAILURE; COHORT; PERU; ERA
pub-1831	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis without HIV infection: success with individualised therapy	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results of the treatment of non-HIV-infected multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients admitted to a tuberculosis unit in a reference centre between June 1998 and December 2000. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were studied (23 men). Empirical treatment was selected according to drugs previously used and adjusted according to in vitro test results. Patients had previously received an average of 5.5 drugs and were resistant to an average of 4.7 drugs. They were treated with a median number of four drugs (an injectable drug plus three oral drugs) for a median of 18 months. Ofloxacin and cycloserine was used in 17 cases (68%), ethionamide/prothionamide in 18 (72%) and para-aminosalicylic acid in 12 patients (48%). Psychological support and counselling was provided. Two patients required surgery. Globally, 21 patients (84%) met cure criteria. After a 24-month follow-up, none of the 21 patients who successfully completed treatment presented relapse or death. CONCLUSION: MDR-TB is a curable disease in non-HIV-infected patients. Individualised treatment regimens should be based on treatment history and the study of in vitro susceptibility and by promoting a relationship with the patient that makes adherence to treatment easier and minimises side effects.	tuberculosis; resistance; multidrug-resistant; treatment	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; REINFECTION; MANAGEMENT; RIFAMPIN; DRUGS; PERU
10.1179_joc.2006.18.2.140	Rapid susceptibility test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis to isoniazid and rifampin with resazurin method in screw-cap tubes	Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis is still a serious public health problem all over the world. MDR tuberculosis (MDR-TB) caused by these strains has emerged within the last decade and rapid detection is critical for the effective treatment of patients. Recently, a resazurin microtiter assay plate for detecting MDR strains was developed. In this study, it was adapted to screw-cap tubes and the activity of isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF) to 50 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates was tested by this method for the first time. Results were compared with the radiometric reference method for the susceptibility testing of M. tuberculosis complex. The results of both methods were in 100% and 96% agreement for RIF and INH, respectively. Specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 91.7%, 100%, 92.8% and 100% for INH, respectively. All of these values were 100% for RIF. Susceptibility testing results were obtained on the 8th day of incubation for 42 isolates and on the 9(th) day for the other eight strains. Our results indicate that this method is suitable for the early determination of INH and RIF resistance in developing countries because it is inexpensive, rapid and easy to perform.

10.1186_1465_9921_7_44	The Directly Observed Therapy Short-Course (DOTS) strategy in Samara Oblast, Russian Federation	Background: The World Health Organisation ( WHO) defines Russia as one of the 22 highest-burden countries for tuberculosis ( TB). The WHO Directly Observed Treatment Short Course ( DOTS) strategy employing a standardised treatment for 6 months produces the highest cure rates for drug sensitive TB. The Russian TB service traditionally employed individualised treatment. The purpose of this study was to implement a DOTS programme in the civilian and prison sectors of Samara Region of Russia, describe the clinical features and outcomes of recruited patients, determine the proportion of individuals in the cohorts who were infected with drug resistant TB, the degree to which resistance was attributed to the Beijing TB strain family and establish risk factors for drug resistance. Methods: prospective study Results: 2,099 patients were recruited overall. Treatment outcomes were analysed for patients recruited up to the third quarter of 2003 ( n = 920). 75.3% of patients were successfully treated. Unsuccessful outcomes occurred in 7.3% of cases; 3.6% of patients died during treatment, with a significantly higher proportion of smear-positive cases dying compared to smear-negative cases. 14.0% were lost and transferred out. A high proportion of new cases ( 948 sequential culture-proven TB cases) had tuberculosis that was resistant to first-line drugs; (24.9% isoniazid resistant; 20.3% rifampicin resistant; 17.3% multidrug resistant tuberculosis). Molecular epidemiological analysis demonstrated that half of all isolated strains (50.7%; 375/740) belonged to the Beijing family. Drug resistance including MDR TB was strongly associated with infection with the Beijing strain ( for MDR TB, 35.2% in Beijing strains versus 9.5% in non-Beijing strains, OR-5.2. Risk factors for multidrug resistant tuberculosis were: being a prisoner ( OR 4.4), having a relapse of tuberculosis ( OR 3.5), being infected with a Beijing family TB strain ( OR 6.5) and having an unsuccessful outcome from treatment ( OR 5.0). Conclusion: The implementation of DOTS in Samara, Russia, was feasible and successful. Drug resistant tuberculosis rates in new cases were high and challenge successful outcomes from a conventional DOTS programme alone.

10.1016_j.chembiol.2006.01.005	Dual inhibition of mycobacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation by 2-alkynoic acids	2-Hexadecynoic acid and 2-octadecynoic acid have cidal activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG. At subinhibitory concentrations, M. smegmatis rapidly transformed [1-C-14]-2-hexadecynoic acid into endogenous fatty acids and elongated them into mycolic acids. Toxic concentrations of 2-hexadecynoic acid resulted in accumulation of 3-ketohexadecanoic acid, which blocked fatty acid biosynthesis, and 3-hexadecynoic acid, an inhibitor of fatty acid degradation. The combination of these two metabolites is necessary to achieve the inhibition of M. smegmatis. We conclude that 2- and 3-hexa/octadecynoic acids inhibit mycolic acid biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and fatty acid degradation, pathways of significant importance for mycobacteria.

pub-1835	Representative drug susceptibility patterns for guiding design of retreatment regimens for MDR-TB	BACKGROUND: There is no gold standard on how national tuberculosis programs should design retreatment regimens. Often drug susceptibility testing (DST) is not available for all patients, and representative DST patterns in patient populations are used to guide therapy. OBJECTIVES: To examine DST patterns in different patient populations based on previous treatment and to estimate the number of effective anti-tuberculosis agents in several retreatment regimens. METHODS: We reviewed DST results from patients treated with individualized regimens in Peru between January 1998 and July 2004. We stratified patients into four groups based on previous treatment exposure from Group 1 who had failed only one regimen to Group 4 who had failed three regimens. We compared resistance frequencies across the four groups. In Groups I and 3, the number of likely effective agents under six possible retreatment regimen scenarios was estimated. RESULTS: Resistance to second-line drugs was significantly higher in groups with more previous courses of treatment. A few retreatment regimens could be identified that would allow at least 80% of patients to receive at least four likely effective drugs. CONCLUSION: Because it is associated with resistance frequencies, previous treatment exposure can serve to guide the design of non-individualized MDR-TB regimens.	retreatment; drug resistance; tuberculosis; standardized; individualized; MDR-TB	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; STANDARDIZED REGIMENS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; EMERGENCE; THERAPY; PERU
10.1016_j.jinf.2005.04.007	Efficacy and safety of linezolid in multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) - a report of ten cases	Objectives: Muttidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is an increasing problem in many parts of the world and in Norway the increase has been substantial since 1998. New therapies for MDR-TB have not been introduced since the fluoroquinotones in the 1970s. The cure rate of this disease has been reported to be lower than for non-drug resistant TB, and the use of new experimental drugs in combination therapy is warranted. Methods: Ten consecutive patients with culture proven MDR-TB were treated with the novel antibiotic drug linezolid in combination regimens for 6-40 (median 17) weeks and followed up 11-50 (median 24) months after end of treatment. All strains were sensitive to linezotid with MIC < 4 mg/l. Treatment was given as direct observed therapy (DOT) and sputum cultures, blood chemistry and neurologic examination were undertaken on a regular basis. Results: Nine patients were cured, one patient with poor adherence to treatment and advanced AIDS died. Seven of 10 patients experienced serious adverse events, which led to withdrawal of linezolid in all seven. Six patients developed peripheral neuropathy and five patients bone marrow depression, blood transfusions were given to three patients and in all five patients bone marrow function normalized after cessation of linezolid. Peripheral neuropathy was not fully reversed in all patients. Conclusion: Linezolid seems highly active in combination treatment of MDR-TB. Cultures became negative 10-37 days after the introduction of the drug. However, peripheral neuropathy and bone marrow depression led to linezolid withdrawal in seven patients, and neuropathy may not be fully reversible in all patients.

10.1097_01.inf.0000199314.88063.4c	Multidrug-resistant tuberculous meningitis in children in Durban, South Africa	Background: Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most frequent manifestation of central nervous system tuberculosis (TB) and is more common in children than in adults. The diagnosis of TBM in children is difficult because signs and symptoms are vague. Information about drug resistant TB in children is scarce, and there is no published information on drug resistant TBM in children. Methods: This is a retrospective review of medical records of children with culture-confirmed multidrug-resistant tuberculous meningitis (MDR-TBM) at King George V Hospital in Durban, South Africa. Results: Between 1992 and 2003, there were 8 children with MDR-TBM: 6 were HIV infected and 2 were HIV negative. Only one child survived. The diagnosis was made posthumously in almost all the children. Discussion: The changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in early TBM can be nonspecific and can change rapidly; therefore, CSF studies should always include culture and susceptibility testing. Factors that contributed to the high mortality were disseminated TB, HIV infection, delay in diagnosis and treatment, the absence of a standardized approach to the management of MDR-TBM and the poor CSF penetration of most MDR-TB drugs. MDR-TB therapy should be considered if there is a history of TB: a MDR-TB contact or a poor clinical response to TB therapy despite adequate adherence to treatment. Early diagnosis is important because TBM in children is often associated with a grave outcome.	multidrug resistant; tuberculosis; meningitis; children	CHILDHOOD TUBERCULOSIS
pub-1838	Prevalence of drug resistance under the DOTS strategy in Hyderabad, South India, 2001-2003	BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB), defined as resistance to at least isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP), is considered a threat to TB control. Implementation of DOTS ensures high cure rates and prevents MDR. OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of MDR-TB from a retrospective analysis of the data in a tuberculosis unit where DOTS was implemented over a period of 6 years through public private mix (PPM). METHODS: Drug susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis samples isolated from the cultures of newly registered and retreatment sputum smear-positive cases during 2001-2003. RESULTS: During the study, 909 sputum-positive cases were registered and analysed. Of these, 714 were new and 195 were retreatment sputum-positive cases. INH resistance was found in 3.2% (23) of new and 9.2% (18) of retreatment cases. RMP resistance was present in 1.5% (11) of new and 7.2% (14) of retreatment cases. MDR was present only in 0.14% (1) of new and 2% (4) of retreatment cases. New cases had cure rates of 96% compared to 85% in retreatment cases. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MDR-TB is low where success rates are high.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB); DOTS strategy	TUBERCULOSIS
pub-1839	Ethambutol resistance testing by mutation detection	OBJECTIVE: To identify chromosomal mutations that confer resistance to ethambutol (EMB) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. DESIGN: Drug-resistant (n = 235) and drug-susceptible (n = 117) M. tuberculosis isolates collected from the Western Cape in South Africa were subjected to embB gene analysis and the results were compared to phenotypic EMB testing. RESULTS: Genotypic analysis identified mutations at codon 306 of the embB gene in 20% (47/235) of the resistant isolates in comparison to only 1.7% (4/23S) of those that were phenotypically resistant to EMB by the agar diffusion method. No gene mutations were detected in susceptible isolates. Phenotypic retesting in BACTEC demonstrated that the 47 genotypically resistant isolates were phenotypically resistant to EMB. This implies that 91.4% (43/47) of EMB resistance had been phenotypically missed by routine laboratory procedures. EMB resistance was closely linked to multidrug resistance (MDR); 87.2% (41/47) of the EMB-resistant isolates were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin. A newly developed one-step amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) method correctly detected the EMB-resistant genotype. CONCLUSION: Implementation of more accurate diagnosis of EMB resistance may enhance patient management in South Africa, as standardised treatment of MDR-TB with second-line drugs is currently dependent on the outcome of the EMB resistance test.	genotyping; phenotyping; drug resistance; Mycobacterium tuberculosis	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; EMBB; COMPLEX
10.1016_j.bmc.2005.07.045	Triketones active against antibiotic-resistant bacteria: Synthesis, structure-activity relationships, and mode of action	A series of acylated phloroglucinols and triketones was synthesized and tested for activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) and multi-drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB). A tetra-methylated triketone with a C-12 side chain was the most active compound (MIC of around 1.0 mu g/ml against MRSA) and was shown to stimulate oxygen consumption by resting cell suspensions, suggesting that the primary target was the cytoplasmic membrane.

pub-1841	Molecular epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in China: a nationwide random survey in 2000	OBJECTIVE: To determine the contribution of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) Beijing genotype-to the population structure of M. tuberculosis complex in China. DESIGN: Genotypes of 441 mycobacterial isolates were determined by spoligotyping and IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The isolates were from a nationwide random survey for the epidemiology of TB conducted in 2000, and the drug susceptibility patterns and epidemiological data were known. RESULT: A total of 40 8 samples contained M. tuberculosis as determined by spoligotyping. Of the M. tuberculosis strains, 64.9% (265/408) were of the Beijing genotype. Using the X-2 test, no statistically significant differences were observed in the proportion of Beijing genotype TB in patients of different sex, age or living in different areas of the country, but a significant difference was observed with multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB: 77.8% (42/54) of MDR isolates were of the Beijing genotype vs. 60.2% (213/354) of the drug-susceptible isolates. In the multivariate logistic regression model, the Beijing genotype was significantly associated with region and not with MDR. CONCLUSION: The M. tuberculosis Beijing genotype has prevailed in China for at least five decades and is associated with region.

pub-1842	Side effects associated with the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: Sureyyapasa Centre for Chest Diseases and Thoracic Surgery, Istanbul, Turkey. OBJECTIVE: To report the frequency of treatment side effects in cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) tuberculosis. DESIGN: A retrospective review of the medical records of 263 patients who received individualised treatment for MDR-TB between April 1992 and June 2004. RESULTS: One or more side effects developed in 182 cases (69.2%). These effects led the clinicians to withdraw one or more drugs from the treatment regimen in 146 cases (55.5%). Side effects observed most frequently included: ototoxicity (41.8%), psychiatric disorders (21.3%), gastrointestinal disturbance (14.0%), arthralgia (11.4%), epileptic seizures (9.9%), hepatitis (4.5%), and dermatological effects (4.5%). At the time of analysis, treatment was successful in 204 (77.6%) cases. Fifty-nine patients (22.4%) had poor outcomes. CONCLUSION: Timely and aggressive management of drug side effects means that high side effect rates in MDR-TB treatment need not compromise success rates.	tuberculosis; side effects; multidrug resisistance	THERAPY
10.1186_1465_9921_6_134	The Beijing genotype and drug resistant tuberculosis in the Aral Sea region of Central Asia	Background: After the collapse of the Soviet Union, dramatically increasing rates of tuberculosis and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) have been reported from several countries. This development has been mainly attributed to the widespread breakdown of TB control systems and declining socio-economic status. However, recent studies have raised concern that the Beijing genotype of Mycobacterium tuberculosis might be contributing to the epidemic through its widespread presence and potentially enhanced ability to acquire resistance. Methods: A total of 397 M. tuberculosis strains from a cross sectional survey performed in the Aral Sea region in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have been analysed by drug susceptibility testing, IS6110 fingerprinting, and spoligotyping. Results: Fifteen isolates showed mixed banding patterns indicating simultaneous infection with 2 strains. Among the remaining 382 strains, 152 (40%) were grouped in 42 clusters with identical fingerprint and spoligotype patterns. Overall, 50% of all isolates were Beijing genotype, with 55% of these strains appearing in clusters compared to 25% of non-Beijing strains. The percentage of Beijing strains increased with increasing drug resistance among both new and previously treated patients; 38% of fully-susceptible isolates were Beijing genotype, while 75% of MDR-TB strains were of the Beijing type. Conclusion: The Beijing genotype is a major cause of tuberculosis in this region, it is strongly associated with drug resistance, independent of previous tuberculosis treatment and may be strongly contributing to the transmission of MDR-TB. Further investigation around the consequences of Beijing genotype infection for both tuberculosis transmission and outcomes of standard short course chemotherapy are urgently needed.

10.1016_j.ijid.2004.09.012	Treatment of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Iran	Setting: Masih Daneshvari Hospital, Tehran, Iran, 2000-2002. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment for the first time in Iran. Design: All cases of MDR-TB with complete follow-up data were recruited and results of their treatments were evaluated. Results: MDR-TB treatment was initiated with 5.23 drugs, on average. Isoniazid, amikacin, and ofloxacin were present in the drug regimen of all patients. Average duration of the treatment was 18.5 months (range, 7-36). Over 76% of the patients responded to the treatment (negative smear and culture). Cure and probable cure were documented in seven (41.2%) and four (23.5%) of the patients, respectively. No failure in the treatment occurred when cycloserine was present in the treatment regimen. Conclusion: A majority of the MDR-TB patients in Iran can be cured with the use of appropriate treatment regimens. An even greater success could be achieved by providing more second-line drugs.

10.1016_j.mimet.2005.03.002	Comparison of drug resistance genotypes between Beijing and non-Beijing family strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Korea	The frequency of resistance genotypes among Beijing and non-Beijing strains was compared using a reverse blot hybridization assay to detect mutations within genes associated with rifampicin (rpoB) and isoniazid (katG, inhA, and ahpC) resistance. Of the 743 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, 569 (77%) belonged to Beijing family. The proportion of Beijing strains was significantly higher among MDR-TB isolates than among drug-susceptible strains (82% vs. 72%, p <0.01). Genotype analysis of the rpoB gene revealed significantly lower rates of the Ser531Leu mutation rate among Beijing vs. non-Beijing MDR-TB strains (41 % vs. 66%, p < 0.005). While the mutation for Ser315Thr in the katG gene was more common among Beijing vs. non-Beijing family strains (65% vs. 50%, p<0.01), the mutation rate of promoter region of the inhA gene was lower among Beijing strains compared with non-Beijing strains (14% vs. 25%, p<0.05). Reverse hybridization successfully detected over 80% of isoniazid-resistant strains and over 92% of rifampicin-resistant strains among Korean isolates. Significant differences in mutation rates in the rpoB, katG, and inhA genes between Beijing strains and non-Beijing strains could explain discrepancies in mutation rates of genotypes in different countries. Reverse hybridization was useful for rapid detection of isoniazid and rifampicin resistant strains. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

10.1080_00365540500265065	Drug-resistant tuberculosis in Yangon, Myanmar	The extent of drug resistant tuberculosis ( TB) in the capital city of Myanmar, Yangon has not yet been reported. This study aimed to determine the proportion and pattern of drug resistance to first-line anti-TB drugs, among Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates from sputum smear positive TB patients who attended National TB Programme Yangon centres in April-August and October-December 2002. Drug susceptibility was determined by the Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube manual system (Becton Dickinson, MD, USA). Of the 567 patients, sputum specimens from 447 (79%) had a positive culture. Of these, 357 isolates (80%) had a susceptibility test result. Isolates from 76 of 259 (29.3%) new patients and from 45 of 98 (45.9%) previously treated patients were resistant to at least 1 of the anti-TB drugs. Resistance to isoniazid (INH) (22.0% vs 40.8%: new vs previously treated patients) and to >= 2 drugs (17.8% vs 29.6%: new vs previously treated patients) was common. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) among new and previously treated patients was 4.2% and 18.4%, respectively. INH-resistant (adjusted OR: 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.6) and MDR-TB (adjusted OR: 3.4, 95% CI 1.4-8.3) cases were more likely to have taken anti-TB drugs >= 1 month previously. Collectively, prevalence of MDR-TB and TB resistance to >= 2 drugs are not rare in Yangon.		MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS; IMPACT
pub-1847	Does one size fit all? Drug resistance and standard treatments: results of six tuberculosis programmes in former Soviet countries	SETTING: After the collapse of the Soviet Union, countries in the region faced a dramatic increase in tuberculosis cases and the emergence of drug resistance. OBJECTIVE: To discuss the relevance of the DOTS strategy in settings with a high prevalence of drug resistance. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of one-year treatment outcomes of short-course chemotherapy (SCC) and results of drug susceptibility testing (DST) surveys of six programmes located in the former Soviet Union: Kemerovo prison, Russia; Abkhasia, Georgia; Nagorno-Karabagh, Azerbaijan; Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan; Dashoguz Velayat, Turkmenistan; and South Kazakhstan Oblast, Kazakhstan. Results are reported for new and previously treated smear-positive patients. RESULTS: Treatment outcomes of 3090 patients and DST results of 1383 patients were collected. Treatment success rates ranged between 87% and 61%, in Nagorno-Karabagh and Kemerovo, respectively, and failure rates between 7% and 23%. Any drug resistance ranged between 66% and 31% in the same programmes. MDR rates ranged between 28% in Karakalpakstan and Kemerovo prison and 4% in Nagorno-Karabagh. CONCLUSION: These results show the limits of SCC in settings with a high prevalence of drug resistance. They demonstrate that adapting treatment according to resistance patterns, access to reliable culture, DST and good quality second-line drugs are necessary.	tuberculosis; treatment outcomes; drug resistance; Eastern Europe	SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MDR-TB; DOTS; AZERBAIJAN; RECURRENCE; INFECTION; OUTCOMES; FAILURE
pub-1848	Rifampicin and isoniazid resistance mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated from patients in Kazakhstan	OBJECTIVE: To analyse possible associations of specific mutations conferring rifampicin (RMP) and isoniazid (INH) resistance with Beijing and non Beijing genotype strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from Kazakhstan. METHOD: Genotypic analysis of 92 multidrug-resistant (MDR), 50 INH but not RMP-resistant (INHr/RMPs) and 10 fully susceptible strains of M. tuberculosis from Kazakhstan was performed. In the MDR group, 59 strains (64.1%), and within the INHr/RMPs group, 32 strains (64.0%) were classified,as Beijing genotype. RESULTS: Analysis of the rpoB gene of the MDR strains revealed 10 different mutations in five codons, with rpoB codons 531 (65.2%), 526 (23.9%) and 516 (7.6%) most frequently affected. A significantly higher proportion of the rpoB S531L mutation was found among Beijing genotype strains compared with non Beijing strains (71.2% vs. 46.2%, P = 0.027). All 92 MDR isolates (100%), irrespective of their genotype, carried a mutation in codon 315 of the katG gene (S315T). However, in the INHr/RMPs control group, the S315T mutation was significantly more prevalent in the Beijing than in the non Beijing group (96.9% vs. 71.4%, P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: The high similarity of mutations supports the assumption that transmission of resistant strains is a major reason for the emergence of drug resistance in this region.

pub-1849	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis outbreak among transvestite sex workers, Buenos Aires, Argentina	We describe the first outbreak of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) that occurred in Argentina among transvestite sex workers, and actions undertaken for its control. In Buenos Aires city, transmission was documented between 2001 and 2004 by conventional and molecular methods in a hotel where transvestites used to reside and work. The source case was traced back to 1998. Six secondary cases were diagnosed and treated. Thirty-two contacts were investigated. The outbreak strain had formerly caused nosocomial transmission in Rosario, a city 300 km from Buenos Aires. Our findings highlight the difficulties controlling MDR-TB in Argentina.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; transvestite; epidemic outbreak	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS
10.1016_j.jint.2005.05.017	Bacteriophage-based assays for the rapid detection of rifampicin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis: a meta-analysis	Objective: To summarize, using meta-analysis, the accuracy of bacteriophage-based assays for the detection of rifampicin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Methods: By searching multiple databases and sources we identified a total of 21 studies eligible for meta-analysis. Of these, 14 studies used phage amplification assays (including eight studies on the commercial FASTPlaque-TB (R) kits), and seven used Luciferase reporter phage (LRP) assays. Sensitivity, specificity, and agreement between phage assay and reference standard (e.g. agar proportion method or BACTEC 460) results were the main outcomes of interest. Results: When performed on culture isolates (N = 19 studies), phage assays appear to have relatively high sensitivity and specificity. Eleven of 19 (58%) studies reported sensitivity and specificity estimates >= 95%, and 13 of 19 (68%) studies reported : 95% agreement with reference standard results. Specificity estimates were slightly lower and more variable than sensitivity; 5 of 19 (26%) studies reported specificity < 90%. Only two studies performed phage assays directly on sputum specimens; although one study reported sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 99%, respectively, another reported sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 73%. Conclusions: Current evidence is largely restricted to the use of phage assays for the detection of rifampicin resistance in culture isolates. When used on culture isolates, these assays appear to have high sensitivity, but variable and slightly lower specificity. In contrast, evidence is lacking on the accuracy of these assays when they are directly applied to sputum specimens. If phage-based assays can be directly used on clinical specimens and if they are shown to have high accuracy, they have the potential to improve the diagnosis of MDR-TB. However, before phage assays can be successfully used in routine practice, several concerns have to be addressed, including unexplained false positives in some studies, potential for contamination and indeterminate results.

10.1111_j.1365_2249.2005.02872.x	Detection of in vitro interferon-gamma and serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is known as having a poor prognosis with a weak response to therapy and very high death rates. The aim of this work was to assess the immune response to the RD1-encoded antigen ESAT-6 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in MDR-TB patients and compare to non-resistant (NR) TB patients and healthy controls (HC). Evaluation of interferon (IFN)-gamma production showed that, although 55% of the MDR patients were responsive to ESAT-6, they produced lower IFN-gamma levels (553 +/- 11 pg/ml) when compared to NR-TB (1179 +/- 163 pg/ml; P < 0.05) but not to controls (412 +/- 65.7 pg/ml). Differences in the response to ESAT-6 and to its overlapping peptides mixture were also significant between MDR versus treated pulmonary NR-TB. Furthermore, a very low rate of response to PPD (23.5%) and to Ag85B (33.3%) was noted in MDR-TB patients as compared to the other groups. To determine the inflammatory response in patients' groups, detection of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was assessed in their sera before and during chemotherapy. Mean TNF-alpha levels in MDR-TB (43.8 +/- 9 pg/ml) paralleled those found in treated pulmonary, and it was significantly different (P < 0.05) from the values found in untreated NR and HC. Interestingly, secretion of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were predominant in MDR patients who presented with bilateral pulmonary lesions and lung cavitation. The present data indicate that the overall immune response to mycobacterial antigens is decreased in resistant TB and the major role inflammatory cytokines may play in perpetuating pulmonary tissue damage.

10.1183_09031936.05.00006205	High hepatotoxicity of pyrazinamide and ethambutol for treatment of latent tuberculosis	Pyrazinamide (PZA) combined with either ethambutol (EMB) or a fluoroquinolone for 6-12 months is one of the treatments recommended for latent tuberculosis infection (ILTBI) in contacts exposed to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The aim of the present study was to describe the side effects related to combined PZA and EMB treatment given for ILTBI, in contacts previously exposed to MDR-TB. In total, 12 consecutive contacts, all of African origin and aged 38 +/- 5 yrs, were treated with daily PZA (23 +/- 4 mg center dot kg(-1)) and EMB (17 +/- 4 mg center dot kg(-1)) at Geneva University Hospital outpatient clinic (Switzerland), as a result of contact-tracing procedures for two patients with contagious MDR-TB. Clinical status and liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase (ALAT) and alanine aminotransferase (ASAT)) were monitored monthly. In seven cases (58%) treatment was discontinued after a median of 119 days, due to hepatic toxicity in six cases (ALAT or ASAT elevation more than four times the upper normal limit), and gastrointestinal symptoms in one case. In conclusion, combined pyrazinamide and ethambutol for latent tuberculosis infection may be associated with a high risk of hepatic toxicity, and warrants close monitoring. There is clearly a need for alternative preventive treatments for contacts exposed to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.	ethambutol; hepatotoxicity; latent tuberculous infection; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; pyrazinamide; treatment	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; PREVENTIVE THERAPY; RIFAMPIN; INFECTION; OFLOXACIN
pub-1854	Risk factors for drug-resistant tuberculosis among non-US-born persons in New York City	SETTING: New York City (NYC). OBJECTIVES: To examine the extent to which prior tuberculosis (TB) treatment, length of residence in the United States and other factors are associated with the occurrence of drug resistance among non-US-born persons in NYC. DESIGN: Cases were non-US-born persons diagnosed with TB in NYC from 1998-1999 and from 20012002, with an initial Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate resistant to any first-line anti-tuberculosis drug. Controls were randomly selected from non-US-born persons whose isolates were susceptible to all first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. RESULTS: Overall, cases with multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB were more likely to have had prior TB treatment; other drug resistance was not associated with prior TB treatment. In a multivariate model, the relationship between MDR-TB and prior treatment remained significant for non-US-born persons regardless of length of time in the US. CONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore the utility of monitoring trends in drug resistance among the non-US-born by time in the US and prior treatment to determine where or when drug resistance may be occurring.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; immigration	UNITED-STATES; PREDICTORS
pub-1855	A population-based study of drug resistance and transmission of tuberculosis in an urban community	SETTING: A low-income neighborhood of Sao Paulo, Brazil. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence, risk factors and transmission patterns of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal study of patients with pulmonary TB (PTB). METHODS: Sputum culture-confirmed patients with PTB were recruited between March 2000 and May 2002. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with MDR-TB. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were tested for drug susceptibility and typed by IS6110-RFLP analysis. RESULTS: Of 420 patients, respectively 71% and 27% were new and previously treated; 15.5% of the patients'M. tuberculosis isolates were resistant to at least one drug; of these, 11% and 27% were found among new and previously treated cases, respectively. Respectively 1% and 16.7% of the new and previously treated cases were MDR-TB. RFLP analysis showed that new transmission of MDR strains was uncommon. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, previous TB and hospitalization in the 24 months before TB diagnosis were identified as independent predictors of MDR-TB. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed an intermediate level of MDR-TB incidence in a neighborhood of Sao Paulo and identified predictors that can be targeted for intervention by national and local TB control programs.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; RFLP; risk factors	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; STRAIN; EPIDEMIOLOGY; OUTBREAK

The sensitivity when compared to conventional identification/culture methods was 82.2%, and the specificity was 66.7%; the sensitivity and specificity were 100.0% and 96.9%, respectively, for the detection of RIF resistance. This assay has the potential to provide rapid information that is essential for the effective management of MDR-TB.		NEW-YORK-CITY; DRUG-RESISTANCE; RPOB GENE; MUTATIONS; DIAGNOSIS; COUNTRIES
10.1258_0956462054679124	Impact of an effective multidrug-resistant tuberculosis control programme in the setting of an immature HIV epidemic: system dynamics simulation model	This study sought to determine the impact of an effective programme of multidrug resistant tuberculosis control (MDRTB) on a population that is witnessing an explosive HIV epidemic among injecting drug users (IDUs), where the prevalence of MDRTB is already high. A transmission model was constructed that represents the dynamics of the drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DSTB), MDRTB and HIV spread among the adult population of Samara Oblast, Russia: from official notifications of tuberculosis and of HIV infection, estimates of MDRTB derived from surveillance studies, population data from official regional statistics, data on transmission probabilities from peer-reviewed publications and informed estimates, and policy-makers' estimates of IDU populations. Two scenarios of programme effectiveness for MDRTB were modelled and run over a period of 10 years to predict cumulative deaths. In a population of 3.3 million with a high prevalence of MDRTB, an emerging epidemic of HIV among IDUs, and a functioning directly observed therapy-short course (DOTS) programme, the model predicts that under low cure rates for MDRTB the expected cumulative deaths from tuberculosis will reach 6303 deaths including 1900 deaths from MDRTB at 10 years. Under high cure rate for MDRTB 4465 deaths will occur including 134 deaths from MDRTB. At 10 years there is little impact on HIV-infected populations from the MDRTB epidemic, but as the HIV epidemic matures the impact becomes substantial. When the model is extended to 20 years cumulative deaths from MDRTB become very high if cure rates for MDRTB are low and cumulative deaths in the HIV-infected population, likewise, are profoundly affected. In the presence of an immature HIV epidemic failure to actively control MDRTB may result in approximately a third more deaths than if effective treatment is given. As the HIV epidemic matures then the impact of MDRTB grows substantially if MDRTB control strategies are ineffective. The epidemiological starting point for these scenarios is present in many regions within the former Soviet Union and this analysis suggests control of MDRTB should be an urgent priority.

pub-1858	Anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in patients with HIV and tuberculosis in South India	SETTING: Tuberculosis Research Centre clinics at Chennai and Madurai, Tamil Nadu, South India. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and pattern of drug resistance among patients with HIV and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of HIV-positive patients with PTB between January 2001 and May 2003. Sputum mycobacterial culture and drug susceptibility testing were performed. RESULTS: A total of 204 patients with positive sputum cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were included; 167 of them were new cases, and 37 had a history of previous anti-tuberculosis treatment for > 1 month. Among the former, resistance to isoniazid (INH) was observed in 22 (13%) and MDR-TB in 7 (4.2%). Reported resistance rates in this geographic area among new cases ranged from 15% to 28% for INH and 2.8% to 3.4% for MDR (INH + rifampicin [RMP]). In contrast, among HIV-positive patients with a history of previous treatment, resistance was found to INH in 10 (27%) and to RMP in 7 (18.9%), while MDR-TB was seen in 5 (13.5%) patients. CONCLUSION: Among new TB patients, MDR-TB is marginally higher in HIV-positive patients than in the non-HIV-infected population in this region. Standard treatment guidelines should be followed. Higher rates of drug resistance are observed among previously treated patients.	tuberculosis; HIV; anti-tuberculosis drug resistance; MDR-TB	IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS INFECTION; MALABSORPTION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; THAILAND; OUTBREAK
10.1186_1471_2334_5_62	A commercial line probe assay for the rapid detection of rifampicin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis	Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a leading cause of death worldwide. In multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) infectiousness is frequently prolonged, jeopardizing efforts to control TB. The conventional tuberculosis drug susceptibility tests are sensitive and specific, but they are not rapid. The INNO-LiPA Rif. TB(R) (LiPA) is a commercial line probe assay designed to rapidly detect rifampicin resistance, a marker of MDR-TB. Although LiPA has shown promising results, its overall accuracy has not been systematically evaluated. Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the accuracy of LiPA for the detection of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis among culture isolates and clinical specimens. We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, BIOSIS, and Google Scholar, and contacted authors, experts and the manufacturer. Fifteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 11 studies used culture isolates, one used clinical specimens, and three used both. We used a summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve and Q* index to perform meta-analysis and summarize diagnostic accuracy. Results: Twelve of 14 studies that applied LiPA to isolates had sensitivity greater than 95%, and 12 of 14 had specificity of 100%. The four studies that applied LiPA directly to clinical specimens had 100% specificity, and sensitivity that ranged between 80% and 100%. The SROC curve had an area of 0.99 and Q* of 0.97. Conclusion: LiPA is a highly sensitive and specific test for the detection of rifampicin resistance in culture isolates. The test appears to have relatively lower sensitivity when used directly on clinical specimens. More evidence is needed before LiPA can be used to detect MDR-TB among populations at risk in clinical practice.

pub-1860	The in vitro activity of phenothiazines against Mycobacterium avium: Potential of thioridazine for therapy of the co-infected AIDS patient	Patients presenting with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) are predisposed to co-injection with Mycobacterium avium. The management of such patients is problematic due to underlying immuno-incompetence and the high resistance of M. avium to most non-toxic compounds. Therefore, the need for effective agents is obvious. Because phenothiazines, especially the relatively mild thioridazine, have significant activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we investigated the in vitro activity of chlorpromazine, thioridazine, promazine, promethazine and desipramine against a reference and clinical strains of M. avium. The results obtained show that whereas all of the phenothiazines employed in this study had an minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the strains studied that ranged from ca. 10 to > 50 mg/L, as was previously shown for M. tuberculosis, thioridazine was the most active of the group against M. avium. Phenothiazines have been shown to have in vitro activity against sensitive and drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (1-4). Nevertheless, the concentrations of these agents necessary to inhibit the growth of these bacteria is well beyond that clinically possible (5-8). However, chlorpromazine has activity against intracellular antibiotic-susceptible (9, 10) and antibiotic-resistant intracellular strains of M tuberculosis (10) at concentrations in the medium which are similar (9) or below (10) those that are clinically employed. Because chlorpromazine causes frequent and serious side-effects when administered chronically (11), it is not a drug of choice for the management of multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) infections. However, since the milder phenothiazine, thioridazine, is as effective in vitro (3, 4) and ex vivo (phagocytosed) MDR-TB (10) as is chlorpromazine (10), the use of thioridazine for the management of MDR-TB, where all other derivatives have failed, has been suggested (7, 12). Chlorpromazine was shown by Crowle et al., in 1992, to have activity against M avium that had been phagocytosed by human macrophages at concentrations in the medium which were similar to those employed for the therapy of psychosis (9). Based upon this evidence, we studied the in vitro activity of chlorpromazine and four other phenothiazines conventionally employed for the management of psychosis against strains of M avium.

pub-1861	Validation of a rapid method for detection of M-tuberculosis resistance to isoniazid and rifampin in Lima, Peru	SETTING: Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is often based on drug susceptibility testing (DST) results; for this reason, rapid, simple DST methods are sought which could be applied in resource-poor countries. One such method is a nitrate reductase colorimetric assay known as the Griess method. In Peru, where the incidence rate of TB is among the highest in South America, the National Institute of Health recently undertook the validation and implementation of the direct Griess method. OBJECTIVE: To describe the process of validation and implemention of the direct Griess method at the Peruvian National Institute of Health. DESIGN: Prospective study comparing the sensitivity and specificity of the direct Griess method with the Lowenstein-Jensen proportion method in determining resistance to isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RMP) among clinical isolates. RESULTS: Among 192 specimens, the sensitivity and specificity of the Griess method for detection of INH resistance was 99.1% and 100%, respectively. For identification of RMP resistance, the sensitivity and specificity was 93.5% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to its high sensitivity and specificity and rapid turn around time, the Griess method uses simple, inexpensive reagents and requires minimal laboratory space and technical expertise, thus providing an ideal screening tool for resource-poor settings with high rates of MDR-TB.	tuberculosis; diagnosis; drug resistance; MDR	DRUG SUSCEPTIBILITY; ASSAY; CHEMOTHERAPY; PROGRAMS
pub-1862	Outcomes of individualised treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis before DOTS-Plus	SETTING: A tuberculosis (TB) out-patient service in the city of Santa Cruz, Bolivia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes of patients with TB resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin (multidrug resistance [MDR]) treated in a resource-poor area before the introduction of the DOTS-Plus initiative. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of MDR-TB patients treated with individualised regimens between January 1983 and December 1993. RESULTS: Among 143 patients studied, 73 (51%) were males; the mean age was 33.9 years. Forty (28%) were new patients and 103 (72%) were previously treated patients. The treatment regimen had to be modified in 122 (85%) patients. A successful outcome was achieved in 41 (28%) patients; 68 (48%) defaulted, 18 (13%) died, and 14 (10%) were still under treatment in 1996. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment approach described had dismal results. The capacity for performing drug susceptibility testing and the availability of several second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs were not sufficient to achieve cure in more than one third of the patients treated. Other factors, such as a set of standard procedures, clear guidelines for the treatment and follow-up of patients and the administration of directly observed treatment, must be included in a programme for treating MDR-TB, to obtain better treatment results.	tuberculosis; multidrug resistance; Bolivia; DOTS Plus	SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; MDR-TB; COUNTRIES; DRUGS; CITY
pub-1863	Acquisition of drug resistance in multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis during directly observed empiric retreatment with standardized regimens	The risk of acquiring additional drug resistance in strains of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) during failure of empiric standardized retreatment regimens is poorly defined. We sought to estimate this risk by comparing drug susceptibility profiles and RFLP patterns of paired MDR-TB isolates collected from 27 patients before and after retreatment failure. Among 23 patients with paired isolates with concordant RFLP patterns, 19 (83%) had become resistant to at least one additional drug after failed retreatment. In this limited group of MDR-TB patients, acquisition of resistance was common during failure of empiric drug regimens. Further study is needed to confirm these findings.	resistance amplification; retreatment; empiric; Peru; DOTS-Plus	2ND-LINE; FAILURE; STRAIN
10.1093_jac_dki148	Linezolid for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Objectives: In vitro studies have shown good activity of linezolid against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including multidrug-resistant strains. However, clinical experience with linezolid in tuberculosis is scarce. Methods: We report our clinical experience with five consecutive patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis infection treated with combination regimens that included linezolid. Results: Two patients had multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium bovis infection, with resistance to 12 antituberculous agents (one of them with HIV co-infection and < 50 CD4 cells/mm(3)). The other three patients were infected by multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains, with resistance to all first-line drugs and other second-line drugs. All patients received linezolid in combination with thiacetazone, clofazimine or amoxicillin/clavulanate. Susceptibility tests showed linezolid MIC values <= 0.5 mg/L against all tuberculosis strains tested (standard proportion method, Middlebrook agar 7H10). In all cases, tuberculosis cultures from respiratory samples were sterile after 6 weeks of therapy. Three patients have clinical and microbiological cure of tuberculosis with a combination regimen with linezolid (range: 5-24 months). One patient was lost to follow-up at month 5. The remaining patient has completed 11 months of therapy and is still on treatment. Four patients developed anaemia and needed blood transfusions. In two of these patients, the linezolid daily-dose (600 mg twice a day) was successfully reduced to 50% (300 mg twice a day) to decrease toxicity while maintaining efficacy. Peripheral neuropathy (two patients) and pancreatitis (one patient) were other adverse events observed during linezolid treatment. Conclusions: In our experience, linezolid has been a valid alternative drug in the management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. The prolonged use of linezolid is frequently associated with toxicity, mainly anaemia and peripheral neuropathy, that requires special management.	oxazolidinones; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Mycobacterium bovis; MDR-TB	IN-VITRO ACTIVITY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY; QUINUPRISTIN-DALFOPRISTIN; STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; METHICILLIN-RESISTANT; INDUCED ANEMIA; INFECTION; FLUOROQUINOLONES; VANCOMYCIN
10.1001_jama.293.22.2732	Multidrug resistance among persons with tuberculosis in California, 1994-2003	"Context Between 1994 and 2003, tuberculosis (TB) cases in California declined 33% (4834 to 3224). However, in 2003 California reported the largest number of cases in the nation, and over the past decade the proportion of cases with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has not decreased. Objective To describe the magnitude, trends, geographic distribution, clinical characteristics, risk factors, and outcomes of MDR-TB cases reported to the California registry of Reports of Verified Cases of TB. Design, Setting, and Cases Analysis of 38 291 TB cases reported from all 61 local health jurisdictions in California during 1994-2003. Multidrug-resistant TB was defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin. Main Outcome Measures Results of univariate and multivariable analyses of MDR-TB magnitude, trends, geographic distribution, clinical characteristics, associated factors, and outcomes. Results Of 38 291 reported TB cases, 28 712 (75%) were tested for resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin; of these, 407 MDR-TB cases (1.4%) were reported from 38 of 61 California health jurisdictions (62%); the proportion of MDR-TB cases did not significantly change over the study period (P=.87). Cases of MDR-TB were twice as likely to have cavitary lesions compared with non-MDR-TB cases (P<.001) and were 7 times more likely to have reported previous treatment for TB (P<.001). Of MDR-TB cases with outcomes, 231 (67%) completed therapy, and those with MDR-TB were significantly less likely to complete therapy than those without MDR-TB (P<.001). Multivariate analysis identified previous TB diagnosis, positive acid-fast bacilli sputum smear results, Asian/Pacific Islander ethnicity, time in the United States less than 5 years at the time of diagnosis, and outcomes of ""died"" and ""moved"" as factors associated with MDR-TB. Conclusions Multidrug-resistant TB, an airborne disease with limited, costly treatment options, persists in 1% to 2 % of all cases despite California's control efforts. Local and global TB control efforts are needed to prevent the further development and spread of MDR-TB."

10.1016_j.ijantimicag.2005.01.021	Activity of RBx 7644 and RBx 8700, new investigational oxazolidinones, against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected murine macrophages	The decision to develop a new chemical entity should not only be based on its ability to inhibit multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains but also on its ability to enter macrophages and be active against intracellular bacteria. RBx 7644 and RBx 8700, two novel extended spectrum oxazolidinones, were investigated for their activity against sensitive and MDR isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and for activity against bacteria within a macrophage cell line. RBx 8700 showed excellent in vitro activity against sensitive as well as MDR M. tuberculosis strains with MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.032 and 0.25 mg/L (sensitive) and 0.25 and 1.0 mg/L (MDR) strains. The corresponding MIC50 and MIC90 values of RBx 7644, linezolid, rifampicin and isoniazid were 8 and 16; 32 and 64; 64 and 64; 64 and 64 mg/L, respectively. RBx 8700 and rifampicin were bactericidal at 0.5 and 0.25 mg/L when tested intracellularly whereas linezolid reduced the count by 100-fold at a concentration of 8 mg/L. In combination studies with standard anti mycobacterial drugs, RBx 8700 did not show any antagonistic effect. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.

pub-1867	Speaking the same language: treatment outcome definitions for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: Globally it is estimated that 273000 new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB, resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin) occurred in 2000. To address MDR-TB management in the context of the DOTS strategy, the World Health Organization and partners have been promoting an expanded treatment strategy called DOTS-Plus. However, standard definitions for MDR-TB patient registration and treatment outcomes do not exist. OBJECTIVE: To propose a standardized set of case registration groups and treatment outcome definitions for MDR-TB and procedures for conducting cohort analyses under the DOTS-Plus strategy. DESIGN: Using published definitions for drug-susceptible TB as a guide, a 2-year-long series of meetings, conferences, and correspondence was undertaken to review published literature and country-specific program experience, and to develop international agreement. RESULTS: Definitions were designed for MDR-TB patient categorization, smear and culture conversion, and treatment outcomes (cure, treatment completion, death, default, failure, transfer out). Standards for conducting outcome analyses were developed to ensure comparability between programs. CONCLUSION: Optimal management strategies for MDR-TB have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials. Standardized definitions and cohort analyses will facilitate assessment and comparison of program performance. These data will contribute to the evidence base to inform decision makers on approaches to MDR-TB control.	multi drug-resistant TB; definitions; treatment outcome; cohort analysis	RURAL SOUTH-AFRICA; CLINICAL OUTCOMES; SPUTUM MICROSCOPY; EMERGENCE; RIFAMPIN; THERAPY; HEALTH; CITY
10.1111_j.1440_1843.2005.00711.x	Levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and IL-1a in newly diagnosed and multidrug resistant tuberculosis	Background: The pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-1 alpha play key roles in host defence against tuberculosis (TB) but there is little knowledge of their levels in multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB). The aim of the present study was to investigate the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 alpha and their relationship with the levels of T helper (CD4'), T suppressor (CD8') and total lymphocytes (CD45(+)) in newly diagnosed TB (N-TB) and MDR-TB. Methodology: This study assessed 19N-TB patients (M/F: 17/2) and 11 MDR-TB patients (M/F: 10/1). Serum TNF-alpha and IL-1 alpha were assessed by ELISA. Lymphocyte expression of CD45, CD4, CD8, CD3, CD23, CD19 and CD95 were determined by flow cytometry. Results: The levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha, and CD4, CD4/CD8, CD45, CD19, CD23 and CD95 positive lymphocytes were lower in MDR-TB than in N-TB patients (P < 0.05). Statistically, (here was a positive correlation between TNF-alpha and IL-1 alpha (r = 0.92) for both MDR-TB and N-TB. For both groups, both TNF-alpha and IL-1 alpha. correlated with CD4' lymphocytes (r = 0.48). TNF-alpha and IL-1 alpha showed negative correlations with CD8(+) lymphocytes (r = -0.81, r = -0.73) (P < 0.01) in MDR-TB patients. Conclusion: The lower levels of cytokines and numbers of T helper lymphocytes in MDR-TB compared with N-TB implies that the immune profiles of the two groups are different, and may be important in the natural history of the disease.	interleukin-1 alpha; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; tuberculosis; tumour necrosis factor-alpha	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; INTERLEUKIN-1; MICE; DISEASE; CELLS; BETA
pub-1869	Patterns of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance among HIV-infected patients in Maputo, Mozambique, 2002-2003	SETTING: Two tuberculosis (TB) reference hospitals in Maputo, Mozambique. OBJECTIVES: To assess the pattern of TB drug resistance and its risk factors in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. DESIGN: Adult HIV-positive patients with TB diagnosed by culture of sputum or bronchial washing were enrolled during 2002-2003. Cultures of 111 patients were tested for rifampicin, isoniazid, streptomycin and ethambutol sensitivity. Chest X-ray, haemoglobin (Hb), total lymphocyte and CD4 counts were also performed. RESULTS: Overall resistance to any drugs was found in 18% and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in 9%. New cases of TB accounted for 62% of the studied group. Drug resistance in this subgroup was 13% compared with 26.3% in the previously treated subgroup, and MDR-TB was 5.8% vs. 15.8%. All patients presented Hb levels < 9 g/dl and total lymphocyte counts < 1200/mu l. CD4 counts were significantly low in the drug resistance subgroup, with levels mostly < 100/mu l. Cavities on X-ray were seen only in drug-sensitive patients. No risk factors for drug resistance were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Overall observed drug resistance was 18%, and MDR-TB 9%. Previously treated patients had high drug resistance (26.3%) and MDR-TB (15.8%).	tuberculosis; HIV; drug resistance; multidrug resistance; resistance pattern	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; MALARIA; KENYA; CAMEROON; YAOUNDE; COHORT; UGANDA; RISK
pub-1870	Isoniazid- and rifampin-resistant tuberculosis in San Diego County, California, United States, 1993-2002	SETTING: A local tuberculosis (TB) control program. OBJECTIVES: To measure trends isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RMP) resistance and identify associated factors. DESIGN: Retrospective review. RESULTS: Of 2883 isolates obtained from TB patients reported between 1993 and 2002,287 (10%) were resistant to INH, 11 (< 1%) were resistant to RMP, and 40 (1 %) were resistant to both (multidrug resistance [MDR]). There were no linear trends over time. Eighty-one per cent of patients with INH resistance and 85% with MDR were born outside the United States. Sixty-three per cent of patients with drug resistance and prior TB treatment were treated outside the US. INH resistance was associated with race/ethnicity and prior treatment, RMP resistance with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and MDR with non-US birth and prior treatment. Patients with INH- and RMP-susceptible or INH-resistant TB had higher percentages of treatment completion and sputum culture conversion than patients with RMP-resistant or MDR-TB. CONCLUSIONS: INH and RMP resistance remained stable between 1993 and 2002. Because most patients with drug resistance were infected or initially treated outside the US, future reductions in drug resistance will depend not only on local and national efforts, but also on the success of global interventions.	tuberculosis; isoniazid; rifampin; drug resistance	DIRECTLY OBSERVED THERAPY; DRUG
pub-1871	Management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Italy	SETTING: SMIRA (Italian Study on Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance) network, 46 major clinical units and 22 laboratories nationwide in Italy. OBJECTIVES: To determine the main features, adherence to WHO guidelines and the outcomes of multidrugresistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients enrolled from January 1995 to December 1999. DESIGN: Observational study, preceded by proficiency testing, according to WHO recommendations. Results were stratified by appropriate and inappropriate regimens (< three active drugs). Analysis of the outcomes was performed according to adequacy of treatment. Analysis of risk factors and factors predicting treatment outcomes was performed using univariate and multivariate analysis (level of significance P < 0.05). RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-seven MDR patients were diagnosed. The overall success rate was low (39%). Seventy per cent of cases were treated with at least three active drugs. Factors predicting treatment success were new MDR-TB cases (OR 3.45; 95%CI 1.22-9.78; P < 0.05) and treatment for >= 12 months (OR 5.03; 95 %CI 1.65-15. 3 1; P < 0.05). Immigration and HIV infection were the main risk factors among new MDR-TB cases. CONCLUSION: The best available treatment should be provided to all newly diagnosed MDR-TB patients, avoiding the use of poorly modified regimens. MDR-TB patients should be referred to highly speciallsed centres.	tuberculosis; MDR; management; Italy	ANTITUBERCULOSIS-DRUG-RESISTANCE; SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; COMMUNITY-BASED THERAPY; MDR-TB; SURVEILLANCE; EUROPE; PREVALENCE; INFECTION; COUNTRIES; OUTCOMES
pub-1872	Results of a national study on anti-mycobacterial drug resistance in El Salvador	SETTING: The DOTS strategy was introduced in El Salvador in 1997 and had become fully implemented countrywide by 2001. Previously, many deficiencies were identified in the management of patients with tuberculosis (TB). OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to first-line drugs. DESIGN: A national prospective survey was carried out in 2001 using the standardised World Health Organization/ International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease model. RESULTS: A total of 711 cultures were analysed (59% of total smear-positive cases); 611 were never treated and 100 were previously treated patients. The study showed resistance rates to isoniazid and rifampicin, either alone or combined (multidrug resistance, MDR), of 1.3%, 1.1% and 0.3%, respectively, In never treated patients, and 12%, 13% and 7%, respectively, in previously treated patients. CONCLUSION: The low rates of MDR-TB in El Salvador are puzzling, as out-patient DOTS was introduced only recently and fixed-dose combination tablets have not been used.	resistance study; El Salvador; tuberculosis; multidrug resistance	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; CLASSIFICATION; SUSCEPTIBILITY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; SURVEILLANCE; COMMUNITY; STRAINS
10.1016_j.jinf.2004.05.010	Drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Western Turkey: a retrospective study from 1100-bed teaching hospital	Objective. This study was planned to establish resistance profile of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in the West part of Turkey. Methods. The data were collected by searching records of tuberculosis (TB) division of microbiology laboratory in 1999 and 2001, retrospectively. Results. Susceptibilities of the all first-tine anti-TB drugs ratio were 76% in 1999 and 83.5% in 2001. Drug resistance of against isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP), ethambutol (EMB) and streptomycin (SM) were detected 11.9, 10.2, 11.92, 10.88% and 9.9, 9.27, 6.36, 8.56% for 1999 and 2001, respectively. Multidrug resistance (MDR)-TB rate was found on the high level. (6.6 and 5.8%). Conclusions. It was thought that resistance rates of A tuberculosis strains should be followed regularly and reasons for the high rates should be investigated. It was concluded that development of the national TB policy was the main issue for solving the present problems dealing with management of TB. Summary. A tuberculosis is one of the important emerging pathogens. Multidrug and polidrug strains have been increasing around the world. This study was planned to define drug resistance patterns for monitoring drug-resistant TB in Western Turkey. It is suggested that a close collaboration between academic researchers and TB system workers would be organized for further studies. &COPY; 2004 The British Infection Society.

10.1016_j.healthpol.2004.06.009	What lessons can de drawn from tuberculosis (TB) Control in China in the 1990s? An analysis from a health system perspective	"China has made a significant achievement in tackling the TB epidemic over the last decade, due largely to the implementation of directly-observed treatment strategy (DOT). The cure rate of TB cases reached more than 90% for registered TB patients. However, the case detection rate has, unfortunately, been very low (some 30%). Using available information, this paper identifies four main problems facing TB control in China, these are, low case finding, a substantial proportion of TB patients failing to complete standardised treatment, increased proportion of MDR TB patients, and lack of effective TB control among ""floating populations"". The paper also analyses the possible causes of these problems associated with socio-economic barriers in care seeking, ineffectiveness of TB services, particularly in poor areas, lack of co-operation between health facilities, and weakness of political and financial commitments of local governments to TB control. The paper ends with the discussion of opportunities and challenges facing TB control and makes recommendations for further actions and research. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

pub-1875	Tuberculosis bacteriology - priorities and indications in high prevalence countries: position of the technical staff of the Tuberculosis Division of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease	Smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) remains the first priority for national tuberculosis programmes (NTPs) in high-prevalence countries. No other established technique offers the same advantages of accuracy, speed, appropriateness and accessibility. Its sensitivity may be reduced in HIV-positive cases or because of technical deficiencies, and it lacks specificity for viable bacilli in follow-up examinations. Its main problem is that it is tedious, necessitating an effective external quality assessment (EQA) system following international guidelines. Operational research is needed to optimise the staining technique, to define the place of sputum concentration and fluorescence microscopy, to challenge difficult and obsolete strategies and to streamline procedures. Culture is much more difficult to set up and is usually impossible to decentralise. Because of its lower yield and higher costs, Its efficiency for case detection in NTPs will lag well behind that in industrialised countries. The technique should only be used as a preliminary to drug susceptibility testing (DST). DST should not be developed to the detriment of the AFB microscopy network and its EQA. It should be used mainly for monitoring drug resistance. Continuous monitoring of resistance in a representative sample of isolates from first-line failure and relapse cases may be more efficient and more accurate than periodic surveys among new cases, and can be used to identify MDR-TB, whose treatment should be standardised, because of considerable risk of error in the laboratory. A specialist service offering molecular techniques may be useful for exceptional cases, but it has no place in the routine work of NTPs.	tuberculosis; microscopy; culture; quality assurance; drug resistance surveillance	ACID-FAST BACILLI; DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; SPUTUM SMEAR MICROSCOPY; BACTEC MGIT 960; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; RIFAMPICIN RESISTANCE; TUBERCLE-BACILLI; KARONGA DISTRICT
pub-1876	Retreatment management strategies when first-line tuberculosis therapy fails	SETTING: Public ambulatory centers in northern Lima, Peru. OBJECTIVE: To compare two retreatment strategies in Category I failures. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of Category I failures enrolled between February 1997 and October 2001. Strategy A was a nationwide approach, applying a Category 11 regimen; if that regimen failed, a standardized regimen including second-line drugs was used. Strategy B was a pilot protocol designed to diagnose and treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB); this strategy included drug susceptibility testing (DST) and eliminated the Category H regimen. RESULTS: Of 125 patients that Category I failed to cure, 73 entered Strategy A and 52 entered Strategy B. Almost 90% of those with DST results had MDR-TB. Strategy B was three times more likely than Strategy A to cure patients (79% vs. 38%, RR = 2.9, 95%CI 1.7-5.1) and five times more likely to cure patients than the Category 11 regimen alone (79% vs. 15%, RR 5.2, 95%CI 3.09.2). Strategy B also significantly reduced delays to MDR-TB diagnosis and to the initiation of MDR-TB therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Under program conditions, a retreatment strategy based on DST and eliminating the Category II regimen can improve clinical outcomes among Category I treatment failures found to have active, infectious MDR-TB.	treatment failure; Category I regimen; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; Category II; DOTS-Plus	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; DRUG-RESISTANCE; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; MDR-TB; REGIMEN; PERU
10.1128_JCM.43.4.1612_1616.2005	Rapid detection of ofloxacin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis by two low-cost colorimetric methods: Resazurin and nitrate reductase assays	We have evaluated the performance of two rapid, low-cost methods for the detection of ofloxacin (OFX) resistance with 95 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from countries with high multidrug-resistant tuberculosis endemicity. Results obtained by nitrate reductase and resazurin assays showed 100% agreement with those of the proportion method on 7H11 agar using 2 mu g of OFX/ml. We confirmed the resistance of all isolates found to be resistant to OFX by the Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tube system, and complete agreement among all methods was observed.

10.1016_j.athoracsur.2004.09.007	Current surgical intervention for pulmonary tuberculosis	Background. Surgery for pulmonary tuberculosis now plays a role in facing the emergence of complicated and multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), and it still remains a challenge for thoracic surgeons. We report on our 16 years of experience with lung resection for pulmonary tuberculosis. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed the surgical results of 35 patients (23 males and 12 females: mean age, 47.8 years) who underwent therapeutic surgical resection for pulmonary tuberculosis from 1988 to 2003. Results. Indications for surgery were MDR-TB in 26 patients, hemoptysis in 7, destroyed lung in 1, and drug allergy in 1. Thirty patients (85.7%) had fibrocavitary lesions seen radiologically, and 16 (61.5%) MDR-TB patients showed sputum-positive preoperatively. Operative procedures included 22 lobectomies, 7 pneumonectomies, 5 lobectomy plus segmentectomy procedures, and 1 segmentectomy. There was one operation-related death (2.9%) and 5 major postoperative complications (14.3%). Overall, 32 of 35 (91.4%) patients including 23 of 26 (88.5%) of the MDR-TB patients remained free of TB following surgery. Preoperative comorbidity, Aspergillus coinfection, operation time, transfusion, and male were the factors shown to be predictive of an unfavorable outcome. Conclusions. Surgery remains a crucial adjunct to medical therapy for the treatment of MDR-TB and medical failure lesions. Treatment success was obtained in cases with MDR-TB with few and incomplete sensitive drugs, and the early morbidity and mortality were acceptable in the current series. Proper selection of the patients and early decision for surgical intervention can achieve a high success rate and the salvage of lung parenchyma in this difficult group of patients.

10.1099_jmm.0.45635_0	Drug-sensitivity profile of clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates - a retrospective study from a chest-disease institute in India	Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major public-health problem, because treatment is complicated and patients remain infectious for months or years, despite receiving the best available therapy. To gain better understanding of MDR-TB, a retrospective study was initiated to determine the level of drug resistance among patients in a chest-disease institute in India. Two hundred and sixty-three isolates from treatment-failure pulmonary tuberculosis patients (20 - 70 years) were studied. Drug-sensitivity testing was performed by the modified-proportion method. First- and second-line drugs, along with two quinolone drugs (ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin), were tested. Patients included in this study did not improve with therapy; however, 151 isolates (57.5 %) were susceptible to all four first-line antituberculosis drugs. This study reports low resistance to fluoroquinolones among the strains present in these patients.		RESISTANCE
10.1016_j.pep.2004.06.040	DAHP synthase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv: cloning, expression, and purification of functional enzyme	"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains the leading cause of mortality due to a bacterial pathogen. According to the 2004 Global TB Control Report of the World Health Organization, there are 300,000 new cases per year of multidrug resistant strains (MDR-TB), defined as resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin, and 79% of MDR-TB cases are now ""super strains,"" resistant to at least three of the four main drugs used to treat TB. Thus there is a need for the development of effective new agents to treat TB. The shikimate pathway is an attractive target for the development of antimycobacterial agents because it has been shown to be essential for the viability of M. tuberculosis, but absent from mammals. The M. tuberculosis aroG-encoded 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (mtDAHPS) catalyzes the first committed step in this pathway. Here we describe the PCR amplification, cloning, and sequencing of aroG structural gene from M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The expression of recombinant mtDAHPS protein in the soluble form was obtained in Escherichia coli Rosetta-gami (DE3) host cells without IPTG induction. An approximately threefold purification protocol yielded homogeneous enzyme with a specific activity value of 0.47 U mg(-1) under the experimental conditions used. Gel filtration chromatography results demonstrate that recombinant mtDAHPS is a pentamer in solution. The availability of homogeneous mtDAHPS will allow structural and kinetics studies to be performed aiming at antitubercular agents development. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

10.1007_s10096_004_1268_4	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Russia: clinical characteristics, analysis of second-line drug resistance and development of standardized therapy	The aim of the study presented here was to identify patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) in the Samara region of Russia and to analyze the susceptibility of their isolates to second-line drugs in order to develop an empirical, standard, second-line treatment regimen. Treatment of MDRTB can be individualized based on in vitro laboratory analysis or standardized. In the latter case there is still a need to ascertain local second-line drug-resistance patterns. Described here are the clinical characteristics of 251 MDRTB patients identified in the study and the second-line drug susceptibility of 69 MDRTB isolates obtained from them. Antimicrobial resistance to the following agents was detected in the isolates: rifabutin (88.2%), streptomycin (42.8%), amikacin (7.2%), doxycycline (7.4%), ciprofloxacin (4.3%), clofazimine (2.9%), cycloserine (7.4%), and prothionamide (1.5%). The results of the study indicate it is possible to develop a standard, effective, clinical treatment regimen using ethambutol, pyrazinamide, prothionamide, a fluoroquinolone and amikacin.

10.1038_sj.gt.3302418	Immunotherapy with plasmid DNA encoding mycobacterial hsp65 in association with chemotherapy is a more rapid and efficient form of treatment for tuberculosis in mice	Tuberculosis ( TB) remains a threat for public health, killing around 3 million people a year. Despite the fact that most cases can be cured with antibiotics, the treatment is long and patients relapse if chemotherapy is not continued for at least 6 months. Thus, a better characterization of the working principles of the immune system in TB and identification of new immunotherapeutic products for the development of shorter regimens of treatment are essential to achieve an effective management of this disease. In the present work, we demonstrate that immunotherapy with a plasmid DNA encoding the Mycobacterium leprae 65 kDa heat-shock protein (hsp65) in order to boost the efficiency of the immune system, is a valuable adjunct to antibacterial chemotherapy to shorten the duration of treatment, improve the treatment of latent TB infection and be effective against multidrug-resistant bacilli (MDR-TB). We also showed that the use of DNA-hsp65 alone or in combination with other drugs influence the pathway of the immune response or other types of inflammatory responses and should augment our ability to alter the course of immune response/inflammation as needed, evidencing an important target for immunization or drug intervention.

pub-1883	Treatment outcome of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among Vietnamese immigrants	OBJECTIVE: To review the outcome for MDR-TB treatment among potential migrants from Vietnam. SETTING: All cases of documented MDR-TB treated by the International Organization of Migration (IOM) in Vietnam from 1989 to 2000 were reviewed. METHODS: MDR-TB was defined as isoniazid- and rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. All cases of TB treated by the IOM and recorded in the computerised database were reviewed to identify MDR-TB cases. Demographics, chest radiograph results, drug resistance, drug use and dosage, duration of treatment, and outcome were analysed. RESULTS: Forty-four cases of MDR-TB were identified. Treatment consisted of ambulatory directly observed treatment with an 8-drug protocol: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, capreomycin, ethionamide, ofloxacin and cycloserine. This initial protocol was modified due to drug availability or drug intolerance. Patients were treated with a median of 8 drugs (range 6-12). Mean duration of treatment for MDR-TB was 23.0 (SD +/- 11.4) months. Thirty-eight (86%) patients were cured and emigrated, one failed treatment (2%), three were lost to follow-up (7%) and two died (4%). CONCLUSION: Treatment for MDR-TB provided by the IOM was effective in preparing a low-income population for migration.	multidrug resistant tuberculosis; treatment outcome; migration	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; THERAPY; CHEMOTHERAPY; RIFAMPIN; PERU
pub-1884	High prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis, Republic of Lithuania, 2002	BACKGROUND: Nations of the former Soviet Union have the world's highest reported levels of resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs. We conducted the first national survey of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in the Republic of Lithuania. METHODS: We tested Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from all incident culture-positive pulmonary TB patients registered in 2002. New patients were those treated for <1 month with any first-line anti-tuberculosis drug (isoniazid [INH], rifampin [RMP], ethambutol, or streptomycin); previously treated patients were those treated for greater than or equal to1 month. RESULTS: Of 1163 isolates, 475 (41%) were resistant to at least one first-line drug, and 263 (23%) were resistant to at least INH and RMP (MDR); this included 76/818 (9.3%) from new patients and 187/345 (54%) from previously treated patients. Of 52 MDR isolates randomly selected for extended testing at an international reference laboratory, 2 7 (51%, 95 % CI 38-66) had resistance to pyrazinamide, 21 (40%, 95% CI 27-55) to kanamycin, and 9 (17%, 95% CI 8-30) to ofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MDR-TB in Lithuania is among the world's highest. Among MDR-TB isolates, aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone resistance were common. To combat drug-resistant TB, Lithuania has implemented the WHO global TB control strategy (DOTS), and is developing an MDR-TB treatment program (DOTS-Plus).	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; prevalence; Europe; Lithuania	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; FLUOROQUINOLONES; IMPACT
pub-1885	Drug resistance profiles of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates: five years' experience and insight into treatment strategies for MDR-TB in Lima, Peru	SETTING: Lima, Peru. OBJECTIVE: To describe drug resistance profiles of TB isolates from patients at risk for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), and to consider the implications of these findings for treatment. DESIGN: Descriptive study of drug susceptibility testing (DST) results for TB isolates from 1680 patients referred for suspicion of MDR-TB between 1996 and 2001. RESULTS: Of 1680 isolates tested, 1144 (68%) were resistant to at least one anti-tuberculosis drug and 926 (55%) were MDR-TB strains. Of 926 MDR isolates, 50 (5%) were resistant to INH and RMP alone, while 367 (40%) were resistant to at least five first-line drugs. We identified 146 unique drug resistance profiles, the most common of which accounted for 11% of drug-resistant isolates. The annual prevalence of isolates with resistance to at least five first-line drugs rose significantly during the study period, from 29% to 37% (P = 0.00086). CONCLUSIONS: This is a group of patients with TB disease among whom the prevalence of a broad spectrum of often highly drug-resistant strains appears to be increasing over time. A single standardized retreatment regimen may be inadequate to cure most patients. Capacity for drug sensitivity testing is essential for development of multiple standardized retreatment or individualized treatment regimens and epidemiological surveillance for planning.

pub-1886	Second-line drug susceptibilities of Thai multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates	The emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is increasing and is exacerbated by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic. The standard short-course regimen used for the treatment of tuberculosis is likely to be ineffective against MDR-TB, leading to the need for second-line drugs. In such situations, drug susceptibility testing (DST) is necessary to select an appropriate treatment regimen. In this study, DST of 99 MDR-TB strains isolated in Thailand was performed using a drug-impregnated disc method. The results showed that 94.95% of the strains were susceptible to amikacin and kanamycin, 90.91% to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, 85.86% to para-aminosalicylic acid, and 78.79% to ethionamide.

pub-1887	The resistance to major antituberculous drugs of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated from the respiratory system specimens of tuberculosis patients in Duzce, Turkey	Though generally curable, tuberculosis (TB) is becoming increasingly resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB is a consequence of monotherapy, insufficient drug therapy and national TB control programs. The present study was designed to reveal the resistance to major antimicrobial drugs (isoniazid [INH], streptomycin [SM], ethambutol [EMB], and rifampicin [RIF]) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from the respiratory specimens of TB patients in Duzce, Turkey. A total of 62 TB patients (46 male, 16 female; age: 17-75 mean: 42 +/- 15.9) were included in the study; 52 (83.8%) were new cases and susceptible to all anti-TB drugs, while 10 (16.2%) were previously treated cases. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed by the proportion method in Lowenstein-Jensen medium. Fifty-two of the 62 (83.8%) isolated M. tuberculosis strains were found to be susceptible to all drugs, and 7 (11.3%), 5 (8%), and 3 (4.8%) were resistant to SM, INH, and RIF, respectively; 3 (4.8%) were MDR. There were no EMB-resistant strains. The results of this study. show the presence of drug-resistant and MDR strains of TB at Duzce in the northwest part of Turkey.		TREATMENT OUTCOMES; TB
10.1136_thx.2004.026922	Rates of drug resistance and risk factor analysis in civilian and prison patients with tuberculosis in Samara Region, Russia	Background: Tuberculosis (TB) and HIV rates continue to escalate in Russia, but true rates for drug resistance, especially multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB), are unknown. A study was conducted with the aims of identifying first line drug resistance, both in the civilian and prison sectors, for new and previously treated cases; and risk factors for the development of drug resistance. Methods: A cross sectional survey was undertaken of 600 patients (309 civilians, 291 prisoners) with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB over a 1 year period during 2001-2 in Samara Oblast, Russia. Results: The prevalence of isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide resistance in new TB cases ( civilian and prison patients) was 38.0%, 25.2%, 34.6%, 14.7%, and 7.2%, respectively. The prevalence of MDR TB was 22.7%, 19.8%, and 37.3% in all new cases, new civilian cases, and new prison cases, respectively, with an overall prevalence of 45.5% and 55.3% in previously treated cases. Factors associated with resistance included previous TB treatment for more than 4 weeks, smoking (for isoniazid resistance), the presence of cavitations on the chest radiograph, and imprisonment. HIV was not associated with resistance in all patients. The rates of resistance were significantly higher in prisoners, with rate ratios (RR) of 1.9 (95% CI 1.1 to 3.2) for MDR TB, 1.9 (95% CI 1.1 to 3.2) for rifampicin, and 1.6 (95% CI 1.0 to 2.6) for isoniazid. Conclusions: Rates of first line drug resistance are high, particularly in prisoners and previously treated cases. TB control programmes should initially focus on standardised treatment to maximise cure, combined with measures to reduce institutional TB spread ( particularly in prisons) coupled with early diagnosis of MDR TB to reduce the spread and development of resistance.

pub-1889	Clinical outcome of individualised treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Latvia: a retrospective cohort study	Background Latvia has one of the highest rates of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB). Our aim was to assess treatment outcomes for the first full cohort of MDRTB patients treated under Latvia's DOTS-Plus strategy following WHO guidelines. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all civilian patients who began treatment with individualised treatment regimens for pulmonary MDRTB in Latvia between Jan 1, and Dec 31, 2000. We applied treatment outcome definitions for MDRTB, developed by an international. expert consensus group, and assessed treatment effectiveness and risk factors associated with poor outcome. Findings Of the 204 patients assessed, 55 (27%) had been newly diagnosed with MDRTB, and 149 (73%) had earlier been treated with first-line or second-line drugs for this disease. Assessment of treatment outcomes showed that 135 (66%) patients were cured or completed therapy, 14 (7%) died, 26 (13%) defaulted, and treatment failed in 29 (14%). Of the 178 adherent patients, 135 (76%) achieved cure or treatment completion. In a multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model of these patients, independent predictors of poor outcome (death and treatment failure) included having previously received treatment for MDRTB (hazard ratio 5.7, 95% CI 1.9-16.6), the use of five or fewer drugs for 3 months or more (3.2, 1.1-9.6), resistance to ofloxacin (2.6, 1.2-5.4), and body-mass index less than 18.5 at start of treatment (2.3, 1.1-4.9). Interpretation The DOTS-Plus strategy of identifying and treating patients with MDRTB can be effectively implemented on a nationwide scale in a setting of limited resources.

10.1093_bmb_ldh047	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB): epidemiology, prevention and treatment	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is an increasing global problem, with most cases arising from a mixture of physician error and patient non-compliance during treatment of susceptible TB. The extent and burden of MDR-TB varies significantly from country to country and region to region. As with TB itself, the overwhelming burden of MDR-TB is in high-burden resource-poor countries. The diagnosis depends on confirming the drug susceptibility pattern of isolated organisms, which is often only possible in resource-rich settings. There should be a strong suspicion of drug resistance, including MDR-TB, in persons with a history of prior treatment or in treatment failure cases. Treatment in developed countries is expensive and involves an individualized regimen based on drug susceptibility data and use of reserve drugs. In resource-poor settings a WHO retreatment regimen may be used, but increasingly the move is to a directly observed treatment based 'DOTS-plus' regimen in a supported national TB programme. However, even where such treatment is given, the outcome for patients is significantly worse than that for fully susceptible TB and has a much higher cost.

pub-1891	Analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from treatment failure patients living in East Timor	SETTING: In the first 2 years of the East Timor National TB Control Programme, 7960 new patients were treated (2RHZE/6HE) and 224 received a retreatment regimen (2SRHZE/IRHZE/4R(3)H(3)Z(3)E(3)). OBJECTIVE: To determine the nature and extent of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in treatment failure cases in East Timor. METHODS: Sputum specimens from retreatment failure cases were processed and inoculated into a BACTEC MGIT960 tube and onto Lowenstein-Jensen media. Isolates were identified by Ziehl-Neelsen staining, hybridisation with nucleic acid probes and biochemical investigations. Susceptibility testing was performed using the radiometric proportion method. Pyrazinamide testing was performed using the Wayne indirect method. RESULTS: Eighteen patients failed retreatment (0.7% of new cases) and 14 were available for analysis. Mycobactetium tuberculosis was cultured from all specimens, despite considerable transport delays. Nine (64.3%) had multiple drug resistance (MDR-TB) and four (28.6%) had other drug resistance. All MDR-TB isolates were susceptible to amikacin, capreomycin and ethionamide, with most also susceptible to ciprofloxacin and para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS). CONCLUSIONS: An excellent TB control programme has been established in East Timor. If funds are available, East Timor provides an ideal setting for a small-scale DOTS-Plus programme to treat prevalent cases of MDR-TB, and this study could inform the second-line drug regimen.	tuberculosis; East Timor; multidrug resistance; treatment failure; VNTR	DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; RETREATMENT; OUTCOMES
10.1057_palgrave.jphp_3200014	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in India: An attempt to link biosocial determinants	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has emerged as a possible threat to global tuberculosis control efforts in recent years. It is a challenge not only from a public health point of view but also in the context of global economy, especially in the absence of treatment for MDR-TB at national-level programs in developing countries. Biological accounts are insufficient to understand the emergence and dynamics of drug resistance. This article focuses essentially on the need for a holistic perspective, linking biosocial determinants that would probably lead to better insights into MDR-TB control strategies.	drug resistance; medical; behavioral; socio-cultural; primary; acquired	PRIMARY-HEALTH-CARE; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; PUBLIC-HEALTH; DOTS-PLUS; PRACTITIONERS; PREVENTION; INFECTION; LESSONS; IMPACT
10.1016_j.tube.2004.09.010	Cell-mediated immune responses in children towards secreted proteins of Mycobacterium bovis BCG	Background: There is a need to develop an improved anti-TB vaccine for adequate control and elimination of tuberculosis, to control the spread of MDR-TB and TB/HIV co-infection. Studies in children have indicated that BCG vaccination has certain beneficial effects, especially against miliary TB and TB meningitis, but needs to be improved for protection against pulmonary tuberculosis. Objective: The aim of the present study was to identify the immunogenic proteins in the culture filtrate (CF) of Mycobacterium bovis BCG by studying the effector mechanism of protection in children, which may help in the formulation of an effective vaccine against tuberculosis. Materials and methods: Lymphoproliferative responses (LTT) and the levels of IL-2 and IFN-gamma (Th1 cytokines) released into the culture supernatants were estimated (by ELISA) in short-term cultures of PBMC of BCG vaccinated (n = 25) and unvaccinated (n = 15) children and children with tuberculosis (n = 15) against 10 different fractions of CF (mot. wt greater than or equal to, 90- < 14 kDa). Results: The mean stimulation indices (SI) in LTT against all the (10) fractions in vaccinated children were high when compared to the unvaccinated and diseased groups; however, of the 10 fractions, F3, F4, F6, F8 and F9 elicited significantly higher Sls than the other fractions (p<0.05). In the vaccinated children, the SI (5.58+/-1.57), levels of IL-2 (381.66+/-16.40pg/ml) and IFN-gamma (732+/-62.36pg/ml) in the cultures stimulated by fraction 8 (34-30kDa) were significantly higher (p<0.001), than responses to the other fractions and also to those of other groups of children. Conclusion: Thus, the peptides within the cluster 34-30kDa appear to be promising vaccine candidates by virtue of their immunodominant nature specifically priming Th1 cells in normal, BCG-vaccinated children.

10.1378_chest.126.6.1770	Use of therapeutic drug monitoring for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients	Study objectives: Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is the process of obtaining the serum concentration of a medication and modifying the dose based on the results. Little is known about the application of TDM in the treatment of patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) in clinical practice. This study characterized how TDM was applied in the management of MDR TB patients, and examined the clinical indications for ordering TDM, the process for obtaining drug concentrations, and the clinician response to the drug concentrations. Design: In a retrospective study, we compared the clinical and demographic characteristics of MDR TB patients who received TDM with those who did not. The clinical application of TDM also was described in patients who received TDM. Setting: A municipal TB control program. Patients or participants: Patients in whom TB was diagnosed that was caused by an isolate resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, and who received treatment for TB in one of the health department chest clinics between July 1, 1993, and August 31, 1997, were studied. Results: Forty-nine patients receiving TDM had a longer time to culture conversion and treatment duration, more pulmonary TB in combination with an extrapulmonary site, drug resistance, and visits to the health department clinics (p < 0.05) than the 60 patients without TDM. Of the 49 patients who had initial TDM, 73.5% of them had the reason for being tested specified. A total of 85.7% of initial TDM results were collected at the appropriate time of blood sampling. Clinician response to TDM results varied with the drug that was being tested. Conclusions: The use of TDM depended largely on the patient's clinical presentation. Site-specific guidelines on the use of TDM for managing TB patients may maximize the benefit of TDM.	drug monitoring; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	FASTING CONDITIONS; PHARMACOKINETICS; REGIMENS; ANTACIDS; RIFAMPIN; OUTCOMES; ISSUES; FOOD
10.1007_s15010_004_3127_8	Drug-resistant tuberculosis in HIV-infected persons: Italy 1999-2000	Background: Patients with HIV infection may be a valuable target for assessing the impact of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). Patients and Methods: An observational, prospective study was conducted in 96 infectious disease hospital units in Italy during 1999-2000. A total of 140 HIV-infected patients with diagnosis of TB and with an isolate tested for drug susceptibility entered the analysis. Drug resistance (DR) was defined as resistance to either isoniazid (INN) or rifampin (RIF), while multidrug resistance (MDR) was defined as resistance to INH and RIF. Results: A total of 117 (83.6%) episodes of TB were classified as new cases and 23 (16.4%) as previously treated cases. Prevalence of resistance to INH or RIF was 12.8% and 4.3% among new cases, and 17.4% and 26.1% among previously treated cases, respectively. Prevalence rates of DR and MDR were 14.5% and 2.6% among new cases and 30.4% and 12.5% among previously treated cases, respectively. No statistically significant risk factors associated with DR or MDR TB emerged in this analysis. Conclusion: High prevalence rates of DR and MDR are present among HIV-infected TB patients in Italy, in particular among previously treated cases.		ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS; SURVEILLANCE
pub-1896	Adverse events in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: results from the DOTS-Plus initiative	Adverse events associated with second-line drugs have been mentioned as obstacles in the management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Data on adverse events were collected from five DOTS-Plus sites in Estonia, Latvia, Peru (Lima), the Philippines (Manila) and the Russian Federation (Tomsk Oblast). The results show that among 818 patients enrolled on MDR-TB treatment only 2% of patients stopped treatment, but 30% required removal of the suspected drug(s) from the regimen due to adverse events. The study shows that adverse events are manageable in the treatment of MDR-TB in resource-limited settings provided that standard management strategies are applied.

pub-1897	Relationship between self reporting of past history of anti-tuberculosis treatment and radiographic findings in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: A referral hospital for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how self-reporting of past exposure to anti-tuberculosis therapy in MDR-TB patients relates to their chest radiographs. RESULTS: Chest radiographs of 406 patients with bacteriologically confirmed NMR-TB who were admitted to a tertiary referral hospital during 1998-2001 were reviewed. Of 245 patients with chronic radiographic changes, 91% SUMMARY reported previous anti-tuberculosis treatment, while of 161 patients with acute radiographic changes, 70% reported no previous history of TB treatment. CONCLUSION: Self-reporting by patients of previous anti-tuberculosis treatment relates to the duration of disease assessed radiologically, and is much more reliable than previously postulated.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; self reporting; past history of TB; chest radiograph; South Africa	
10.1128_JCM.42.10.4432_4437.2004	Microscopic observation drug susceptibility assay, a rapid, reliable diagnostic test for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis suitable for use in resource-poor settings	There is an urgent need for new tools to improve our ability to diagnose tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in resource-poor settings. In a retrospective analysis undertaken in a region with a high incidence of TB, we evaluated the performance of the microscopic observation drug susceptibility assay (MODS), a novel assay developed in Peru which uses an inverted light microscope and culture in Middlebrook 7H9 broth to detect mycobacterial growth. MODS detected 94.0% of 1,908 positive sputum cultures, whereas Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) culture detected only 86.9% (P < 0.001). The median time to culture positivity was 8 days (compared to 16 days for the same 208 samples by LJ culture; P < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). The results obtained by direct susceptibility testing using MODS demonstrated excellent concordance for isoniazid and rifampin and the detection of multidrug resistance with those obtained by indirect colorimetric methods: the microplate Alamar Blue assay (MABA) and the tetrazolium microplate assay (TEMA) (agreement, 95, 98, and 94%; kappa values, 0.8, 0.7, and 0.7, respectively). The concordance of the susceptibility testing results for ethambutol and streptomycin was poor. MODS is a novel assay which can detect the organisms responsible for TB and MDR-TB directly from sputum inexpensively, rapidly, and effectively. A comprehensive prospective evaluation of MODS is under way in Peru, and independent validation in nonresearch laboratories should be undertaken at the earliest opportunity.

10.1038_nm1102	Modeling the emergence of the 'hot zones': tuberculosis and the amplification dynamics of drug resistance	`Hot zones' are areas that have >5% prevalence (or incidence) of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB). We present a new mathematical model (the amplifier model) that tracks the emergence and evolution of multiple (pre-MDR, MDR and post-MDR) strains of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We reconstruct possible evolutionary trajectories that generated hot zones over the past three decades, and identify the key causal factors. Results are consistent with recently reported World Health Organization (WHO) data. Our analyses yield three important insights. First, paradoxically we found that areas with programs that successfully reduced wild-type pansensitive strains often evolved into hot zones. Second, some hot zones emerged even when MDR strains were substantially less fit (and thus less transmissible) than wild-type pansensitive strains. Third, levels of MDR are driven by case-finding rates, cure rates and amplification probabilities. To effectively control MDRTB in the hot zones, it is essential that the WHO specify a goal for minimizing the amplification probability.

pub-1900	The Beijing genotype is emerging among multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains from Germany	SETTING: Germany, 1995 to 2001. OBJECTIVE: To determine the genetic relationship of 451 multi drug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains from Germany and to identify strains of the Beijing genotype. DESIGN: All strains were analysed using IS6110 fingerprinting and a cluster analysis was performed. Clustering of isolates was used as a measure for recent transmission. RESULTS: Two hundred and fourteen of 433 strains (49.4%) with more than four IS6110 copies formed 46 fingerprint clusters comprising two to 32 patients. Transmission links based on classical epidemiological data could be established for 39 cases (18.2%) and in 14 clusters (30.4%), and included three cases of exogenous reinfection with MDR strains. One hundred and seventy-five strains (38.8%) were of the Beijing genotype with an increasing annual proportion from 19.2% in 1995 to 58.3% in 2001. About 70% of these patients had an indication of foreign birth, mainly the former Soviet Union. CONCLUSION: Transmission of MDR strains seems robe contributing to the spread of MDR-TB in Germany, and exogenous reinfection with MDR strains must be considered as a possible cause of treatment failure. A high proportion of these MDR strains is probably carried over from the former Soviet Union, and strains of the Beijing genotype represent an increasing cause of MDR-TB in Germany.

10.1111_j.1440_1711.2004.01245.x	Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces high production of nitric oxide in coordination with production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha in patients with fresh active tuberculosis but not in MDR tuberculosis	Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an intracellular pathogen that readily survives and replicates in human macrophages. Host cells have developed various mycobactericidal and immunoregulatory mechanisms, such as the production of nitric oxide and inflammatory cytokines to control intracellular replication of M. tuberculosis. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is transcriptionally under the control of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. IL-12 provides a crucial link between activated mononuclear phagocytes and T cells by regulating the production of IFN-gamma. In this study, we investigated the production of nitric oxide (NO), TNF-alpha and IL-12 by the peripheral blood monocytes (PB Mn) of patients suffering from multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The cells were infected with M. tuberculosis and stimulated with IFN-gamma or activated with mycobacterial subcellular components. The results were compared with those from cases of newly diagnosed TB and healthy controls. Nitric oxide production was significantly depressed in PB Mn from MDR-TB patients. Infected monocytes from newly diagnosed TB patients produced significantly higher levels of NO as compared to those from MDR-TB patients or normal controls. The subcellular fraction of M. tuberculosis-like whole cell lysate (WCL), culture filtrate protein (CFP) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) induced higher concentrations of NO release in PB Mn from newly diagnosed TB patients as compared to those from MDR-TB patients. Cell culture supernatant from PB Mn assayed at 48 h after infection or stimulation demonstrated significantly depressed release of TNF-alpha. and IL-12 from MDR-TB cases as compared to the fresh cases. We observed a definite correlation between nitric oxide release and TNF-a production, irrespective of low or high production in MDR-TB or fresh cases, respectively. The present data suggest that peripheral blood monocytes of MDR-TB patients typically show signs of immunosuppression. Whether such immunodepression is the cause or the effect of MDR-TB merits further investigation.

pub-1902	Costs of patients hospitalized for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: From 1993 through 1998, 1846 cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were reported in the United States. Costs associated with MDR-TB are likely to be much higher than for drug-susceptible tuberculosis due to longer hospitalization, longer treatment with more expensive and toxic medications, greater productivity losses, and higher mortality. OBJECTIVE: To measure the societal costs of patients hospitalized for MDR-TB. DESIGN: We detailed in-patient costs for 13 multidrug-resistant patients enrolled in a national study. We estimated costs for physician care, out-patient treatment, and productivity losses for survivors and for deceased patients. RESULTS: In-patient costs averaged US$25 853 per person and $1036 per person-day of hospitalization. Outpatient costs per person ranged from $5744 to $41 821 (average $19 028, or $44 a day). Direct medical costs averaged $44 881; indirect costs for those who survived averaged $32 964, and indirect costs for those who died averaged $686 381 per person. Total costs per person ranged from $28 217 to $181 492 (average $89 594) for those who survived, and from $509 490 to $1278 066 (average $717 555) for those who died. CONCLUSION: The societal costs of MDR-TB varied, mostly because of length of therapy (including in-patient), and deaths during treatment.	multiple drug resistance; costs and cost analysis; cost of illness; tuberculosis	
pub-1903	Isolation of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis strains in patients from private and public health care facilities in Nairobi, Kenya	SETTING: Healthcare facilities in Nairobi, Kenya. OBJECTIVE: To document the presence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains in patients from Nairobi between September 1999 and October 2001. DESIGN: Descriptive study. RESULTS: Of the 983 referred patients who submitted sputum for culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST), 59% were males. Two hundred and nine (21.3%) patients had a positive culture, of whom 15.2% had a request for DST against isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin and ethambutol. Of these, 65 (43.6%) had an isolate resistant to one or more drugs, while 17 (11.4%) had MDR-TB. Ten (59.0%) cases were referred from public health care facilities while seven (41%) were from the private sector. Sixteen isolates were resistant to all four drugs. All MDR-TB cases but one were from Nairobi. CONCLUSION: The emergence of MDR-TB in Nairobi is a cause for concern. An outbreak would be catastrophic, creating not only increased morbidity and mortality but also a tremendous strain on already limited health care resources. Lack of policies for the treatment and management of MDR-TB and the unavailability of appropriate diagnostic facilities may increase its spread. Efforts to prevent outbreaks of MDR-TB should be emphasised.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; Nairobi; Kenya	ANTITUBERCULOSIS-DRUG-RESISTANCE; HIV-INFECTION; SURVEILLANCE
pub-1904	Direct rapid diagnosis of rifampicin-resistant M-tuberculosis infection in clinical samples by line probe assay (INNO LiPA Rif-TB)	"M. tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and Multi Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is associated with a high case-fatality rate. Rapid identification of resistant strains is crucial to institute prompt appropriate therapy, and prevent the development of further resistance and spreading of MDR strains. The INNO-LiPA Rif.TB is a commercial reverse hybridisation line probe assail designed for rapid detection of rpoB gene mutations in clinical isolates. We applied this test directly to 44 smear-positive and 45 smear-negative clinical specimens collected from patients suspected of active TB. The capability of this technique to correctly identify local MDR-TB strains was tested on 50 MDR strains isolated in Italy. Results of the test were compared to conventional antibiogram performed on isolated strains. The concordance rate of the LiPA test results on clinical specimens with those obtained with ""in vitro"" sensitivity was 100%. These results show that the LiPA test can be useful in rapid detection and prompt management of tuberculosis when MDR disease is suspected."	rifampicin resistance; M. tuberculosis; LiPA assay	NEW-YORK-CITY; RPOB MUTATIONS; ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; HYBRIDIZATION ASSAY; STRAINS; GENE; PREVALENCE; COUNTRIES; SUSCEPTIBILITY
10.1021_jm030479g	Novel pyridazino[4,3-b]indoles with dual inhibitory activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and monoamine oxidase	Tuberculosis is one of the most common infectious diseases known to man. About 37% of the world's population (about 1.86 billion people) are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. According to the World Health Organization, every year approximately 8 million people develop active tuberculosis and almost 2 million of those die from the disease. The incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is increasing. The present drug regimen for treating tuberculosis has been in existence for 30 years. New drugs that will shorten total treatment duration, improve the treatment of MDR-TB, and address latent tuberculosis are the most urgent need of tuberculosis control programs. A new series of synthetic 3-amino-4-arylpyridazino[4,3-b]indoles (pyridazinoindoles) were identified as inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The design, synthesis, and antimycobacterial activity of these compounds are described. While the most active compounds are still not comparable to the front-line drugs rifampicin and isoniazid, they do show promise. Most of the pyridazinoindoles with appreciable antituberculosis activity also inhibit monoamine oxidase, suggestive of a novel inhibitory effect on mycobacterial redox reactions.

pub-1906	Psychiatric issues in the management of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	INTRODUCTION: Psychiatric issues present a challenge in the treatment of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Both baseline psychiatric disorders and development of psychiatric complications related to anti-tuberculosis drugs and psychosocial factors require aggressive management. SETTING: A community-based non-governmental health organization in Lima, Peru. OBJECTIVE: To review the literature for psychiatric complications associated with anti-tuberculosis medications, to describe the incidence and prevalence of depression, anxiety and psychosis among individuals receiving MDR-TB therapy, and to detail the management approach used in this cohort. METHODS: A retrospective case series was performed among the first 75 patients to receive individualized MDR-TB therapy in Lima, Peru, between 1996 and 1999. RESULTS: Baseline depression and baseline anxiety were observed in respectively 52.2% and 8.7% of this cohort. Most individuals with baseline depression experienced improvement of depressive symptoms during the course of TB therapy. The incidence of depression, anxiety and psychosis during MDR-TB treatment was 13.3%, 12.0% and 12.0%, respectively. While the majority of individuals with depression, anxiety and psychosis required psychiatric pharmacotherapy, cycloserine was successfully continued in all but one case. CONCLUSION: Psychiatric comorbidities are not a contraindication to MDR-TB therapy. Management of psychiatric complications is possible without compromising anti-tuberculosis treatment.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; psychosis; depression; anxiety; cycloserine; Peru; review	COMMUNITY-BASED THERAPY; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS; MENTAL-DISORDERS; INDUCED DELIRIUM; PSYCHOSIS; DEPRESSION; ETHIONAMIDE; OFLOXACIN; STIGMA
pub-1907	Surveillance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis susceptibility to second-line drugs in Hong Kong, 1995-2002, after the implementation of DOTS-Plus	OBJECTIVE: To determine the trend in changes in susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, including to second-line drugs, from patients with a history of previous anti-tuberculosis (TB) treatment in a 'DOTSPlus' programme. METHODS: A retrospective survey of centralised M. tuberculosis laboratory records of all culture-positive cases over an 8-year period. The drug susceptibility of the isolates was determined using the absolute concentration method. trends of changes in susceptibility to first- and second-line drugs. RESULTS: Of 1921 patients with a previous history of treatment and positive cultures, 1425 (74.2%) had isolates susceptible to all four first-line drugs, while 176 (9.2%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB). For the MDR-TB group, 101 (57.4%) isolates were sensitive to all second-line drugs, while 30 (17.0%) were resistant to three or more second-line drugs. CONCLUSION: In a DOTS-Plus programme environment where there is strict control on use of second-line drugs, the prevalence of MDR-TB is low amongst retreatment cases and the prudent use of second-line drugs in a population with well functioning DOTS-Plus programme does not generate super-resistant strains. In circumstances where most retreatment strains are still susceptible and good laboratory support for detection of MDR cases is available, retreatment using first-line drugs is feasible.	tuberculosis; retreatment cases; DOTS-Plus; second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs; Hong Kong	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; STRAINS
pub-1908	Residual lung damage after completion of treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: Limpopo Province, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To assess the residual lung damage of patients who completed treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). DESIGN: Chest radiograph and lung function tests were performed at the end of treatment. The radiographs were read by two independent observers who attributed a zonal score of between 0 and 18, depending on the extent of radiographic abnormalities (opacification or cavitation), counted the number of visible cavities and measured the diameter of the largest cavity. RESULTS: The mean zonal score was 6.5. Cavitation was present in more than half of the patients. Of 33 patients, 31 (94%) had abnormal lung function tests. The median FEV1 was 63% and FVC was 57% of the predicted value. Restrictive and combined restrictive-obstructive lung function patterns were the predominant abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Residual lung damage in MDR-TB patients who completed treatment is common and extensive. This may increase the risk of relapse of tuberculosis and reduce the quality of life and life expectancy of these patients. Additional efforts are warranted to diagnose MDR-TB early to reduce the extent of residual lung damage. Close follow-up of MDR-TB patients completing treatment will have to be ensured to detect relapses.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; lung functions; chest radiograph	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; CHEMOTHERAPY; VALUES; COHORT; PERU
pub-1909	Treatment and follow-up of HIV-negative multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients in an infectious diseases reference hospital, Buenos Aires, Argentina	SETTING: An Argentinean reference hospital specialising in infectious diseases. OBJECTIVE: To assess the outcomes of all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients referred to or diagnosed at Hospital Muniz. DESIGN: Clinical study for the period 1996-1999, with follow-up until June 2002. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-one adult patients (52.5% female) with resistance to two to seven drugs were studied. Fifty patients (35.5%) had not been treated previously. The most frequently used second-line drugs were 5-F-quinolones, cycloserine and ethionamide in susceptibility based individually tailored three- to five-drug regimens. Hospital admission was associated with treatment success. Forty-five episodes of severe toxicity occurred. Treatment was successful in 51.8% of cases, but follow-up of 73 patients yielded 11.9% relapse. The mortality rate was 19.1% and default was 19.9%. Logistic regression analysis was statistically significant for treatment success in relation to patient admission, residence and resistance pattern. CONCLUSION: The burden of MDR-TB in this setting-prolonged infection, treatment cost and difficulties, low rates of cure and treatment adherence and high rates of fatality and relapse-can be improved by strengthening TB control programme activities and fighting against poverty and HIV/AIDS.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; HIV-negative patients; treatment; treatment outcome	THERAPY; PERU
10.1097_00063198_200405000_00011	Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis since 2002	Purpose of review Multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis is increasing globally, particularly in Eastern Europe. This review summarizes advances in our understanding of the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of MDRTB in 2002-2003. Recent findings The annual incidence of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis globally is unknown because systematic drug resistance data have been produced from only 60 countries internationally. Nevertheless, countries with effective tuberculosis programs see approximately 1% multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis among new cases annually. Hot spots with high rates such as countries of the former Soviet Union exist, and modeling of existing data suggests that between 250,000 and 500,000 new MDRTB cases occur globally. Unfortunately, mortality from multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis, particularly with HIV co-infection, remains high, and the global economic costs are also substantial. Research has produced many rapid and novel diagnostic methods for multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis, but culture-based methods remain the mainstay of analyzing resistance to drugs other than isoniazid and rifampicin. Treatment of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis is prolonged, and survival requires therapy with at least three agents to which the bacteria are susceptible. Individualized therapy forms the gold standard of treatment, but the high laboratory costs associated with this approach have led to studies of standardized treatment in middle-/low-income countries. Studies in Peru examined both approaches with comparable success. Nevertheless, even standardized treatment requires an accurate survey of drug resistance and an understanding and correction of the causes of the high rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis. Summary The global rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis are unknown. Rapid and early diagnosis of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis improves survival and is of a public health benefit. Treatment requires prolonged effective combination chemotherapy.	tuberculosis; multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis; HIV; molecular diagnostic methods; second-line drugs	LINE PROBE ASSAY; SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; MDR-TB; BEIJING FAMILY; RUSSIA; RIFAMPIN; SUSCEPTIBILITY; OUTCOMES
10.3201_eid1005.030718	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in central Asia	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has emerged as a major threat to TB control, particularly in the former Soviet Union. To determine levels of drug resistance within a directly observed treatment strategy (DOTS) program supported by Medecins Sans Frontieres in two regions in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, Central Asia, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of smear-positive TB patients in selected districts of Karakalpakstan (Uzbekistan) and Dashoguz (Turkmenistan). High levels of MDR-TB were found in both regions. In Karakalpakstan, 14 (13%) of 106 new patients were infected with MDR-TB; 43 (40%) of 107 previously treated patients were similarly infected. The proportions for Dashoguz were 4% (4/105 patients) and 18% (18/98 patients), respectively. Overall, 27% of patients with positive smear results whose infections were treated through the DOTS program in Karakalpakstan and 11% of similar patients in Dashoguz were infected with multidrug-resistant strains of TB on admission. These results show the need for concerted action by the international community to contain transmission and reduce the effects of MDR-TB.		DRUG-RESISTANCE; MDR-TB; OUTCOMES
pub-1912	Results of a standardised regimen for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Bangladesh	SETTING: Individualised regimens based on drug susceptibility test results, generally used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), require often unavailable expertise and resources. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a standardised regimen based on the susceptibility profiles of locally prevalent MDR-TB strains. DESIGN: The activities of a successful DOTS programme in Bangladesh were complemented by offering treatment with a standardised 21-month regimen to patients with laboratory-confirmed MDR-TB disease. The regimen contained kanamycin, ofloxacin, prothionamide, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, isoniazid and clofazimine. Clinical and bacteriological progress was monitored quarterly until treatment completion, then 6 monthly for 2 years. RESULTS: The status at the end of treatment of this cohort of 58 documented MDR-TB patients was as follows: eight (14%) deaths, seven (12%) defaults, three (5%) failures and 40 (69%) cures. One bacteriologically-confirmed relapse was recognised. Frequent and sometimes serious side effects proved to be the main problem, suggesting the need for a better tolerated but equally effective regimen. CONCLUSION: A standardised approach may provide a reasonable alternative to individualised treatment of MDR-TB in resource-poor settings. However, DOTS-plus programmes in resource-poor settings may confront significant difficulties in the enrolment, diagnosis and management of MDR-TB patients.	multi-drug resistance; treatment; control; tuberculosis	SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; COMMUNITY-BASED THERAPY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; RIFAMPIN; DOTS; PERU
pub-1913	Drug resistance trends among previously treated tuberculosis patients in a national registry in Peru, 1994-2001	SETTING: National mycobacteriology reference laboratory in Peru conducting routine testing of susceptibility to isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin, in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from previously treated patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the percentage of isolates resistant to each of five anti-tuberculosis agents and to ascertain in these data the presence of trends of clinical relevance. DESIGN: Retrospective study of a national registry of M. tuberculosis isolates from patients referred for drug susceptibility testing between 1994 and 2001. RESULTS: Among 14736 isolates tested, 10837 (73.5%, 95% CI 72.8-74.3) demonstrated anti-tuberculosis resistance, and 8455 (57.4%, 95%CI 56.6-58.2) demonstrated resistance to at least both isoniazid and rifampin, by convention defined as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). A significant increasing trend could be discerned for resistance to each of the drugs tested and in isolates classified as MDR-TB (P < 0.001 for trend). Additional clinically relevant trends were found in poly-resistance and multidrug resistance percentages. CONCLUSIONS: Data from a national reference laboratory can be used to inform the design of retreatment regimens.	national reference laboratory; surveillance; treatment failure; MDR-TB	NEW-YORK-CITY; SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; DOTS PLUS STRATEGY; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; MDR-TB; SURVEILLANCE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; COUNTRIES; THERAPY
10.3346_jkms.2004.19.2.167	Six-month therapy with aerosolized interferon-gamma for refractory multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis	The aim of this study was to investigate the adjuvant effects of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) inhalation therapy for six months in the treatment of refractory multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Aerosolized IFN-gamma was given to six MDR-TB patients with persistent positive smears and cultures despite long-term medical treatment. The patients received aerosolized two million international units of IFN-gamma three times a week for 6 months while they continued on identical antituberculous chemotherapy. Before IFN-gamma inhalation therapy, the patients received a median of 6.5 (range, 4 to 7) antituberculous drugs for median duration of 29 months (range, 7 to 76). After IFN-gamma inhalation therapy, sputum smears remained persistently positive in all patients throughout the study period. Sputum cultures were transiently negative at the 4th month in two patients, but became positive again at the end of 6 months of IFN-gamma therapy. Five patients had radiological improvement including three patients who showed a decrease in the size of the cavitary lesions. Resectional surgery could be performed in one patient in whom substantial clinical and radiological improvement was noted after IFN-gamma inhalation therapy. These results suggest that IFN-gamma inhalation therapy may be effective for some cases of refractory MDR-TB who are otherwise not responding to conventional therapy.	tuberculosis; pulmonary; tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; interferon-gamma; recombinant administration; inhalation; aerosols	DISEASE
10.1086_381973	Multidrug-resistant tuberculous meningitis in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa	Multidrug-resistant (MDR) pulmonary tuberculosis ( TB) is well described in the literature. Reports of MDR TB meningitis (MDR-TBM), however, are limited to case reports and a single case series. During the period of 1999 - 2002, 350 patients with TBM were identified by cerebrospinal fluid culture for TB. Thirty patients (8.6%) had TB that was resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. All 30 patients were included in this study. We reviewed hospital charts of the patients with MDR-TBM and describe our experience. Seventeen patients with MDR-TBM died, and, of those who were known to be alive, many experienced significant morbidity. Eighteen patients were HIV positive. Twenty-two patients had been treated for TB in the past, 3 patients had received no previous treatment for TB, and the history of TB treatment was unknown for 5 patients. The study highlights the prevalence of MDR-TBM and identifies new challenges in the management of affected patients.		HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; HIV
10.1378_chest.125.3.974	Hypokalemia among patients receiving treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Introduction: Between January 1999 and December 2000, 125 patients in Lima, Peru were enrolled in individualized treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Hypokalemia was observed to be an important adverse effect encountered in this cohort. Objective: To identify risk factors associated with the development and persistence of hypokalemia during MDR-TB therapy, and to review the incidence and management of hypokalemia in patients receiving MDR-TB therapy. Methods: A retrospective case series of 125 patients who received individualized therapy for MDR-TB between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2000. Results: Among 115 patients who were screened for electrolyte abnormalities, 31.3% had hypokalemia, defined as a potassium level of < 3.5 mEq/L. Mean serum potassium at time of diagnosis was 2.85 mEq/L. Diagnosis of low serum potassium occurred, on average, after 5.1 months of individualized therapy. Multivariate analysis of risk factors for this adverse reaction identified two causes: administration of capreomycin, and low initial body weight. Normalization of potassium levels was achieved in 86% of patients. Conclusions: Electrolyte disturbance was frequently encountered in our cohort of patients with MDR-TB. Successful screening and management of hypokalemia was facilitated by training the health-care team in the use of a standardized algorithm. Morbidity from hypokalemia can be significant; however, effective management of this side effect is possible without sacrificing MDR-TB treatment efficacy.	capreomycin; electrolyte; hypokalemia; hypomagnesemia; magnesium; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; potassium; tuberculosis	ELECTROLYTE ABNORMALITIES; HYPOCALCEMIA; CAPREOMYCIN; THERAPY; HYPOMAGNESEMIA
pub-1917	Identification of MDR-TB Beijing/W and other Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotypes in Nairobi, Kenya	SETTING: Suspected tuberculosis (TB) patients in Nairobi, Kenya. OBJECTIVE: To identify the presence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Beijing/W type and other genotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. METHODS: Thirty-three isolates resistant to one or more drugs (resistance ratio method), including 15 MDR isolates and 40 susceptible isolates selected at random, were analysed by dot-blot hybridisation for mutations associated with resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin and ethambutol. All strains were genotypically classified using spoligotyping. RESULTS: Of the 33 drug-resistant isolates, 21 (64%) were from males and 12 (36%) were from females. Mutations associated with resistance to isoniazid (katG 315) and rifampicin (rpoB526, 531) were confirmed in 83.3% and 100% of the isolates, respectively, and in 87% of the MDR isolates. Mutations were detected in 25% and 71.5% of the isolates resistant to streptomycin (rpsL43) and ethambutol (embB306), respectively. No mutations were detected in drug-susceptible isolates. Spoligotyping grouped the isolates into 25 groups. Ten of these groups corresponded to previously identified strain groups, including seven families in the international database. One of these families (CAS1) comprised six (40%) of the 15 MDR isolates. Another family (Beijing) had six (8.3%) isolates, of which two (33.3%) were MDR (Beijing/W). CONCLUSION: This study is the first in Kenya and the second in sub-Saharan Africa to report the presence of MDR Beijing/W type and other possible drug-resistant outbreak strains. Application of the molecular techniques and markers will allow us to monitor the spread of existing drug-resistant strains and the appearance of new ones.	drug resistance; MDR-TB; Beijing/W genotypes; Nairobi; Kenya	DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; LENGTH-POLYMORPHISM ANALYSIS; NEW-YORK-CITY; TRANSMISSION; SURVEILLANCE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; OUTBREAK; STRAINS; COMMUNITY; DIAGNOSIS
pub-1918	Self-administered, standardized regimens for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in South Korea	SETTING: National Masan Tuberculosis Hospital, Masan, South Korea, a 430-bed tertiary referral hospital specializing in tuberculosis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the treatment outcomes of standardized, empiric regimens for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of the hospital records of 142 patients with MDR-TB who had failed short-course chemotherapy. Between 1 January 1998 and 30 June 2000, patients were started on one of two standardized, empiric regimens based on previous treatment history. Drug susceptibility testing of the infecting strain was not used to modify the treatment regimen. Treatment was continued for at least 18 months after conversion to a negative culture. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients (44.1%) were cured and discharged from treatment after at least 18 months of negative cultures; 18 (12.7%) failed treatment, 41 (28.9%) defaulted, four died (2.8%), and 15 (10.6%) were transferred to another institution. One patient is still on treatment. Resistance to ofloxacin was the only risk factor related to poor outcome (death or failure) in univariate or multiple logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of resistance to second-line drugs are likely a cause of poor outcome of MDR-TB therapy in Korea. Directly observed therapy and other methods to increase patient compliance should be considered nationwide, as they may improve MDR-TB treatment outcomes.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; drug therapy; Korea	SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; DRUG SENSITIVITY; THERAPY
pub-1919	A microplate indicator-based method for determining the susceptibility of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis to antimicrobial agents	SETTING: Reference Laboratory, Buenos Aires Province Tuberculosis Control Program, Dr Cetrangolo Hospital, Argentina. OBJECTIVE: To obtain a rapid, inexpensive method of determining minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of several drugs acting on multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB), a colorimetric, microplate-based assay (M-MTT) was developed. DESIGN: One hundred and one clinical isolates were studied. Drugs were placed in a microtiter plate, and several two fold dilutions were made in situ. Kanamycin, capreomycin, ethionamide, para-aminosalicylic acid and clarithromycin were tested in a range concentration of 8.0-0.25 mug/ml, cycloserine 60.0-1.9 mug/ml, clofazimine 3.0-0.10 mug/ml, levofloxacin 4.0-0.13 mug/ml and rifabutin 1.0-0.13 mug/ml. General indicator 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) at 5.0 mg/ml was used for visualising cellular growth and viability. The proportion method with Middlebrook 7H11 was used as the gold standard. RESULTS: MICs by M-MTT were obtained at on average 8 days and correlated with those obtained using the proportion method., In our conditions, the total cost of MIC determination for nine drugs was US$5.00. CONCLUSION: M-MTT could be used as a simple, rapid, low-cost technology to test the susceptibility of MDR-TB strains to several second-line and alternative drugs, with the objective of orienting future treatment regimens.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; second-line drugs; colorimetric microtiter-based method	3-(4,5-DIMETHYLTHIAZOL-2-YL)-2,5-DIPHENYL TETRAZOLIUM BROMIDE; DRUG-RESISTANCE; COLORIMETRIC METHOD; RAPID DETECTION; RIFAMPIN; ASSAY; COMPLEX; TESTS; AVIUM; MICS
10.1099_jmm.0.05343_0	Genotypic analysis of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Monterrey, Mexico	Thirty-seven multidrug-resistant and 13 pan-susceptible isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were analysed for the diversity of genotypes associated with known drug-resistance mechanisms. The isolates were obtained from patients attending a university tuberculosis clinic in Monterrey, Mexico. A total of 25 IS61 10-RFLP patterns were obtained from the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates. Approximately 65% of the MDR-TB isolates were attributed to secondary resistance. Different drug-susceptibility patterns were seen with the clustered isolates. The percentage of isolates resistant to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB) and streptomycin (STR) was 100, 97.3, 48.7 and 67.6, respectively. The most common resistance-associated polymorph isms for the four drugs were as follows: INH, Ser315Thr (67.6%) in katG; RIF, Ser450Leu (41.7%) in rpoB; EMB, Met306IIe/VaI/Leu (66.7 %) in ernbB; and STIR, Lys43Arg (24%) in rpsL. Drug-resistance-associated mutations were similar to changes occurring in isolates from other areas of the world, but unique, previously unreported, mutations in katG (n = 5), rpoB (n = 1) and rrs (n = 3) were also identified.

10.1016_S0140_6736_03_15394_9	Scaling-up treatment for HIV/AIDS: lessons learned from multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	The UN has launched an initiative to place 3 million people in developing countries on antiretroviral AIDS treatment by end 2005 (the 3 by 5 target). Lessons for HIV/AIDS treatment scale-up emerge from recent experience with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Expansion of treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis through the multipartner mechanism known as the Green Light Committee (GLC) has enabled gains in areas relevant to 3 by 5, including policy development, drug procurement, rational use of drugs, and the strengthening of health systems. The successes of the GLC and the obstacles it has encountered provide insights for building sustainable HIV/AIDS treatment programmes.		RESOURCE-POOR SETTINGS; MDR-TB; HIV; HEALTH; PERU

pub-1923	Identifying early treatment failure on Category I therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis in Lima Ciudad, Peru	SETTING: Ambulatory, public tuberculosis treatment facilities, central Lima, Peru. OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for failure on directly observed Category I therapy. DESIGN: Case-control study. All failures of Category I (2HREZ/4H(2)R(2)) therapy in 2000 (2.9% of smear-positive TB patients) were included as cases; two controls per case were matched on health center and approximate time of treatment initiation. RESULTS: The study included 38 cases and 76 controls, all new smear-positive, pulmonary TB patients treated with Category I therapy in central Lima in 2000. Neither treatment irregularity nor incidence of adverse events predicted failure in the study group. Mean baseline body mass index was lower in cases than in controls (P = 0.06). Cases gained less weight during therapy (P = 0.01). Smear positivity at 2 months of therapy was strongly associated with failure (OR 11.7; 95%CI 2.4-57.5). No controls had positive smears at or after 3 months of therapy (OR [corrected] 144.9; 95%CI 8.4-2500). Nearly 75% of cases with isolates tested for susceptibility to first-line drugs had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). CONCLUSION: A large proportion of failures on Category I therapy can be identified early. As three-quarters of patients with susceptibility results have MDR-TB, early referral for culture and drug susceptibility testing is critical for prompt initiation of appropriate therapy and improved outcomes.	treatment failure; smear conversion; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; RURAL SOUTH-AFRICA; ACID-FAST BACILLI; DRUG-RESISTANCE; RETREATMENT REGIMEN; SPUTUM MICROSCOPY; RELAPSE; COHORT; SMEARS
10.1086_379895	Effect of drug resistance on the generation of secondary cases of tuberculosis	Background. The results of animal studies suggest that isoniazid-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are less pathogenic than isoniazid-susceptible strains. Here, we assess the relative pathogenicity of drug-resistant and drug-susceptible strains, in a human population. Methods. We linked IS6110 genotype patterns of M. tuberculosis strains with drug-susceptibility test results and epidemiologic information for 85% of culture-positive incident cases of tuberculosis (TB) in San Francisco during 1991-1999. We assumed that drug-susceptible and drug-resistant strains were transmitted to secondary case patients if the drug-resistance and genotype patterns were identical. We calculated the number of secondary cases for each drug-resistance pattern and determined the relative secondary-case rate ratio (SR) of drug-resistant TB,to drug-susceptible TB. Results. There were 1800 patients with culture-positive TB, drug-susceptibility test results, and genotyping results. The overall SR of drug-resistant to drug-susceptible TB cases was 0.51 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.69). The SR was 0.29 (95% Cl, 0.15-0.57) for isoniazid-resistant strains, 0.10 (95% Cl, 0.02-0.42) for strains resistant to both isoniazid and streptomycin, and 0.88 (95% Cl, 0.53-1.47) for streptomycin-resistant strains. There were no secondary cases caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. The SR for rifampin-resistant cases was 2.33 (95% Cl, 1.04-5.25). Seventy-eight percent (7/9) of the patients with rifampin-resistant secondary cases of TB were scropositive for human immunodeficiency virus. Conclusion. In the context of an effective TB program in San Francisco, strains that were resistant to isoniazid either alone or in combination with other drugs were less likely to result in secondary cases than were drug-susceptible strains. In this setting, isoniazid-resistant and MDR TB cases were not likely to produce new, incident drug-resistant TB cases.

10.1136_adc.88.12.1106	Culture confirmed multidrug resistant tuberculosis: diagnostic delay, clinical features, and outcome	Aims: To determine the delay in diagnosis of multidrug resistant ( MDR) tuberculosis ( TB), the correlation between drug susceptibility patterns of adult- child contact pairs, the effectiveness of treatment, and the outcome in these children. Methods: MDR M tuberculosis culture results of children were prospectively collected during a four year period in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, an area with a TB incidence of 589/ 100 000 population, and a new MDR TB rate of 0.94%. Folder reviews were done to retrieve clinical information. Children not already on treatment at our MDR TB clinic or TB hospital were recalled and appropriate treatment was started. Follow up was done for as long as possible. Results: Thirty nine children, median age 4.5 years at first TB diagnosis and 6.2 years on MDR culture confirmation, were seen. Delay in starting appropriate MDR treatment after TB diagnosis was a median of 2 days if MDR TB source cases were taken into account, but 246 days if the drug susceptibility pattern of the source case was not considered, and 283 days if there was no known tuberculosis source case. Correlation between the drug susceptibility results of the child's and adult source case's isolates was 68%. Seventeen children had smear positive tuberculosis, of whom 13 had cavitatory pulmonary disease. Eight children had central nervous system TB. Thirty six children were treated for MDR tuberculosis, of whom four died. Conclusions: Obtaining a detailed contact history is essential as a delay in starting appropriate MDR antituberculosis treatment has potentially serious consequences.

10.3201_eid0912.020731	Multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in HIV-infected persons, Peru	During 1999 to 2000, we identified HIV-infected persons with new episodes of tuberculosis (TB) at 10 hospitals in Lima, Peru, and a random sample of other Lima residents with TB. Multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB was documented in 35 (43%) of 81 HIV-positive patients and 38 (3.9%) of 965 patients who were HIV-negative or of unknown HIV status (p < 0.001). HIV-positive patients with MDR-TB were concentrated at three hospitals that treat the greatest numbers of HIV-infected persons with TB. Of patients with TB, those with HIV infection differed from those without known HIV infection in having more frequent prior exposure to clinical services and more frequent previous TB therapy or prophylaxis. However, MDR-TB in HIV-infected patients was not associated with previous TB therapy or prophylaxis. MDR-TB is an ongoing problem in HIV-infected persons receiving care in public hospitals in Lima and Callao; they represent sentinel cases for a potentially larger epidemic of nosocomial MDR-TB.

pub-1927	Contact investigations as a means of detection and timely treatment of persons with infectious multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: Two regions of metropolitan Lima, Peru. OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcomes of two contact investigation strategies used in therapy enrollment cohorts of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). DESIGN: From 28 August 1996 to 31 December 1999, 91 index patients received individualized MDR-TB therapy (Group A), and from 1 October 1997 to 31 December 1999, another 101 index patients received a standardized MDR-TB regimen (Group B). We conducted a retrospective chart review and home visits to identify secondary cases among close contacts of both of these groups. Group A secondary cases with MDR-TB received therapy based on the drug susceptibility profile of their infecting strain, while Group B secondary cases received standard short-course therapy. RESULTS: Among 945 close contacts, 72 secondary TB cases (8%) were found. Of 42 who had drug-susceptibility testing, 35 (84 %) were MDR-TB, but only seven (17 %) had the same drug susceptibility profile as the index case. Cure exceeded 80% in Group A secondary cases, while only half of Group B secondary cases were cured (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.2). CONCLUSION: Contact investigation protocols coupled with enrollment in MDR-TB therapy are a useful means of detecting and promptly treating persons with infectious MDR-TB. In settings with endemic MDR strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, effective therapy of contacts of MDR-TB patients requires knowledge of drug susceptibility for each contact with active disease.	contact investigations; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; case finding; DOTS-Plus; Peru	DRUG-RESISTANT; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; TRANSMISSION; OUTCOMES; STRAINS; DISEASE
pub-1928	Tuberculosis infecton and disease in children living in households of Filipino patients with tuberculosis: a preliminary report	SETTING: DOTS Clinic with a DOTS-Plus pilot project for the management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in a high burden country. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) infection and disease among pediatric household contacts of patients with pulmonary TB (PTB). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODOLOGY: One hundred and fifty-three children aged 0-15 years in the households of 62 bacteriologically confirmed PTB patients, including 44 with MDR-TB, were studied. BCG scars were noted, and tuberculin skin test (TST), screening chest radiography, and sputum or gastric aspirate smear and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in those with radiographic findings suggestive of PTB were done. RESULTS: For children in this study, the prevalences of latent TB infection (LTBI), radiographically diagnosed pulmonary TB, and bacillary pulmonary TB were 69.2%, 3.3%, and 0.65%, respectively. Only age greater than or equal to5 years was found to be a significant predictor of LTBI (OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.43-7.01). CONCLUSION: Contact investigation for active case-finding and early treatment of TB in children from households of patients with active PTB is essential for TB control. Further study on a more precise definition of TB infection and strategies for control in this population will be pursued.

We have tested 150 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates against the second-line drugs ethionamide, kanamycin, capreomycin, ofloxacin, and para-aminosalicylic acid by the colorimetric resazurin microtiter assay and the proportion method. By visual reading, MICs were obtained after 8 days. A very good correlation between results by the colorimetric resazurin microtiter assay and the proportion method was obtained. The colorimetric resazurin microtiter assay is inexpensive, rapid, and simple to perform, and implementation of the assay is feasible for low-resource countries.

pub-1930	Encouraging outcomes in the first year of a TB control demonstration program: Orel Oblast, Russia	SETTING: Orel, Russia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate outcomes of tuberculosis (TB) patients treated in the first year of a TB control demonstration project using a revised strategy of directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS). Standard methods recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) were adapted to include mycobacterial cultures. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis of TB patients diagnosed between October 1999 and September 2000. RESULTS: Among 749 TB patients, 65% had bacteriologic confirmation of pulmonary TB, 31% were diagnosed clinically, and 4% had extra-pulmonary TB. Most (92%) had no previous TB treatment, but 8% were identified as retreatment cases. Of all patients, 41% had new sputum smear-positive TB. No patients were HIV-infected. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB levels were 3% among new and 17% among retreatment patients. Among new smear-positive patients, treatment success was 79% (72% cure, 7% completion); remaining outcomes were 8% failure, 3% default, 8% death, and 1% transfer. Success rates for new culture-positive and clinically diagnosed patients were 81 % and 91 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: Despite historical differences, successful implementation of the revised TB strategy in Russia is possible. Treatment success rates were high, suggesting WHO targets of 85% cure for smear-positive patients is attainable. Obstacles include drug resistance and elevated death rates among smear-positive patients.	tuberculosis; outcomes; Russia; WHO TB control strategy; cohort analysis	TUBERCULOSIS; PRISON
pub-1931	Characterization of clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to drugs and detection of RpoB mutation in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the Philippines	SETTING: Retrospective study of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates at the STD/AIDS Cooperative Central Laboratory, Philippines. OBJECTIVE: To describe patterns of M. tuberculosis resistance against first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs, and to analyze the rpoB gene codon mutation of rifampicin (RMP) resistant isolates and correlate genotypic and phenotypic patterns. DESIGN: One hundred and sixty-four M. tuberculosis complex isolates were retrieved for phenotypic analysis; 89 were resistant to any anti-tuberculosis drug and 50 were RMP-resistant, whereas 48 were multidrug-resistant (MDR). Of these 48, only 33 were available for genotypic analysis of the rpoB gene. RESULTS: Most drug-resistant isolates were phenotypically resistant to isoniazid (INH) (93%), and the probability of an RMP-resistant isolate becoming MDR was 96%. In 33 MDR isolates, 13 types of mutations in nine independent codons were identified; the most frequently mutated codons were S531L (61%) and G510H (15%), which were present in 76% (25/33) of the isolates. S531L was noted in 85.7% of the RMP + INH + SM resistant isolates, while only 80% of the isolates with INH + RMP, EMB + SM resistance showed this mutation. CONCLUSION: The high probability of RMP isolates being MDR suggests that genetic analysis of RMP resistance is useful in detecting MDR-TB. Worldwide accumulation of findings on circulating MDR-TB strains provides indispensable information about the re-emergence of TB.	rpoB gene; MDR-TB; M. tuberculosis; rifampicin resistance	RIFAMPIN RESISTANCE; RAPID DETECTION; SAUDI-ARABIA; GENE RPOB; STRAINS; ASSAY; PCR
10.1007_s00108_003_1074_6	Surgical therapy of pulmonary tuberculosis	In individual cases of tuberculosis surgical therapy is part of an interdisciplinary therapeutic concept. Identifying the optimal point of time for surgery has a strong impact on the further course of the healing process and thus on the prognosis. Indications for surgical therapy are: 1.multi-drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (MDR-TB), 2.late-onset complications (apergilloma, tuberculosis of the tracheobronchial tree or of mediastinal or hilar lymphnodes), 3.tuberculosis of the pleura. In MDR-TB an individual concept for therapy based on all chemotherapeutic options as well as thorough planning of the surgical procedure must be provided. Resections in tuberculotic late-onset complications should be performed in patients with persisting cavernous pulmonary tuberculosis as well as in patients with posttuberculosis complex; main goal is the prevention of tuberculotic relapse. Surgical strategies for tuberculosis of the pleura include the debridement of the pleural cavity in videoassisted surgical technique, decortication, partial thoracoplasty with musculoplasty or chest fenestration.	surgery of tuberculosis; posttuberculosis complex; decortication; thoracoplasty; chest fenestration	EXPERIENCE
pub-1933	Beyond DOTS: Avenues ahead in the management of tuberculosis	India has almost 30% of the global burden of tuberculosis (TB)one person dies of the disease every minute in our country. India has mounted the second-largest DOTS programme In the world to control this disease. However, DOTS has its limitations and newer approaches have been developed over the years to overcome the global burden of tuberculosis. Problems with health facilities, patients, drugs and the disease itself constitute some of the hurdles in the implementation of the DOTS programme. In an attempt to go beyond DOTS, the WHO launched the 'Stop TB Initiative' in 1988. Against the background of Irrational antituberculosis drug use, which contributes to increasing drug resistance, the effective involvement of private healthcare providers is Imperative to achieve better geographical and patient coverage for the implementation of DOTS. The WHO is currently addressing the issue of involving private practitioners in tuberculosis control in a programme called Public-Private Mix DOTS (PPM DOTS). The Stop TB Initiative is also active in the area of dual Infection with HIV and tuberculosis, and the initiatives that have been taken in this area include 'ProTEST', community contribution to tuberculosis care, and development and dissemination of training materials and guidelines. The DOTS-Plus strategy for the management of multidrug resistant (MDR)-TB and the establishment of the Green Light Committee to review project applications In this area are Initiatives taken to curb the problem of drug resistance in tuberculosis. Even decades after the introduction of the DOTS strategy, much needs to be done to expand the services to the entire population; It Is now essential to develop strategies that go beyond DOTS.

10.1378_chest.124.4.1476	Comparative roles of levofloxacin and ofloxacin in the treatment of multidrug resistant tuberculosis - Preliminary results of a retrospective study from Hong Kong	Objective: To compare levofloxacin and ofloxacin in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Patients and methods: A retrospective analysis of 106 patients. with MDR-TB (February 1990 through December 2000) receiving directly observed therapy with fluoroquinolone and accompanying drugs, which mainly included aminoglycosides, cycloserine, ethionamide/prothionamide, and pyrazinamide, was performed. Clinical data from 99 suitable patients were subjected to univariate analysis, stratification, and multiple logistic regression to compare the roles of levofloxacin and ofloxacin in multidrug regimens. Results: Forty patients received 612.5 +/- 79.0 mg qd levofloxacin (mean +/- SD), and 59 patients received 628.8 +/- 101.8 mg qd ofloxacin together with similar active second-line drugs for similar durations. The times to sputum smear (both 1.8 months) and culture conversion (both 2.1 months) were equivalent. Adverse reactions occurred at similar rates (10.0% vs 11.9%). The combined treatment success rate was 83.8%, being higher among ofloxacin-susceptible than ofloxacin-resistant cases (90.5% vs 64.0%, p < 0.01). The success rates for the levofloxacin group were 90.0% (overall), 96.2% (ofloxacin-suseeptible cases), and 78.6% (ofloxacin-resistant cases) in comparison with 79.7%, 87.5%, and 45.5%, respectively, for the ofloxacin group (Mantel-Haenszel common odds ratio estimate, 4.0; p < 0.05). Bacillary susceptibility to ofloxacin, good adherence, radiographic extent of one lung or less, and use of levofloxacin were independent predictors of favorable outcome (odds ratios, 7.6 to 21.3). One patient each from both groups relapsed. Conclusion: Levofloxacin was found to be more efficacious than ofloxacin when incorporated into multidrug regimens used for treatment of MDR-TB.	levofloxacin; multidrug; ofloxacin; resistance; tuberculosis	IN-VITRO; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; PHARMACOKINETICS; QUINOLONES; EFFICACY
pub-1935	Characteristics, management and outcome of patients with recurrent tuberculosis under routine programme conditions in Malawi	SETTING: All 43 non-private hospitals in Malawi, which registered TB cases between 1 July 1999 and 30 June 2000. OBJECTIVES: To determine 1) the characteristics, management and treatment outcome, 2) timing of the previous episode of TB, and 3) pattern of drug resistance in patients registered with recurrent smear-positive pulmonary TB. DESIGN: Retrospective data collection using TB registers and laboratory culture and drug sensitivity registers. RESULTS: There were 748 recurrent patients; data were available for 747. Of these, 487 (65%) successfully completed a re-treatment regimen, 185 (25%) died and the remainder had another outcome. Information about previous TB was recorded for 491 (66%) patients. In 286 (58%) there were 2 years or less between completing and re-starting treatment. Only 307 (41%) patients had sputum sent for culture and drug sensitivity tests. In 164 patients with cultures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 122 (81%) were fully sensitive, 25 (15%) had resistance to isoniazid and/or streptomycin, and 6 (4%) had resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin (MDR-TB). CONCLUSION: Patients with recurrent TB had acceptable treatment outcomes, and most had fully sensitive organisms. Over half had recurrent TB 2 years or less after completing treatment. Ways to prevent recurrence need to be investigated and implemented in the field.	recurrent smear-positive TB; Malawi	HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; 2-YEAR FOLLOW-UP; COHORT; RESISTANCE; RELAPSE; TRENDS; HIV
pub-1936	Detection of isoniazid and rifampin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and restriction fragment length polymorphism	Anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug-resistance, mainly multi-drug resistance (MDR-TB), represents an important public health problem in several countries. Aim of our study is to identify the presence of these mutations in M. tuberculosis isoniazid- and rifampin-resistant strains isolated in our Institute; to evaluate linkage between type of mutation and level of resistance; to determine the usefulness of easy molecular techniques for rapid detection of such mutations on body specimens. Isoniazid- and rifampin-resistance was tested on 67 M. tuberculosis strains by Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) and Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assays, using HaeIII, PstuI, BsteII, BstuI enzymes. Drug-resistance of control strains was determined by cultural techniques (fluorimetry- BACTEC 9120). Cultural assay showed isoniazid- and rifampin-resistance in 6.12 and 2%, respectively (data confirmed by SSCP assay). Mutation of katG, linked to isoniazid resistance, was detected using BstuI enzyme, and mutation of rpoB, expression of reduced sensitivity to rifampin, using HaeIII. 15 body specimens, M. tuberculosis-positive to conventional assays, were tested by SSCP technique. Epidemiologic reports of numerous cases of tuberculosis due to MDR strains induce to detect quickly both Mycobacteria and drug-resistance, in order to start prompt effective therapy. On this basis, molecular assays are useful for a rapid therapeutic decision.

10.1016_S1567_1348_03_00086_8	Clinical and genetic risk factors for the development of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in non-HIV infected patients at a tertiary care center in India: a case-control study	Genetic susceptibility of the host to multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is not fully understood. We undertook a case-control study at a tertiary care center at New Delhi, India to identify the clinical and genetic predictors of MDR-TB as compared to the drug sensitive TB cases. Patients with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis were identified on the basis of drug sensitivity testing by the proportion method. Treatment was initiated according to standard norms and all patients were followed up during the period. Genomic DNA extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cell pellet was used for amplification of HLA class II region (second exon) with a set of forward (5') and reverse (3') primers. A sequence specific 5' biotinylated probes were used to determine 12 DRB1, 8 DQA1 and 13 DQB1 alleles by the PCR-SSOP method. Past history of disease, higher severity of illness, inadequacy of drug treatment and presence of HLA-DRB1*14, DQB1*0503 and DQB1*0502 alleles were found to be significant risk factors for MDR-TB. Multivariate analysis identified poor past compliance to treatment (odds ratio, OR = 6.6; 95% confidence interval, CI [2.0-21.5]), higher number of cavities (OR = 6; 95% CI [2.1-17.3]) in chest radiographs and the presence of the HLA-DRB1*14 allele (OR = 8.2; 95% CI [2.1-31.3]) as independent predictors of MDR-TB. Our results suggest that a combination of clinical and immunogenetic parameters could provide better information on drug resistance in tuberculosis with implications in therapy. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.

pub-1938	The risk of MDR-TB and polyresistant tuberculosis among the civilian population of Tomsk city, Siberia, 1999	SETTING: Tomsk, Siberia, Russian Federation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between TB susceptibility patterns and risk factors among a civilian cohort of new cases in Tomsk city in 1999. DESIGN: Population-based study. The association between MDR-TB or PROMDR-TB, defined as resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin (MDR) or to isoniazid, ethambutol, and streptomycin (rifampicin mono-sensitive), and hypothesized risk factors was determined. Univariable analysis with and without stratification for history of incarceration and stepwise logistic regression modeling were used. RESULTS: Overall, 49.6% of participants were infected with a Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain resistant to at least one prescribed anti-tuberculosis medication. PROMDR-TB and MDR-TB were prevalent in 17.2% and 13.1% of participants, respectively. Logistic regression modeling indicated that good residence (OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.4-6.9), treatment default (OR 4.4,95% CI 2.1-9.3) and psychological disorder (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.0-10.9) were associated with PROMDR-TB. Both good residence (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-6.0) and treatment default (OR 5.3, 95% CI 2.4-11.6) were associated with MDR-TB. History of incarceration was not found to be significant. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the hypothesis that drug-resistant disease among the Tomsk city population is not directly linked to history of incarceration, nor is it an extension of drug resistance in prisons. Rather, drug resistance in the civil sector reflects problems specific to the sector itself.	multidrug resistance; tuberculosis; prisons; TB control; Russia; Siberia	SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PRISONS
pub-1939	Drug susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to fluoroquinolones: first experience with a quality control panel in the Nordic-Baltic collaboration	In the first attempt to establish a quality assurance programme for susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to fluoroquinolones, 20 strains with different fluoroquinolone susceptibility patterns were distributed by the Supranational Reference Laboratory in Stockholm to the other mycobacterial reference laboratories of the Nordic and Baltic countries. Susceptibility testing to fluoroquinolones was performed according to routine procedures in each laboratory. Results were compared to sequence analysis of the gyrA gene and minimal inhibitory concentration determination. Most laboratories found identical susceptibility patterns. The two resistant strains were correctly identified by all laboratories, but three laboratories each falsely reported one susceptible strain as resistant. These results indicate that the participating laboratories yield reliable results in detection of fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, although the need for a standardised quality assurance programme for drug susceptibility testing for fluoroquinolones is stressed by the strains falsely reported as resistant.	second-line drugs; MDR-TB; quality assurance	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; LABORATORY NETWORK; ASSURANCE PROGRAM; CIPROFLOXACIN; SURVEILLANCE; MUTATIONS; OFLOXACIN
pub-1940	Impact of the growing HIV-1 epidemic on multidrug-resistant tuberculosis control in Latvia	Latvia, a country with levels of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB among the highest in the world, experienced a 58-fold increase in HIV seroprevalence among all persons tested in the country from 1996 through 2001. In addition, HIV seroprevalence among TB cases increased from 0.4% to 1.4%, and among MDR-TB cases from 0% to 5.6% from 1998 through 2001, potentially compromising gains made to date in controlling the country's MDR-TB epidemic. The following will be critical to the future of MDR-TB control in Latvia: containing HIV transmission in the country, particularly among injection drug users who comprised 72% of all HIV cases reported in the country by the end of 2001, as well as 81% of all MDR-TB cases co-infected with HIV; expanding capabilities to more rapidly detect and successfully treat patients with MDR-TB; developing mutual TB control strategies between the National TB and AIDS programs; and continuing to improve institutional infection control measures, particularly in hospitals and prisons where an increasing number of persons infected with HIV come into contact with persons with active MDR-TB.	tuberculosis; multidrug resistance; HIV; Latvia	HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS
10.1128_JCM.41.9.4372_4377.2003	Molecular epidemology of pulmonary tuberculosis in Belgrade, Central Serbia	In order to gain precise data on the actual epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) in Belgrade, central Serbia, we conducted the molecular epidemiological investigation described herein. IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing of 176 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was performed. These strains were obtained from 48.4% of all patients diagnosed with culture-proven pulmonary TB from April through September 1998 and from May through October 1999. Clusters containing strains with identical RFLP IS6110 patterns were assumed to have arisen from recent transmission. Of the 176 cases, 55 (31.2%) were grouped into 23 clusters ranging in size from two to six patients. Nearly 80% of clustered patients were directly interviewed, and transmission between family-unrelated contacts was found to be predominant in the study population. Classical contact investigation identified only 2 (3.6%) of the 55 clustered patients. The clustering of TB patients was not associated with any demographic or clinical characteristic other than infection with multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis strains. Nearly 70% of MDR strains were clustered, which indicates active transmission of MDR TB in Belgrade. However, this was not observed by conventional epidemiologic surveillance. In conclusion, the first molecular epidemiologic analysis of TB in the region revealed frequent recent transmission of TB and pointed out significant shortcomings of the current concept for conventional contact tracing. The results presented also demonstrate that transmission of MDR TB in Belgrade is not optimally controlled, and they provide support for the development of improved control strategies, including application of molecular methods.

10.1002_ptr.1377	Activity against multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Mexican plants used to treat respiratory diseases	The increase of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) demands the search for alternative antimycobacterial drugs. The aim of this study was to evaluate plants used in Mexican traditional medicine to treat respiratory diseases for activity against MDR-TB. A group of 22 plants was screened for activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and Mycobacterium avium at concentrations from 50 to 200 mug/mL. The antimycobacterial effect was determined by a microcolorimetric assay with Alamar blue dye. None of the aqueous extracts had antimycobacterial activity. Hexane extracts from Artemisia ludoviciana, Chamaedora tepejilote, Lantana hispida, Juniperus communis and Malva parviflora, and methanol extracts from Artemisia ludoviciana and Juniperus communis inhibited the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mycobacterium avium was inhibited by Juniperus communis hexane extract and by Malva parviflora methanol extract. The active extracts were tested against monoresistant variants of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin and ethambutol resistant) and the hexane extract of Lantana hispida showed the best activity. Lantana hispida hexane extract was also active against a group of MDR-TB clinical isolates. In contrast, it did not inhibit the growth of non-tuberculous mycobacteria. The hexane extract of Lantana hispida was fractionated by column chromatography and one of its fractions (FVI) inhibited the growth of all the MDR-TB clinical isolates at concentrations up to 25 mug/mL. This study supports the fact that selecting plants by ethnobotanical criteria enhances the probability of finding species with activity against mycobacteria, and our results point to Lantana hispida as an important source of potential compounds against MDR-TB.

10.1016_S0924_9338_03_00091_9	Ciprofloxacin-induced acute psychosis in a patient with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Tuberculosis (TB) increasingly appears in a multidrug-resistant form (MDR-TB) in Europe, too. Treatment remains difficult due to various side effects of the multi-drug-regimens. Ciprofloxacin is widely used as one of the few TB-second-line drugs. We report on the course of a ciprofloxacin-induced acute psychosis in a patient with MDR(isoniazid, streptomycin)-TB which resolved after cessation of ciprofloxacin treatment and introduction of a novel oxazolidone. Careful treatment considerations particularly in patients with additional predisposing factors to neuropsychiatric symptoms are recommended in the potentially dangerous MDR-TB, thus creating an enormous therapeutic challenge.

pub-1944	Epidemiology and control of tuberculosis in Western European cities	SETTING: Major cities of Western Europe. OBJECTIVE: To describe major variations in the epidemiology and control of tuberculosis in large Western European Cities. DESIGN: Postal survey using contacts identified through the EURO-TB surveillance network. RESULTS: Twenty cities responded. In most cities, notification rates were substantially higher than national rates. Rates ranged from less than 10 per 100000 in Reykjavik and Belfast to over 70 per 100 000 in Lisbon. MDR-TB ranged from less than 1% of cases in many cities to over 5% in Rome and Milan. The proportion of patients estimated to be HIV-positive ranged from less than 5% in many countries to over 20% in Milan. These variations in epidemiology were accompanied by major variations in control policy, particularly in approaches to new entrant screening and BCG vaccination. CONCLUSION: In Western Europe, tuberculosis is primarily a problem of large cities. Some of these cities have very high rates of tuberculosis. There is little consensus about the best approaches to control. The evidence base for the effectiveness of different aspects of TB control needs to be strengthened.	tuberculosis; epidemiology; control; cities; Europe	NEW-YORK-CITY
10.1128_AAC.47.7.2231_2235.2003	Allele-specific rpoB PCR assays for detection of rifampin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum smears	We describe an allele-specific PCR assay to detect mutations in three codons of the rpoB gene (516, 526, and 531) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains; mutations in these codons are reported to account for majority of M. tuberculosis clinical isolates resistant to rifampin (RIF), a marker of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Three different allele-specific PCRs are carried out either directly with purified DNA (single-step multiplex allele-specific PCR), or with preamplified rpoB fragment (nested allele-specific PCR [NAS-PCR]). The method was optimized and validated following analysis of 36 strains with known rpoB sequence. A retrospective analysis of the 287 DNA preparations from epidemiologically unlinked RIF-resistant clinical strains from Russia, collected from 1996 to 2002, revealed that 247 (86.1%) of them harbored a mutation in one of the targeted rpoB codons. A prospective study of microscopy-positive consecutive sputum samples from new and chronic TB patients validated the method for direct analysis of DNA extracted from sputum smears. The potential of the NAS-PCR to control for false-negative results due to lack of amplification was proven especially useful in the study of these samples. The developed rpoB-PCR assay can be used in clinical laboratories to detect RIF-resistant and hence MDR M. tuberculosis in the regions with high burdens of the MDR-TB.

pub-1946	Clinical and programmatic considerations in the treatment of MDR-TB in children: a series of 16 patients from Lima, Peru	SETTING: Since 2000, the directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) strategy has been expanded in several countries to include treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). This strategy is known as DOTS-Plus. Tuberculosis is a common cause of morbidity and mortality for children throughout the developing world. Children may also be infected with MDR-TB, yet most developing countries do not specifically address pediatric MDR-TB. OBJECTIVE: To present the intermediate outcomes of the first 16 children enrolled in the Peruvian DOTS-Plus program and to demonstrate the tolerability of second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. RESULTS: Three children completed therapy and are cured, one child had bacteriologic and clinical failure after 12 months of therapy and died of respiratory insufficiency, and 12 have intermediate outcomes demonstrating favorable clinical, bacteriologic, and radiographic evidence of improvement after 9-19 months of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Of the 16 pediatric DOTS-Plus patients, 15 have tolerated therapy well and have had favorable clinical evolution. However, the diagnosis of pediatric MDR-TB is often extremely delayed due to reliance on the adult case definition and should be changed to prevent progressive, chronic illness in such children. Programmatic changes could facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment of pediatric MDR-TB in Peru and in other DOTS-Plus programs.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; children; DOTS	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS
pub-1947	Chronic cases of tuberculosis in Casablanca, Morocco	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence and patterns of drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates collected from patients with chronic tuberculosis in Casablanca, Morocco. METHODS: Between February 1996 and September 2001, 122 isolates were recovered from 112 different patients. The male to female ratio was 2.4. RESULTS: From February 1996 to May 1997, 77.5% of isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB), compared to 69.4% from February 1999 to May 2000 and 78.7% from June 2000 to September 2001. The prevalence of MDR-TB is similar from the initial to the last period of this study. Analysis of the 69 bp hypervariable region of the rpoB gene by DNA sequencing on 42 M. tuberculosis isolates (37 resistant, 5 sensitive) showed nine different types of mutations on codons rpoB 513, rpoB 516, rpoB 522, rpoB 523 and rpoB 526. A new point mutation was observed on codon rpoB 523 on one isolate. No mutation was detected on this rpoB region for four resistant isolates. CONCLUSION: The high rate of MDR-TB illustrates a serious problem. The public health authorities have introduced a new regimen protocol consisting of 3 months of kanamycin, ofloxacin, pyrazinamide and ethionamide, followed by 18 months of ofloxacin, pyrazinamide and ethionamide (3KOZEA/180ZEA) for this category of patients, and it is hoped that the additional use of ofloxacin during the intensive phase of treatment will reduce the rate of resistance.

10.1046_j.1365_2249.2003.02172.x	The production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha is decreased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients following stimulation with the 30-kDa antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis	The clearance of intracellular bacteria requires the appropriate induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines to recruit macrophages and T cells to the site of infection. In this study, we investigated the production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-8 and interferon (IFN)-gamma by the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in response to in vitro stimulation with the 30-kDa antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The results were compared with those from cases of newly diagnosed TB (N-TB) and TB with treatment failure (TF-TB), and healthy tuberculin reactors (HTR). The most significantly depressed TNF-alpha levels were found in MDR-TB patients. IFN-gamma production was depressed significantly in all groups of TB patients compared with the HTR group. TNF-alpha secretion in response to the 30-kDa antigen was unchanged by coculturing with recombinant human interferon (rhIFN)-gamma, and was increased dramatically following IL-10 neutralization with an anti-human IL-10 antibody. The IL-8 levels were depressed significantly in MDR-TB patients compared with N-TB patients, but were similar to the IL-8 levels in TF-TB patients. Furthermore, rhTNF-alpha directly increased IL-8 secretion, and neutralizing antibody to TNF-a inhibited IL-8 production by the PBMC of MDR-TB patients that were stimulated with the 30-kDa antigen. Taken together, these data suggest that the PBMC of MDR-TB patients typically show TNF-alpha depression in response to the 30-kDa antigen, and this effect is modulated by IL-10. In addition, we highlight the role of TNF-alpha in IL-8 secretion in MDR-TB patients.	interferon-gamma; interleukin-8; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; tumour necosis factor-alpha; 30-kDa antigen	ACTIVE PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; HOST IMMUNE-RESPONSE; CYTOKINE SECRETION; GENE-EXPRESSION; TNF-ALPHA; IFN-GAMMA; INFECTION; MONOCYTES; TRANSCRIPTION; INTERLEUKIN-4
pub-1949	Differential decline in tuberculosis incidence among US- and non-US-born persons in New York City	SETTING: A large urban tuberculosis control program. OBJECTIVES: To examine changes in tuberculosis incidence and characteristics of cases in New York City (NYC), and assess the epidemiology of tuberculosis among non-US-born persons. DESIGN: Tuberculosis surveillance data (1995-1999) for NYC were analyzed. RESULTS: Tuberculosis incidence decreased by 56.6% in US-born and 19.6% in non-US-born persons (age-adjusted) over the study period. The decline in tuberculosis incidence among US-born persons was more substantial in the first half of the study period (23-24%) than in the second half (13-15%). The greatest decline in incidence was among US-born Hispanic or Black males aged 25-64. However, although there was an SUMMARY overall decline in incidence among non-US-born persons, there was no significant change in any sex or racial/ethnic subgroup. The percent of multidrug-resistant (MDR) cases among non-US-born patients remained stable, but recent arrivals accounted for 79% of non-US-born MDR-TB patients in 1999, a significant increase from 16% in 1997. CONCLUSIONS: Continuing current tuberculosis control efforts and treatment of immigrants with latent tuberculosis infection are of highest priority for reducing incident cases in NYC. Global collaboration towards earlier detection and treatment of active tuberculosis cases in high incidence countries is also essential.	tuberculosis; incidence case rate; epidemiology; immigrants	ACTIVE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; UNITED-STATES; TRANSMISSION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; RUSSIA
pub-1950	Resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs among smear-positive cases in Thai prisons 2 years after the implementation of the DOTS strategy	SETTING: Three prisons in Bangkok and vicinity, Thailand. OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis among smear-positive cases in Thai prisons 2 years after the implementation of the DOTS strategy, and to identify factors associated with resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 154 consecutive tuberculosis patients with at least one positive sputum smear and at least one positive sputum culture registered between I May and 31 October 2000 were enrolled. Drug susceptibility testing was performed by the Ministry of Public Health Tuberculosis Division. Patient characteristics were obtained by face-to-face interview. RESULTS: Resistance to at least one drug was found in 50.6% of the subjects, including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in 19.5%. The proportion of resistance to any anti-tuberculosis drug in prisons A, B and C was respectively 52.7%, 37.8% and 61.5%. The only factor significantly associated with resistance to at least one drug (P = 0.011) and MDR-TB (P < 0.001) was a history of previous tuberculosis treatment. CONCLUSION: After 2 years of the DOTS strategy, resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs, an indicator of the quality of tuberculosis treatment, was found to be high. The DOTS strategy currently used in Thai prisons should be reviewed, in order to reduce and prevent drug-resistant tuberculosis.	drug resistance; tuberculosis; prisons; Thailand; DOTS	PREVALENCE
pub-1951	Para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) desensitization review in a case of multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis	SETTING: Tertiary care hospital in the Upper Midwest, United States. OBJECTIVE: Rapid desensitization to para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) in a patient with previous hypersensitivity reaction and a review of published PAS desensitization protocols. DESIGN: Composition and implementation of a short-course PAS desensitization protocol for a 34-year-old woman with multidrug-resistant (MDR) pulmonary tuberculosis, incorporating published experiences of PAS desensitization over the past 50 years. RESULTS: We composed a protocol and successfully desensitized our patient to PAS (Paser granules). By starting with a low dose (50 mg), then doubling the PAS SUMMARY dose on each successive day, our patient was able to tolerate full dose in 1 week. No steroids were required and no adverse reactions were encountered. Previous published PAS desensitization protocols used starting doses of 10-500 mg, desensitization time ranges from 7 to 54 days and commonly used steroids or corticotropin. CONCLUSION: Rapid desensitization to PAS can be successfully conducted within 1 week without the use of steroids or corticotropin. Given the limited number of drugs available for many patients with MDR-TB, desensitization to PAS is a valid alternative to drug discontinuation for patients with hypersensitivity reactions.	para-aminosalicylic acid; hypersensitivity; desensitization; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	ANTIMYCOBACTERIAL DRUGS
10.1086_374225	Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis during pregnancy: A report of 7 cases	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global public health problem affecting women of childbearing age. Little is known, however, about the safety of the drugs used to treat MDR-TB during pregnancy. We describe 7 patients who were treated for MDR-TB during pregnancy. These patients had chronic tuberculosis that had caused extensive parenchymal damage and had high-grade resistance to antituberculous drugs. All patients received individualized antituberculous therapy prior to delivery of healthy term infants. Neither obstetrical complications nor perinatal transmission of MDB-TB was observed. One patient experienced treatment failure, and another abandoned therapy. The other 5 patients are currently cured or in treatment and have culture-negative status. In each of these 7 cases, excellent treatment outcomes were obtained for the women and their children. Under certain circumstances, MDR-TB can be successfully treated during pregnancy.

10.1046_j.1469_0691.2003.00547.x	Treatment outcome of tuberculosis among Saudi nationals: role of drug resistance and compliance	Objective Recent studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of multiresistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Saudi Arabia. In this study, we assessed the impact of this and other factors on the treatment outcome of tuberculosis among Saudi nationals. Methods We studied all patients (147 patients) with a culture-proven diagnosis of tuberculosis seen at the King Khalid National Guard Hospital (KKNGH), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia from June 1993 to June 1999. Treatment outcome was classified as success or failure based on the clinical assessment, improvement or deterioration of chest X-rays, and results of follow-up sputum examination. Results Of the 147 patients, only 126 completed the follow-up program. Treatment was found to be successful in 102 (81.0%) and unsuccessful in 24 (19.0%) of these 126 patients. However, treatment success is much less (102/147; 69.4%) and failure is much higher (45/147; 30.6%) if the 21 patients who were lost to follow-up are regarded as treatment failures. The prevalence of poor compliance and multiply drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis were found to be significantly higher among those with treatment failure than among those in whom treatment was successful. There was no significant difference in treatment outcome between the different age groups. However, failure of treatment was observed to be more common (P < 0.001) among males (35 patients; 46.7%) than among females (10 patients; 13.9%). This could be explained mainly by the significantly higher prevalence of non-compliance among males (44%) than among females (15.3%). There were no significant differences in the symptoms, radiologic findings, clinical presentation (pulmonary versus extrapulmonary), social background or drug resistance between genders. Conclusion Successful treatment outcome among Saudi Nationals seen at the KKNGH in 1993-99 was below the rate recommended by the WHO, and failed treatment was associated with poor compliance, male gender and drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis . These results emphasize the importance of culture and sensitivity tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and close supervision of patients taking antituberculosis medications.

pub-1954	The role of the nurse in the community-based treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)	Setting: A community-based treatment program for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Lima, Peru. Objectives: To describe the activities carried out by the nurses working with the program. Design: A qualitative study using a variety of ethnographic methods, including participant observation, focus groups, and key informant interviews over a 5-year period. Results: Nurses were responsible for carrying out a wide variety of activities within the program. These included patient-focused activities such as identifying patients, evaluating patients prior to starting and during therapy, and managing emergencies; educational activities for both patients and health professionals managing MDR-TB; and coordination activities, including overseeing health workers and communicating between team members. Conclusion: Nurses play a key role in the community-based management of MDR-TB.	nurse; MDR-TB; community-based; tuberculosis	HEALTH; WOMEN
pub-1955	Peripheral neuropathy associated with treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Objective: To review the incidence and management of peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving therapy for MDR-TB. Methods: A case series with retrospective chart review of 75 patients who initiated individualized therapy for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Lima, Peru, between 1 August 1996 and 31 January 1999. Results: All patients had confirmed MDR-TB and were receiving individualized therapy, comprised of an average of six drugs. Ten (13%) of these patients presented with symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, confirmed by electromyography. All symptoms were reported in the lower extremities, and all were sensory in nature. Median time to presentation from initiation of MDR-TB therapy was 9.1 months. No significant risk factors associated with development of peripheral neuropathy were identified. Management strategies depended on the severity of symptoms and included the treatment of contributing co-morbidities, medications for neuropathic pain, and adjustment of doses of possible offending agents. All patients responded to management; three patients were left with mild residual symptoms. Patients whose neuropathy resolved had symptoms for a median of 7 months. Conclusions: Peripheral neuropathy was encountered in 13% of our cohort of MDR-TB patients. The diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy can be based on clinical presentation alone, and effective management of this side-effect is possible without sacrificing MDR-TB treatment efficacy.	peripheral neuropathy; MDR-TB; Peru; tuberculosis	ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS; FLUOROQUINOLONES; PYRIDOXINE; THERAPY
pub-1956	Multidrug-resistant tuberculous meningitis in patients with AIDS	We present clinical manifestations, bacteriologic characteristics, and outcomes for eight patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculous meningitis and AIDS. All developed meningitis as a terminal complication of previously diagnosed MDR-TB despite anti-tuberculosis therapy. Seven patients presented with fever, five with headache, four with altered mentation, two with focal deficits and one with seizures. CSF examination revealed pleocytosis, hypoglychorrhachia and elevated protein. Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin was isolated from all patients. Intracerebral mass lesions were detected in three patients, hydrocephalus in three, meningeal enhancement in five, and infarcts in two. Seven patients died 1-16 weeks after the diagnosis of meningitis; the eighth was lost to followup. MDR tuberculous meningitis is a difficult-to-treat infection with a high fatality rate.	tuberculosis; meningitis; HIV	HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM TUBERCULOSIS; INFECTION
10.1128_JCM.41.4.1520_1524.2003	Drug-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing genotype does not develop mutation-conferred resistance to rifampin at an elevated rate	The Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing genotype has drawn attention because it is often strongly associated with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). A possible reason is that the Beijing strains may have an enhanced capacity to develop drug resistance. In this study, we used the Luria-Delbruck fluctuation test to investigate whether strains of Beijing and non-Beijing genotypes exhibit differences in the acquisition of drug resistance. The M. tuberculosis reference strain H37Rv and 12 fully drug-susceptible clinical isolates, 6 of which were of the Beijing genotype, were examined. To determine the distribution of rifampin-resistant mutants, 25 independent cultures were made for each strain. The average mutation frequencies for the non-Beijing (H37Rv included) and Beijing genotypes were estimated to be 4.4x10(-8) and 3.6x10(-8), respectively. The corresponding average mutation rates for the non-Beijing and Beijing strains were 1.3x10(-8) and 1.1x10(-8) mutations per cell division, respectively. The results suggest that the association of the Beijing genotype with MDR-TB is not due to an altered ability to develop resistance.		SPREAD; STRAIN; FAMILY; COUNTRIES; OUTBREAK; RUSSIA
pub-1958	Pharmaceutical formulation of a fixed-dose anti-tuberculosis combination	SETTING: Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of the Witwatersrand. Despite the availability of highly effective treatment regimens for tuberculosis (TB), the cure rate still remains relatively low. This may be attributed to the high incidence of patient noncompliance, which subsequently leads to the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). To avoid the problem of further creation and propagation of MDR-TB, it may be proposed that patients should be given fixed-dose combinations of anti-tuberculosis drugs whenever self-administration is permitted. OBJECTIVE: To optimise an anti-tuberculosis extemporaneous powder formulation for suspension in order to develop a fixed combination of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol hydrochloride as a powder to be reconstituted with water by the patient prior to administration. METHODS: Different suspending agents were evaluated for their influence on powder flow properties, and sediment volume on the powder blends. Sodium starch glycolate was selected as the suspending agent because of its favourable powder flow properties and sediment volume produced. The dissolution characteristics of the extemporaneous powder for suspension were also compared to the dissolution profiles of commercially available anti-tuberculosis tablet dosage forms. RESULTS: The powder for suspension for rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol hydrochloride all compared favourably to the dissolution rate from the commercially available tablet dosage forms.	tuberculosis; patient non-compliance; fixed-dose multidrug combination; powder for suspension; dissolution studies	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; BIOAVAILABILITY; PYRAZINAMIDE; RIFAMPIN; OUTBREAK
10.1128_JCM.41.3.1101_1108.2003	Use of DNA extracts from Ziehl-Neelsen-stained slides for molecular detection of rifampin resistance and spoligotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Multidrug resistance among new cases of tuberculosis (TB) is increasingly becoming a significant problem in countries with a high prevalence of TB and with inadequate therapies for TB. Rifampin resistance is widely used as a marker for multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB; therefore, a new approach to the retrospective measurement of rifampin resistance without the need of a viable culture has been introduced. In many developing countries culture is unavailable and diagnosis relies on clinical manifestations and the results of Ziehl-Neelsen staining of sputum smears. We determined rifampin resistance directly with DNA extracts from Ziehl-Neelsen-stained slides by identification of mutations in the rpoB gene using reverse line blot hybridization and DNA sequencing. Analysis of the rpoB gene revealed that samples containing rifampin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis carried altered codons representing amino acid positions 516, 526, and 531 of the RNA polymerase. Although the sensitivities of both methods were equal (84%), sequencing of the rpoB gene was more accurate in identifying mutations in the core region of the rpoB gene. Sequence analysis of the rpoB gene in extracts from Ziehl-Neelsen-stained slides may be used to quantify more precisely the magnitude of MDR TB and, more importantly, provide information on trends in the development of resistance on a global scale. The nature of rifampin resistance and the genotype can be determined by analysis of Ziehl-Neelsen-stained slides in a laboratory equipped for sequencing and spoligotyping without the need to ship biohazardous materials.

pub-1960	Rapid detection of mutations in rpoB gene of rifampicin resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains by line probe assay	Background & objectives: Multidrug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) is a problem of increasing importance in the world due to limited treatment options. Resistance to rifampicin results from nucleotide changes in the gene encoding the 0 subunit of the RNA polymerase (rpoB) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Rifampicin resistance is considered as a marker for MDR TB. The nature and frequency of mutations in the rpoB gene of rifampicin resistant clinical isolates vary considerably according to the geographical location and very little information is available on specific mutational patterns in India. This study was undertaken to detect and characterize the rpoB gene mutation associated with rifampicin resistance in M. tuberculosis by line probe assay. Methods: A total of 36 strains of M. tuberculosis were analysed by INNO-LiPA Rif TB and compared with the results of conventional susceptibility testing method. After PCR amplification of the region of RNA polymerase involved in rifampicin resistance, the amplified product was hybridized with a set of 10 oligonucleotides immobilized onto a membrane strip. From the pattern obtained, the presence or absence of rifampicin resistance in the M. tuberculosis strains was assessed. Results: It was found that the M. tuberculosis probe was 100 per cent specific; the most frequently observed mutation was His-526-Tyr in the rpoB gene; and correlation between the results of the LiPA and those obtained by the classical susceptibility testing was excellent (100%). Interpretation & conclusion: INNO LiPA was found to be a reliable, simple, rapid and informative tool for the early detection and characterization of rpoB mutation associated with rifampicin resistance in M. tuberculosis in the clinical laboratory setting and may constitute an important molecular method for the control of tuberculosis.

10.1128_JCM.41.2.694_702.2003	Molecular characterization and drug resistance patterns of strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from patients in an AIDS counseling center in Port-au-Prince, Haiti: a 1-year study	Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most common opportunistic diseases that appear among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients in Haiti. In this context the probable emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is of great epidemiological concern. However, as routine culture of M. tuberculosis and drug susceptibility testing are not performed in Haiti, it has not been possible so far to evaluate the rate of drug resistance among M. tuberculosis isolates from circulating TB cases. This report describes the first study on the molecular typing and drug resistance of M. tuberculosis isolates from patients with culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis monitored at the GHESKIO Centers in Haiti during the year 2000. Clinical, epidemiological, and drug susceptibility testing results were available for 157 patients with confirmed cases of TB, with a total of 8.9% of patients harboring MDR M. tuberculosis. A significant association between the occurrence of resistance and previous TB treatment was observed (P < 0.001), suggesting that a previous history of TB treatment was a risk factor associated with MDR TB in Haiti. The DNAs of individual isolates from 106 samples were available and were typed by spoligotyping and determination of the variable number of tandem DNA repeats. Both typing methods provided interpretable results for 96 isolates, and the clusters observed were further confirmed by ligation-mediated PCR to define potential cases of active transmission. Thirty-three (34%) of the isolates were found to be grouped into 11 clusters with two or more identical patterns. However, an assessment of risk factors (sex, HIV positivity, previous treatment, drug resistance) showed that none was significantly associated with the active transmission of TB. These observations suggest that acquired MDR TB is prevalent in Haiti and may be associated with compliance issues during TB treatment since prior TB therapy is the strongest risk factor associated with MDR TB. Prevention of TB transmission in Haiti should target active case investigation, routine detection of drug resistance, and adequate treatment of patients. The use of directly observed short-course therapy should be enforced throughout the country; and relapses, reactivations, or newly acquired infections should be discriminated by genotyping methods.

10.1086_344657	Tuberculosis drug resistance: A global threat	Resistance to antituberculosis drugs has been a problem since the era of chemotherapy began. After dramatic outbreaks of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the early 1990s, resistance became recognized as a global problem. MDR-TB now threatens the inhabitants of countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. An understanding of the molecular basis of drug resistance may contribute to the development of new drugs. Management of MDR-TB relies on prompt recognition and treatment with at least 3 drugs to which an isolate is susceptible.

10.1056_NEJMoa022928	Community-based therapy for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Lima, Peru.	BACKGROUND: Despite the prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in nearly all low-income countries surveyed, effective therapy has been deemed too expensive and considered not to be feasible outside referral centers. We evaluated the results of community-based therapy for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in a poor section of Lima, Peru. METHODS: We describe the first 75 patients to receive ambulatory treatment with individualized regimens for chronic multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in northern Lima. We conducted a retrospective review of the charts of all patients enrolled in the program between August 1, 1996, and February 1, 1999, and identified predictors of poor outcomes. RESULTS: The infecting strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were resistant to a median of six drugs. Among the 66 patients who completed four or more months of therapy, 83 percent (55) were probably cured at the completion of treatment. Five of these 66 patients (8 percent) died while receiving therapy. Only one patient continued to have positive cultures after six months of treatment. All patients in whom treatment failed or who died had extensive bilateral pulmonary disease. In a multiple Cox proportional-hazards regression model, the predictors of the time to treatment failure or death were a low hematocrit (hazard ratio, 4.09; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.35 to 12.36) and a low body-mass index (hazard ratio, 3.23; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 11.53). Inclusion of pyrazinamide and ethambutol in the regimen (when susceptibility was confirmed) was associated with a favorable outcome (hazard ratio for treatment failure or death, 0.30; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.83). CONCLUSIONS: Community-based outpatient treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis can yield high cure rates even in resource-poor settings. Early initiation of appropriate therapy can preserve susceptibility to first-line drugs and improve treatment outcomes.

10.1053_rmed.2002.1412	Management of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis	There has been a worldwide increase in multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) which has in the past been associated with a poor prognosis. In the U.K., about half of the cases live in the London area and we have set out to obtain further information on their treatment and outcome. We examined the risk factors, drug resistance, drug treatment, sputum conversion, and outcome in patients with MDR-TB at three hospitals in South London and diagnosed during the period June 1995-January 1999 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-positive patients were excluded. There were 760 patients resident in Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham Health Authority (LSLHA) who were notified as tuberculosis (TB) during the time period and who were of negative or unknown HIV status. (The population of LSLHA is approx. 750 000) There was a total of 13 patients with MDR-TB, known or presumed to be HIV negative. Their median age was 28 years (range 15-53); nine (69%) were born outside the U.K. and 11 had pulmonary disease; they had organisms resistant to a median of two first-line drugs (range 2-4) and to a median of four of all drugs tested (range 2-10). They received treatment with a median of six drugs (range 3-9). Eight were followed up for at least 3 years (range 3-6) after the completion of treatment; at their last assessment none had features of active TB and all were sputum negative (smear and culture). Two returned to their countries of origin during treatment; they were sputum negative at that time. Two patients are well and continue on treatment in the U.K. One patient (known HIV negative) died following treatment failure. In conclusion, we obtained disease-free survival in eight cases of MDR-TB, known or presumed to be HIV negative and followed up for 3 years or more. The prognosis for patients treated at specialised centres is good (and better than is generally believed). We describe a new protocol for the detection and management of MDR-TB.

pub-1965	A low cost, home-made, reverse-line blot hybridisation assay for rapid detection of rifampicin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	SETTING: Cetrangolo Hospital, Vicente Lopez, Argentina, 1995-1999. OBJECTIVE: To describe a home-made reverse-line blot hybridisation assay for the detection of rifampicin resistance-associated mutations in the rpoB gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and to evaluate the usefulness of this rifampicin oligonucleotide, or 'RIFO' assay, to predict rifampicin resistance. DESIGN: A total of 135 M. tuberculosis isolates from the Cetrangolo Hospital were tested using the RIFO assay, the proportion method and the Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT 960). In addition, 120 drug-susceptible isolates from the Netherlands were included. RESULTS: The results obtained with the proportion method and the MGIT 960 system were in full agreement. In the RIFO assay, 90 of the 97 rifampicin-resistant isolates were correctly identified (sensitivity 92.8%, positive predictive value 100%). All of the drug-susceptible isolates were correctly predicted by the RIFO assay. CONCLUSIONS: With this home-made molecular test, rifampicin resistance in M. tuberculosis can be predicted in colonies isolated in culture in only 1 day, and can therefore shorten the laboratory turn around time for rifampicin susceptibility testing by weeks. In principle the test can also be applied directly to Ziehl-Neelsen slides and clinical material, as has been demonstrated for another reverse-line blot-based assay for M. tuberculosis, spoligotyping.	tuberculosis; PCR; reverse-line blot hybridisation; rifampicin; resistance; MDR-TB	STRAND CONFORMATION POLYMORPHISM; RPOB GENE; SPECIES IDENTIFICATION; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; GENOTYPIC DETECTION; MUTATIONS; INFECTION; STRAINS; COMPLEX; ARRAYS
pub-1966	Prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis among HIV-infected persons in a home care program in Phnom Penh, Cambodia	SETTING: Phnom Penh, Cambodia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the burden of active pulmonary tuberculosis among an HIV-infected cohort and the proportion of drug-resistant strains, using active case-finding adapted to a home care setting. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. Measures include the prevalence of culture-confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis, utilizing a single spot sputum specimen; the proportion of pulmonary TB, detected and undetected; proportion of cases resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, streptomycin; and the diagnostic value of symptoms. RESULTS: Of 441 persons surveyed, 41 (9%) had active pulmonary TB by culture; 29 were smear-positive (71%), and only one case was on treatment. The total burden of pulmonary TB was 12% (54/441), with a ratio of undetected to detected cases of 3:1. Primary isoniazid resistance was detected in six new cases (15%); no MDR-TB was identified. Symptoms were not predictive of active pulmonary disease. Mortality was high among those not surveyed (20%) and those found to have TB (49%). CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis is epidemic in this HIV-infected population. Active case-finding yielded three times the number of cases already detected and should be considered where resources allow. However, effective passive case detection and improved coordination of TB and HIV care programs are required to address HIV-associated TB morbidity and mortality.

10.1046_j.1365_3156.2002.00960.x	Increasing transparency in partnerships for health - introducing the Green Light Committee	Public-private partnerships have become central to efforts to combat infectious diseases. The characteristics of specific partnerships, their governance structures, and their ability to effectively address the issues for which they are developed are being clarified as experience is gained. In an attempt to promote access to and rational use of second-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs for the treatment of multidrug-resistant TB, a unique partnership known as the Green Light Committee (GLC) was established by the World Health Organization. This partnership relies on five categories of actors to achieve its goal: academic institutions, civil society organizations, bilateral donors, governments of resource-limited countries, and a specialized United Nations agency. While the for-profit private sector is involved in terms of supplying concessionally priced drugs it is excluded from decision-making. The effectiveness of the partnership emerges from its review process, flexibility to modify its modus operandi to overcome obstacles, independence from the commercial sector, and its ability to link access, rational use, technical assistance, and policy development. The GLC mechanism may be useful in the development of other partnerships needed in the rational allocation of resources and tools for combating additional infectious diseases.

10.1002_j.1875_595X.2002.tb00880.x	Re-emergence of tuberculosis and its variants: implications for dentistry	Tuberculosis is one of the deadliest scourges of mankind and, overall, one third of the global population is infected with this mycobacterium or its variants. The advent of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic has accelerated its spread inexorably whilst the multi-drug resistant strains of the bacillus have hampered disease management. Given the alarming spread of the disease, there appears to be a significant potential for occupationally acquired tuberculous infection amongst health care workers, including dental care workers. This review addresses the basic microbiology and the pathogenesis of tuberculosis, its oral manifestations, mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT), multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), management including aspects of the global programme on tuberculosis (DOTS programme), the potential for occupationally acquiring the disease and finally, the infection control measures that are available for dental and other health care workers.	tuberculosis; emerging diseases; dentistry; DOTS; MDR-TB; MOTT	BCG
pub-1969	Frequency of recurrence among MDR-TB cases 'successfully' treated with standardised short-course chemotherapy	SETTING: Ivanovo Oblast, Russian Federation, 300 km north-east of Moscow, where a pilot DOTS TB control programme was implemented in October 1995. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of TB recurrence among MDR (multidrug-resistant) patients who achieved treatment 'success' on standard short-course chemotherapy. METHODS: All patients with MDR tuberculosis, defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, who were declared 'cured' or 'treatment completed', were identified using the district register and traced whenever possible. Eligible patients underwent medical examination and, if necessary, chest radiography, sputum smear examination, culture and susceptibility testing. If the patient had died, the relatives were interviewed to try to determine the reasons for death. RESULTS: Of 18 patients eligible for analysis, five (27.8%) were documented to have recurrence (two of seven patients resistant to HRSE, one of five patients resistant to HRS and two of six patients resistant to HR). Patients receiving the Category I regimen were more likely to relapse than those receiving the Category 11 regimen (40% vs. 12.5%). The median time to relapse was 8 months; 2.46 recurrences were observed in 100 person-months (3.17 in category I and 1.3 in Category H patients). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of TB recurrence among MDR-TB patients declared 'cured' after short-course chemotherapy is high. Improvements in treatment success, after removal of programme-related pitfalls in the treatment delivery process, must incorporate methods for early detection of MDR, along with adequate treatment regimens including second-line drugs. Culture-based bacteriological confirmation at the end of treatment is recommended.	tuberculosis; MDR; recurrence; Russia	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; TREATMENT FAILURE; EUROPE; COUNTRIES; RIFAMPIN; NEED
pub-1970	Anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in community and prison patients, Orel Oblast, Russian Federation	SETTING: Orel Oblast, Russian Federation. OBJECTIVES: To determine baseline levels of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in Orel Oblast. DESIGN : Drug susceptibility testing(DST) records from I July 1999 to 30 June 2000 for patients with sputum acid-fast bacilli smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis were reviewed. Treatment and incarceration status were obtained from the tuberculosis register. Patients with I month or less of prior treatment were defined as new cases; those previously treated for more than 1 month were defined as retreatment cases. RESULTS: Of 246 smear-positive isolates, 212 (86%) had DST performed. Of these, 190 (90%) were from new and 22 (10%) from retreatment cases; 171 (81%) were from community and 41 (19%) were from prison patients. Any drug resistance was more common among prison than community patients (44% vs. 30%, P = 0.05). MDR-TB was found in 14 (6.6%) of 212 isolates, and was more prevalent in prison compared with community patients (12% vs. 5%, P = 0.05). Retreatment cases were more likely than new cases to have MDR-TB (prevalence ratio [PR] = 8.5, 95%CI = 3.3-22.3), although the PR was higher for prison than for community retreatment cases (10.0 vs. 5.8). CONCLUSIONS: New cases with MDR-TB were less prevalent in Orel Oblast compared with other survey sites in Russia. Any drug resistance and MDR-TB were associated with prior treatment, especially in the prison population. Continued monitoring of trends in drug resistance following DOTS implementation is needed.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; surveillance; Russia	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DOTS-PLUS
pub-1971	Efficacy of common antiseptics against multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis	OBJECTIVES: The incidence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has been increasing. Antiseptics are frequently used to prevent mycobacterial infection. The aim of this study was to determine those antiseptics that are useful against MDR-TB. DESIGN: We evaluated bactericidal activity against clinical isolates of MDR-TB in vitro. METHOD: Thirteen strains of MDR-TB were tested against povidone-iodine (PVP-I), cresol, akyldiamino-ethyl glycine hydrocloride (AEG), and glutaraldehyde. After bacilli were exposed to the antiseptic solution with 2% human serum, the disinfectant was inactivated by addition of neutraliser. RESULTS: PVP-I at a final concentration of 0.2% killed all of the strains within 120 seconds, and PVP-I at 0.1% killed 99.9% or more bacilli within 60 seconds. Most strains were killed after exposure to 0.5% cresol at 300 seconds and to 1.0% cresol at 60 seconds; 3.0% cresol killed all bacilli within 120 seconds, while 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.5% AEG all required 60 minutes to kill 99.9% or more of the bacilli; 2.0% glutaraldehyde required 10 minutes to kill all bacilli. CONCLUSION: The bactericidal activities of antiseptics for MDR-TB were similar to those for drug-sensitive M. tuberculosis strains. PVP-I would be a useful antiseptic against MDR-TB. The bactericidal activities of glutaraldehyde are effective against MDR-TB as an antiseptic for medical equipment.	mycobactericidal activities; povidone-iodine (PVP-I); multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB); antiseptics	HEALTH-CARE WORKERS; NEW-YORK-CITY; NOSOCOMIAL TRANSMISSION; ALKALINE GLUTARALDEHYDE; ENDOSCOPY UNITS; APIC GUIDELINE; DISINFECTANTS; OUTBREAK; BRONCHOSCOPE; DERMATITIS
pub-1972	Risk factors associated with default, failure and death among tuberculosis patients treated in a DOTS programme in Tiruvallur District, South India, 2000	OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors associated with default, failure and death among tuberculosis patients treated in a newly implemented DOTS programme in South India. DESIGN: Analysis of all patients registered from May 1999 through April 2000. A community survey for active tuberculosis was underway in the area; patients identified in the community survey were also treated in this programme. RESULTS: In all, 676 patients were registered during the period of the study. Among new smear-positive patients (n = 295), 74% were cured, 17% defaulted, 5% died and 4% failed treatment. In multivariate analysis (n = 676), higher default rates were associated with irregular treatment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 4.3; 95%CI 2.5-7.4), being male (AOR 3.4; 95%CI 1.5-8.2), history of previous treatment (AOR 2.8; 95%CI 1.6-4.9), alcoholism (AOR 2.2; 95%CI 1.3-3.6), and diagnosis by community survey (AOR 2.1; 95%CI 1.2-3.6). Patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were more likely to fail treatment (33% vs. 3%; P < 0.001). More than half of the patients receiving Category 11 treatment who remained sputum-positive after 3 or 4 months of treatment had MDR-TB, and a large proportion of these patients failed treatment. Higher death rates were independently associated with weight <35 kg (AOR 3.8; 95%CI 1.9-7.8) and history of previous treatment (AOR 3.3; 95%CI 1.5-7.0). CONCLUSIONS: During this first year of DOTS implementation with sub-optimal performance, high rates of default and death were responsible for low cure rates. Male patients and those with alcoholism were at increased risk of default, as were patients identified by community survey. To prevent default, directly observed treatment should be made more convenient for patients. To reduce mortality, the possible role of nutritional interventions should be explored among underweight patients.	tuberculosis; default; failure; death; DOTS; risk factors	POSITIVE PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; NEW-YORK-CITY; CHEMOTHERAPY; PREDICTORS; ADHERENCE; MORTALITY; RESISTANT; IMPACT

pub-1974	Should tuberculosis programmes invest in second-line treatments for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)?			
10.1183_09031936.02.00401302	Strategies against multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	"The rise of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), defined as tuberculosis showing resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, is a serious threat to tuberculosis control in some high prevalence countries and may have some impact on low prevalence regions as well. The World Health Organization estimates that 50 million people worldwide are infected with MDR-TB, and that, in the year 2000, 273,000 (3.1%) MDR-TB cases were among the 8.7 million new tuberculosis cases. In 1998, the highest MDR-TB rates among new cases and the highest combined (new and previously treated cases) MDR-TB rates were found in Estonia (14.1 and 18.1%.), Henan province in China (10.8 and 15.1%), Latvia (9.0 and 12.0%), and Ivanovo Oblast (9.0 and 12.3%) and Tomsk Oblast (6.5 and 13.7%) in the Russian Federation. The risk factors for NIDR-TB are previous treatment or relapse, originating from ""hot spot"" areas, a history of imprisonment, homelessness and possibly also human immunodeficiency virus. The treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is difficult due to side-effects and a treatment duration of up to 3 yrs, which is expensive and often unsuccessful. Therefore, strategies for the treatment and prevention of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis are urgently required. This requires functioning tuberculosis control programmes (directly observed treatment short course), and, in some high prevalence countries, the introduction of second-line drugs on the basis of appropriate susceptibility testing (directly observed treatment short course-Plus). Only the future will show whether this ""ticking time bomb"" can be defused."	control programmes; epidemiology; multidrug resistance; outcome; treatment; tuberculosis	SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; NEW-YORK-CITY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; MDR-TB; MANAGEMENT; RESECTION; COUNTRIES; NEED
pub-1976	Influence of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance on the treatment outcome of pulmonary tuberculosis patients receiving DOTS in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia	OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance existing prior to treatment on the outcome of pulmonary tuberculosis patients receiving standard short-course chemotherapy (SCC) under direct observation under national programme guidelines. DESIGN: Treatment outcomes of sputum smear- and culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients admitted consecutively from 1998 through 1999 in a referral hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 515 patients were reviewed; 139 patients were deported or transferred out. Treatment outcomes and follow-up for about 2 years were analysed for the remaining 376 patients. Among 315 patients with sensitive isolates, 301 achieved favourable outcome, none relapsed or failed, 10 defaulted, one died and three were lost to follow-up at 6 months. Mono-resistance to isoniazid, streptomycin or ethambutol did not influence the treatment outcome. All the 18 patients with mono-resistance to rifampicin were cured, but two relapsed later. Among 39 patients with any rifampicin resistance, 37 patients had favourable outcome and two failed treatment; three later relapsed. Among eight patients with MDR-TB, six had favourable outcome and two failed treatment; one later relapsed. Sputum smear conversion rates at the end of 3 months of treatment in patients with any rifampicin resistance or with multidrug resistance were inferior to those of patients with sensitive strains (89.8% vs. 96.3%, P = 0.016 and 80% vs. 96.3%, P = 0.008, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Anti-tuberculosis drug resistance existing prior to treatment, especially rifampicin and multidrug resistance, has an adverse effect on treatment outcome, even with directly observed standard SCC under national programme guidelines.	pulmonary tuberculosis; drug resistance; treatment outcome	SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS
10.1016_S0035_9203_02_90383_4	Impact of resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs on treatment outcome using World Health Organization standard regimens	We compared treatment outcome in 410 patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB) and 150 patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) among 560 adult patients (greater than or equal to15 years old) notified with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis between July 1997 and June 1998 in the West Province of Cameroon and treated with World Health Organization (WHO) standard regimens under field conditions. Information on treatment outcome was collected for all smear-positive TB patients having a positive culture with drug susceptibility tests performed for isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin. Treatment outcome was recorded as cured, completed treatment, failed, defaulted, died or transferred out. 332 of the 410 patients (81%) with DS-TB were cured, compared to 109/150 (72(.)7%) patients with DR-TB (odds ratio [OR] = 0(.)62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0(.)40-0(.)99). Seven patients (1(.)7%) failed treatment in the DS-TB group vs. 9 (6(.)0%) in the DR-TB group (OR = 3(.)67, 95% CI 1(.)23-11(.)18). No significant difference was found in rates of death, default or transfer. Sputum smear conversion at the end of the intensive treatment phase was observed in 78-8% of the cases, drug resistance having no effect on the conversion rate. After adjusting for age, sex and resistance, the death rate was higher in patients also infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In TB cases with multidrug resistance, standard regimens result in unacceptably high failure rates (26(.)1%). For all other drug-resistant forms of TB, rifampicin-based short-course chemotherapy gave satisfactory results. The death toll in the West Province seems due to HIV co-infection rather than to TB alone. To prevent development of drug-resistance, the proportion of defaulters must be decreased and prevention and control strategies endorsed by the WHO and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease must be implemented nation-wide.	tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; chemotherapy; drug resistance; treatment outcome; Cameroon	DOTS-PLUS; MDR-TB
pub-1978	Surveillance of drug resistance in tuberculosis in two districts of South India	SETTING: Tuberculosis Research Centre, Chennai, India. OBJECTIVES: To determine the levels of drug resistance in new and previously treated cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in the composite districts of North Arcot (Tamil Nadu State) and Raichur (Karnataka State) in South India. DESIGN: Two specimens of sputum from 320 patients attending 23 participating centres in North Arcot district and 314 patients from 20 participating centres in Raichur district were tested for drug susceptibility to isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R), ethambutol (E), streptomycin (S) and ofloxacin (O). The studies were undertaken using the guidelines prescribed by the WHO/IUATLD Working Group on Anti-tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance. RESULTS: In North Arcot district, resistance to any drug tested was found in 27.7% of new cases; any H resistance in 23.4%, any R resistance in 2.8% and multidrug resistance (resistance to at least H and R: MDR) in 2.8%. In previously treated cases, resistance to any drug was observed in 81.2%, and any resistance to H, R and HR in 81%, 69% and 69%, respectively. In Ralchur district, resistance to any drug was observed in 21.9% of new cases; any resistance to H, R and HR (MDR) was found in 18.7%, 2.5% and 2.5%, respectively. All previously treated patients were resistant to H and R (100%). CONCLUSION: In North Arcot district, the proportion of MDR-TB in newly diagnosed patients has marginally increased over the last 10-15 years, whereas it has remained fairly constant in Raichur district. An increase in resistance was noted in previously treated cases in both districts, although the numbers of patients are small.	pulmonary tuberculosis; drug resistance; two districts; South India	CHEMOTHERAPY; PROGRAM
pub-1979	Rapid indication of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis from liquid cultures using FASTPlaqueTB-RIFTM, a manual phage-based test	SETTING: A Mycobacteriology Reference Laboratory in Johannesburg, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To determine the ability of FASTPlaqueTB-RIF(TM), a rapid bacteriophage-based test, to correctly identify rifampicin susceptibility in clinical strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis after growth in the Bactec 460 semi-automated liquid culture system. DESIGN: A comparative study of FASTPlaqueTB-RIF(TM) and conventional drug susceptibility methods, with selection bias to include sufficient rifampicin-resistant strains. RESULTS: Rifampicin susceptibility results were available for 133 strains of M. tuberculosis. Using the Bactec 460 method, 42 of these strains were rifampicin-resistant and 91 strains were rifampicin-susceptible. A further one strain was found to have a mutation in the rpoB gene which was strongly indicative of rifampicin resistance. Sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy for the FASTPlaqueTB-RIF(TM) were respectively 100%, 98.8% and 99.2% for detection of rifampicin resistance; 95.3% (41/43) of the rifampicin-resistant strains were also resistant to isomazid (multidrug-resistant). CONCLUSION: FASTPlaqueTB-RIF(TM) offers pcrformance comparable to the Bactec 460 method, with results available within 2 days and without the need for specialised equipment., This makes FASTPlaqueTB-RIF (TM) a rapid test for rifampicin resistance suitable for widespread application. A combination of the FASTPlaqueTB-RIF(TM) test with semi-automated liquid culture reduces the time required to report susceptibility results, enabling rapid and affropriate management of patients with MDR-TB. Rifampicin resistance was a good predictor of multidrug resistance in this population.	rifampicin; mycobacteriophage; drug susceptibility test; tuberculosis; multidrug resistance	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; RIFAMPIN RESISTANCE; SUSCEPTIBILITY; STREPTOMYCIN; INFECTION; BACILLI; ASSAY
10.1053_jinf.2001.0992	Molecular analysis of clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis collected from patients with persistent disease in the Khartoum region of Sudan	Setting: Patients with positive smears for acid-fast bacilli were enrolled at tuberculosis (TB) clinics in the Khartoum region of Sudan. Objective: To identify the presence of drug resistant genotypes in M. tuberculosis isolates which are difficult to treat. Methods: Genus specific PCR-SSCP was performed to confirm the presence of M. tuberculosis in clinical isolates. Genotypic drug resistance testing was performed by mutation analysis and spoligotyping was used to monitor transmission and to identify epidemic strains. Results: Fifty (48%) of the original 105 samples were classified as M. tuberculosis. Four (4%) of the samples were typed as mycobacteria other than TB, while the remaining (n=50) samples were refractory to further molecular analysis. The fifty amplifiable M. tuberculosis samples were used for subsequent mutation analysis and typing. Mutations were identified in the genes conferring resistance to INH (katG, 12%), RIF (rpoB, 8%), SM (rpsL and rrs, 30%) and EMB (embB, 4%). Two of the samples (4%) had mutations in genes associated to both INH and RIF and can be classified as MDR-TB. Thirty-three percent (13/39) of the persistant tuberculosis cases (5/18 treatment failure; 5/14 relapse; 3/7 defaulter) had mutations accounting for drug resistance. A total of 27 different spoligotypes were identified from 49/50 samples. Twenty-nine (59%) of the isolates were grouped into one of seven clusters, while 20 (41%) showed unique patterns. One patient was infected with M. bovis. Conclusion: This is the first molecular approach to characterize clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis from Sudan. The results show that drug resistance is indeed a serious problem and it may compliment the efforts of the National Tuberculosis Programme to improve strategies to control this disease.

10.1542_peds.109.5.765	Evaluation of young children in contact with adult multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis: A 30-month follow-up	Setting. The Western Cape Province of South Africa, an area with a high tuberculosis (TB) incidence, where initial multidrug resistance (MDR) among adult TB cases was 1.1% during 1992-1993. Objective. To determine the long-term prevalence of TB infection and disease in children in household contact with adults with MDR pulmonary TB, and to establish the efficacy of chemoprophylaxis in preventing disease in these children. Method. Children <5 years old in contact with 73 MDR TB adults were evaluated. Disease was treated by prescribing at least 2 drugs to which the adult's strain was susceptible. The remaining children were classified as infected or noninfected and received chemoprophylaxis according to the index's strain susceptibility or were followed up and treated when indicated. All were followed up for 30 months. Results. At the initial evaluation 125 children were seen, median age 27.5 months. Of these, 119 were followed up. Fourteen (12%) had disease, 61 (51%) were infected only, and 44 (37%) were noninfected. By 30-month follow-up, 29 (24%) had developed disease and 64 (54%) were infected only. Four adult-child pair Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were compared by DNA fingerprinting; 3 were identical. All children who developed TB disease were clinically cured. Two (5%) of 41 children who received appropriate chemoprophylaxis and 13 (20%) of 64 who did not, developed TB during follow-up (odds ratio: 4.97). Conclusion. The study confirms MDR TB transmission to childhood contacts. Seventy-eight percent of children were infected or developed disease. Appropriate chemoprophylaxis may prevent disease in these children.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant; children; contacts; follow-up; chemoprophylaxis	EARLY BACTERICIDAL ACTIVITY; DRUG-RESISTANT; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; CIPROFLOXACIN; TRANSMISSION; ETHAMBUTOL; PEDIATRICS; EXPERIENCE; QUINOLONES; HOUSEHOLD
10.1016_S0923_2508_02_01311_6	Molecular characterization of multiple-drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from northwestern Russia and analysis of rifampin resistance using RNA/RNA mismatch analysis as compared to the line probe assay and sequencing of the rpoB gene	This investigation evaluated the potential of RNA/RNA mismatch analysis for the detection of rifampin resistance among 38 multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from northwestern Russia. The results obtained were compared with a commercialized line probe assay and rpoB sequencing, and the genetic diversity of the isolates was also investigated in parallel using spoligotyping and variable number of tandem DNA repeats (VNTR). The mismatch analysis revealed 3 distinct RNA cleavage profiles permitting the subdivision of the strains into mutation groups I to 3, the most common being group 1 (28 of 38 isolates) that contained a majority of strains with a TCG531>TTG (Ser-->Leu) mutation, followed by group 2 (6 of 38 isolates) characterized by different mutations in the codon CAC526 (His), and group 3 (4 of 38 isolates), all characterized by a GAC516(Asp) mutation. Spoligotyping revealed the Beijing type to be the most prevalent among mismatch group 1 (24 out of 28 strains), suggesting that the most frequent rpoB mutation among the Beijing family in our setting was TCG531>TTG (Ser-->Leu). All the Beijing type isolates were also characterized by a unique VNTR pattern made up of exact tandem repeats (ETR)-A to E of 42435. We conclude that the Beijing genotype constitutes the major family of MDR-TB isolates currently circulating in northwestern Russia, and that the in-house RNA/RNA mismatch analysis may be successfully used for rapid and reliable diagnosis of rifampin-resistant tuberculosis in this setting.

10.1086_339818	Worldwide incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Planning for tuberculosis (TB) control requires an assessment of the number and distribution of drug-resistant cases. This study used results of resistance surveys from 64 countries, together with data predictive of resistance rates from 72 others, to estimate the number of new multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB cases that occurred in 2000. By these methods, an estimated 273,000 (95% confidence limits, 185, 000 and 414, 000) new cases of MDR TB occurred worldwide in 2000, 3.2% of all new TB cases. The analysis provides the first comprehensive set of estimates of the MDR TB burden by country and globally.		
pub-1984	A retrospective study for the outcome of pulmonary resection in 49 patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	BACKGROUND: Outcome of treatment using only chemotherapy for multi drug-resistant tuberculosis is usually considered not to be satisfactory. The combination of chemotherapy with surgical treatment has been producing higher acid-fast bacilli (AFB) negative sputum conversion and longer survival rates. This treatment strategy may be the solution for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of the medical records and laboratory findings of 49 patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among 130 patients who underwent pulmonary resection for pulmonary tuberculosis between January 1995 and December 1999 at National Masan Tuberculosis Hospital, Korea. RESULTS: The mean number of drugs to which the patients were resistant was 4.5. Patients had a mean age of 35 years. Cavitary lesions on plain chest X-ray were shown in 43/49 patients (87.8%); 31 had positive sputum cultures preoperatively (63.3%). The surgical techniques used were as follows: 12 pneumonectomies, 28 lobectomies, seven lobectomies with segmentectomies or wedge resections, one wedge resection and one cavernoplasty. The AFB negative sputum conversion rate was 93.5% with continuous postoperative chemotherapy. There were no deaths after surgery. Postoperative complications that developed were six cases of air leakage over a week, one of postoperative bleeding and one of wound infection. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the effectiveness of pulmonary resection with postoperative chemotherapy in cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Although there are different ideas about indications for surgery and the length and content of postoperative drug regimens, pulmonary resection should be considered an effective measure in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis.

10.1179_joc.2002.14.1.33	A 10-year survey of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in pavia and their drug resistance: a comparison with other Italian reports	A retrospective review was made of the bacteriological and medical records of patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis who attended the IRCCS San Matteo Polyclinic of Pavia, between 1990 and 2000. Altogether, 279 patients were included in the survey: 220 new cases and 59 prior treatment cases. Resistance to at least one drug, and resistance to both isoniazid and rifampicin (MDR) were more common among previously treated patients than among new cases (86.4% vs. 34.1%, and 44% vs. 5.9%, respectively). While the frequency of resistance to any drug showed no variation in the period examined, a trend toward a progressive decrease in the frequency of primary MDR-TB was observed (from 11.9% in 1990-1992 to 1.3% in 1998-2000). The level of resistance observed in our study suggests that all isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis should be tested for drug susceptibility, especially when obtained from patients who report a previous episode of the disease.

pub-1986	Controlling multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and access to expensive drugs: a rational framework	The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), i.e. involving resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, could threaten the control of TB globally. Controversy has emerged about the best way of confronting MDR-TB in settings with very limited resources. In 1999, the World Health Organization (WHO) created a Working group on DOTS-Plus, an initiative exploring the programmatic feasibility and cost-effectiveness of treating MDR-TB in low-income and middle-income countries, in order to consider the management of MDR-TB under programme conditions. The challenges of implementation have proved more daunting than those of access to second-line drugs, the prices of which are dropping. Using data from the WHO/International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease surveillance project, we have grouped countries according to the proportion of TB patients completing treatment successfully and the level of MDR-TB among previously., untreated patients. The resulting matrix provides a reasonable framework for. deciding whether to use second-line drugs in a national programme. Countries in which the treatment success rate, i.e. the proportion of new patients Who complete the scheduled treatment, irrespective of whether bacteriological cure is documented, is below 70% should give the highest priority to introducing or improving DOTS, the five-point TB control strategy recommended by WHO and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. A poorly functioning programme can create MDR-TB much faster than it can be treated, even if,unlimited resources are available. There is no single prescription for controlling MDR-TB but the various tools available should be applied wisely. Firstly, good DOTS and infection control; then appropriate use of second-line drug treatment. The interval,between the two depends on the local context and resources. AS funds are allocated to treat MDR-TB, human and financial resources should be increased to expand DOTS worldwide.	tuberculosis, multidrug-resistant, drug therapy, epidemiology, history; antitubercular agents, therapeutic use, economic; treatment outcome; developing countries	NEW-YORK-CITY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MORTALITY; THERAPY; INFECTION; HEALTH; ERA

10.7861_clinmedicine.2_1_55	Tuberculosis - a missed opportunity?	The recent publicity surrounding tuberculosis (TB) in both the medical and the lay press, particularly in reference to a number of outbreaks of the disease in British schools, is a timely reminder of a 'forgotten' disease that has never really gone away. Following a marked decrease in notification rates in developed counties in the 1960s and 1970s, TB control and treatment programmes were downgraded in the West, and soon both medical professionals and the lay public ceased to be able to identify early symptoms of the infection. Meanwhile, poorer countries continued to struggle to provide even basic medical resources, and death and sickness from TB continued unchecked. More recently, however, there has been a rise in the number of new cases of TB in industrialised nations, together with the emergence of multi-drug-resistant strains of the bacillus. This article reviews these and other aspects of the effectiveness of both UK and international TB control programmes.	tuberculosis (TB); multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB); active disease; infection; national TB programme; professional awareness; public awareness; stigma; directly observed therapy (DOTS); costs	DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; EPIDEMIOLOGY

pub-1990	Ambulatory treatment of multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis patients at a chest clinic	SETTING: Retrospective cohort analysis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients treated at a Korean National Tuberculosis Association out-patient chest clinic. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate treatment outcomes and contributing factors. DESIGN. A review of clinical records of 1011 pulmonary MDR-TB patients retreated with individualised regimens selected on the basis of previous chemotherapy and drug susceptibility testing from 1988 to 1996. RESULTS: The patients (mean age 38.6 years) had resistant organisms to an average of 3.7 drugs and were retreated with an average of 4.2 drugs which they had previously not taken and to which they were susceptible. Treatment outcomes were as follows: 487 cases (48.2%) cured, 82 (8.1%) failed, 394 (39.0%) defaulted, 45 (4.5%) transferred out, and three (0.3%) died. The treatment efficacy among those who completed chemotherapy was 85.6%. In a multivariate analysis favourable response was significantly associated with a greater number of newly prescribed drugs in the regimen to which they were susceptible (odds ratio [OR] 3.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-9.5), younger age (OR 2.0; 95%CI 1.1-3.9), and a lower number of drugs to which they were resistant (OR 1.8; 95%CI 1.1-3.1). The case fatality rate, including the follow-up period, was 1.7% (17 cases). CONCLUSION: The cure rate of MDR-TB patients treated at an out-patient clinic was 48.2% due to a high defaulter rate (39.0%). However, 85.6% of those who completed treatment were cured.

10.1378_chest.120.5.1514	Increased incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in diabetic patients on the Bellevue Chest Service, 1987 to 1997	Study objectives: To investigate the characteristics of tuberculosis infection in diabetic patients at Bellevue Hospital. Design: We conducted a case-control study retrospectively reviewing the records of patients at Bellevue Hospital Center from 1987 to 1997 with a discharge diagnosis of tuberculosis and diabetes mellitus. Setting: Bellevue Hospital Center is a 1,200-bed, inner-city municipal hospital located in the Lower East Side of New York City. Patients: Fifty-three identified patients had verified tuberculosis infection and diabetes; of these, 50 charts were available for review. One hundred five control cases were selected from nondiabetic patients with a discharge diagnosis of tuberculosis during the same time period. Measurements and results: Thirty-six percent (18 cases) of the patients with diabetes and tuberculosis had multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) compared to only 10% (10 cases) in the control group (p<0.01) Controlling for homelessness, HIV status, and directly observed therapy, the relative risk of MDR-TB was calculated to be 8.6 (confidence interval, 3.1 to 23.6) in the diabetic group compared to the control group. Conclusions: There was a significant association between diabetes and MDR-TB. Diabetes continues to be a risk factor for tuberculosis and was associated with MDR-TB in our patients.	diabetes mellitus; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	NEW-YORK-CITY; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS
pub-1992	Determinants of drug-resistant tuberculosis: analysis of 11 countries	SETTING: Eleven countries/territories. OBJECTIVES: Global information on the determinants of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) based on representative data is not available. We therefore studied the relationship between demographic characteristics, prior TB treatment, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with anti-tuberculosis drug resistance. METHODS: Population-based representative data on new and previously treated patients with TB collected within an international drug resistance surveillance network. RESULTS: Of 9615 patients, 8222 (85.5%) were new cases of TB and 1393 (14.5%) were previously treated cases. Compared with new cases, previously treated cases were significantly more likely to have resistance to one (OR = 2.5, 95%CI 2.1-3.0; P < 0.001), two (OR = 4.6, 95% CI 3.7-5.6; P < 0.001), three (OR = 11.5, 95% CI 8.6-15.3; P < 0.001), and four (OR = 18.5, 95%CI 12.0-28.5; P < 0.001) drugs. An approximately linear increase in the likelihood of having multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) was observed as the total time (measured in months) of prior anti-tuberculosis treatment increased (P < 0.001, <chi>(2) for trend). In multivariate analysis, prior TB treatment for 6-11 months (OR = 7.6, 95%CI 2.6, 22.4; P < 0.001) and greater than or equal to 12 months (OR 13.7, 95%CI 4.5-41.6; P < 0.001), but not HIV positivity, was associated with MDR-TB. CONCLUSION: This study shows that prior but ineffective treatment is a strong predictor of drug resistance, and that HIV is not an independent risk factor for MDR-TB. The association between length of treatment and drug resistance may reflect longer treatment as a result of treatment failure in patients with drug resistance; it may also reflect irregular prior treatment for TB, leading to drug resistance.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; risk factors	HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; HIV-INFECTION; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS
pub-1993	Surveillance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance in Hong Kong, 1986-1999, after the implementation of directly observed treatment	OBJECTIVE: To study changing trends in TB epidemiology with emphasis on drug resistance rates in various age-groups from 1986-1999. DESIGN: Laboratory-based data on drug susceptibility testing against streptomycin (SM), isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP) and ethambutol (EMB) had been collected continuously in a centralised TB laboratory in Hong Kong. Epidemiological parameters such as sex, age and drug resistance rates in new and retreatment cases were measured and analysed for longitudinal trends. RESULTS: Of 48 924 non-duplicate isolates from new TB cases, 7045 (14.4%) were resistant to one or more drugs, 5773 (11.8%) were resistant to SM and/or INH while 881 (1.8%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB). Of 3857 isolates from retreatment patients, 1176 (30.5%) were resistant to one or more drugs, 616 (16.0%) were resistant to SM and/or INH, and 467 (12.1%) were MDR-TB.. For isolates from new cases, significant declines were observed in the resistance rates against any drug, SM alone, INH alone, SM+INH and INH+RMP. For retreatment isolates, significant declines were also observed in resistance to any drug and INH+RMP. In both new and retreatment cases, isolates from patients aged over 65 years showed significantly lower drug resistance (any drug and INH+RMP) compared with other age groups (16-34 years and 35-65 years). CONCLUSION: With successful implementation of DOTS over a 14-year period, laboratory-based surveillance data showed significant declines in drug resistance, including MDR-TB. This has occurred amidst demographic changes associated with a generally ageing population as well as highly mobile sectors that are in constant exchange with highly endemic areas.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; epidemiology; Hong Kong	
10.1016_S0140_6736_01_05621_5	Comparison of the effectiveness of WHO short-course chemotherapy and standard Russian antituberculous regimens in Tomsk, western Siberia	Background There has been a resurgence of tuberculosis in Russia in the past decade. Traditional Russian services for treatment of tuberculosis are very different from those in the west. We aimed to compare the effects of WHO short-course chemotherapy with standard Russian antituberculous regimens. Methods New tuberculosis patients aged 18 years or older were included in a trial and systematically allocated to traditional Russian tuberculosis treatments or WHO short-course chemotherapy in the two largest tuberculosis diagnostic and treatment centres of Tomsk Oblast, western Siberia. Standard WHO tuberculosis outcomes and rates of sputum conversion were used as primary outcomes. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. Findings 646 new cases were enrolled into the trial, of which 356 patients were given Russian tuberculosis treatment (155 smear positive) and 290 were given WHO short-course chemotherapy (155 smear positive). There was no statistical difference between the proportion cured or completing treatment (63% for both groups [difference in proportion=0%, 95% CI -11 to 11%]); or dying (short-course chemotherapy, 8% vs Russian, 11% [difference in proportion=-3%, 95% CI -9 to 4%]). There was no statistical difference with respect to sputum conversion rate at 6 months (91% vs 85% [difference in proportion=6%, 95% CI -2 to 13%]). Overall, outcomes were worse among patients with multidrug resistant isolates than non-resistant isolates. Interpretation WHO short-course chemotherapy treatment for tuberculosis can work well in Russia.		TREATMENT FAILURE; MDR-TB; TUBERCULOSIS

Methods: Retrospective chart review of all patients (n = 81) with diagnoses of MDR-TB in Florida between January 1, 1994, and July 31, 1997. Results: The average number of resistant drugs was 4.8 (range, 2 to 11). Of 81 patients, 46 patients (57%) completed adequate therapy, 26 patients (32%) died, and 9 patients (11%) never completed a satisfactory course of treatment. Patients who received at least part of their therapy at A. G. Holley State Hospital, a specialized tuberculosis (TB) treatment center, had significantly higher treatment completion rates (79%) than those treated as outpatients alone (48% treatment completion rate, p < 0.001), even after the exclusion of patients who were acutely ill and died, within 2 months of diagnosis. Conclusion: In Florida, a specialized TB care program for MDR-TB, including at least partial inpatient therapy, yielded higher treatment completion rates compared to outpatient treatment alone.

10.1056_NEJM200107193450303	The treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Turkey	Background: We evaluated the results of treatment in 158 consecutive patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis who were treated at our center in Istanbul, Turkey. Methods: A total of 21 female patients and 137 male patients (age range, 15 to 68 years) received treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis between March 1992 and October 1999. The patients had previously received a mean of 5.7 antituberculosis drugs and were infected with organisms that were resistant to a mean of 4.4 drugs. All patients received at least three drugs thought to be active; the treatment was continued for at least 18 months after the conversion to a negative culture and for at least 24 months in the absence of first-line drugs. Results: The mean number of drugs given during the study was 5.5 (range, 3 to 9). Surgical resection was performed in 36 patients. Adverse effects led to discontinuation of one or more drugs in 62 patients (39 percent). Cultures became negative in 150 patients (95 percent) after a mean of 1.9 months (range, 1 to 9). The overall success rate of treatment was 77 percent, with cures in 78 patients (49 percent) and probable cures in 43 (27 percent). Treatment failed in 13 patients (8 percent). Seven patients died (4 percent). Seventeen patients (11 percent) did not complete the treatment regimen. Thirty-eight percent of the patients with unsuccessful outcomes were infected with organisms that were resistant to more than five drugs. In a step-down logistic-regression analysis, a successful outcome was independently associated with a younger age (P=0.013) and the absence of previous treatment with ofloxacin (P=0.005). Conclusions: Most patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis can be cured with the use of appropriate, intensive treatment regimens. (N Engl J Med 2001;345:170-4.)

pub-1997	Occurrence of serious adverse effects in patients receiving community-based therapy for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: A community-based treatment program for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in an urban shantytown of Lima, Peru. OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the occurrence of serious adverse effects associated with therapy for MDR-TB in northern Lima, Peru, where therapy was individualized according to drug-susceptibility testing of patients' infecting strains and delivered through a community-based program. DESIGN: A retrospective record review of 60 patients who had received individualized therapy for MDR-TB between September 1996 and October 1998. RESULTS: Although adverse effects were common, they occurred less frequently than previously reported in the literature and were rarely life-threatening. Effects occurring most frequently in this population included: mild gastritis (100%), dermatological effects (43.3%), peripheral neuropathy (16.7%), depression (18.3%), and anxiety (11.7%). These effects never resulted in the discontinuation of anti-tuberculosis therapy, and only occasionally resulted in the suspension of an agent (11.7%). CONCLUSION: In young patients with little comorbid disease, multidrug, long-course regimens rarely caused life-threatening adverse effects. Common side effects may be managed successfully on an out-patient basis through a community-based treatment program in conjunction with MDR-TB experts, even in resource-poor settings. The very low rate of default in this cohort offers hope that strategies to manage the adverse effects may reduce the incidence of abandonment of therapy and increase rates of cure.	tuberculosis; antimicrobial resistance; adverse effects	SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS; OUTCOMES; MANAGEMENT; TOXICITY; AMINOGLYCOSIDES; REGIMENS
pub-1998	Increased resistance to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from patients seen at a tertiary hospital in the Philippines	SETTING: A hospital-based study at the Makati Medical Center, Makati City, Philippines, a hyperendemic area for tuberculosis (TB). OBJECTIVE: TO determine the susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of drug susceptibility tests (DST) of M. tuberculosis isolated from 1995-2000. RESULTS: Resistance to ciprofloxacin was 26.8%, ofloxacin 35.3%, and multidrug resistance (MDR) was 17.2%. Of the MDR strains, 51.4% were resistant to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Acquired resistance was significantly higher for all first-line drugs and for ciprofloxacin, but not for ofloxacin. A significant increase in resistance to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin was noted compared to 1989-1994, while resistance to the first-line drugs was not significantly different. CONCLUSION: Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin are now a significantly less effective alternative therapy in tuberculosis, particularly MDR-TB, due to a selection pressure from their widespread use in the treatment of TB and possibly other infections in the community, which is hyperendemic for tuberculosis.

pub-1999	Familial outbreak of disseminated multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and meningitis	Rapidly progressive multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is well documented in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive subjects, but it is not fully recognised in HN-negative subjects in the familial environment. We report three cases of MDR-TB in three young HIV-negative subjects from the same family. All the patients showed signs of meningitis during the course of their disease, and in two cases a resistant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated in cerebrospinal fluid. Two of the three subjects died from neurological complications; the other was successful treated utilising both systemic and intrathecal therapy for tuberculous meningitis. By a retrospective analysis of DNA obtained from Lowenstein-Jensen cultures, the strains were confirmed as M. tuberculosis resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid, and were closely related in the two cases where specimens were available for analysis. The resistance was acquired in two patients initially infected with a susceptible strain; in the other patient, the resistance was present on the first sensitivity test for which results were available. This report demonstrates the high risk of fatality from MDR-TB for HIV-negative subjects in the absence of reliable early diagnostic and preventive tools. It also reinforces the concept that genetic susceptibility to M. tuberculosis may be an important factor in the clinical presentation and outcome of MDR-TB.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; tuberculous meningitis; tuberculosis	HEALTH-CARE WORKERS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANT; TRANSMISSION; INFECTION; MUTATIONS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; CHILDHOOD; BACILLI; GENE
pub-2000	Efficacy and safety of sparfloxacin in combination with kanamycin and ethionamide in multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis patients: preliminary results	SETTING: Department of tuberculosis and chest diseases of a tertiary referral tuberculosis institute in New Delhi, India. OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy and safety of sparfloxacin, in combination with kanamycin (for the initial 3-4 months) and ethionamide, in multidrug-resistant (MDR) pulmonary tuberculosis patients. DESIGN: Prospective, uncontrolled study of nine patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who had received adequate anti-tuberculosis treatment with first-line drugs, including supervised category II treatment regimen as per World Health Organization guidelines for 5 months, and were still sputum smear acid-fast bacilli positive. It was planned to give them kanamycin (initial 3-4 months), ethionamide and sparfloxacin for 2 years. RESULTS: All nine patients achieved sputum conversion within G months. Seven patients converted within 3.5 months, two of these within 1 month. All patients reported improvement in clinical symptoms, and chest X-ray improved in seven patients. Four patients developed mild to moderate phototoxicity. Eight patients have completed treatment for an average of 19 months (range 15-24 months), and are still under follow-up. One patient defaulted after 7 months of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In MDR-TB patients, sparfloxacin, along with other anti-tuberculosis drugs, appears to be effective and safe. Mild to moderate phototoxicity is common. However, the long-term results, including relapses, are still awaited.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; quinolones; sparfloxacin	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; FLUOROQUINOLONES; AT-4140
pub-2001	A case series: initial outcome of persons with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis after treatment with the WHO standard retreatment regimen in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam	Few data address the outcomes of patients who have multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin, and who receive a standard World Health Organization (WHO) recommended retreatment regimen after relapse or failure with initial treatment. hi this case series, we examined treatment outcomes of a convenience sample of 42 relapse or failure patients who had documented MDR-TB and who had received a standard WHO retreatment regimen (2SHRZW/1HRZE/5H(3)R(3)E(3)). One patient died of tuberculosis in the last month of treatment; the remaining 41 patients completed retreatment. Of the 42, 14 (33%) were sputum smear-negative on completion of therapy. The proportion of patients cured of MDR-TB with the WHO retreatment regimen was similar to historic outcomes when no chemotherapy for TB was given.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; relapse and failure cases; retreatment regimen	MDR-TB; DOTS PLUS
10.1016_S0924_8579_01_00298_9	Increasing resistance of M-tuberculosis to anti-TB drugs in Saudi Arabia	The incidence of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolated from our hospital between April 1996 and March 1998 was compared with an earlier study (1993-1995). Thirty (29.7%) of 101 MTB isolates were resistant to one or more anti-TB drugs and 21 (20%) of 101 were multi-drug resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Resistance was most common to isoniazid (28.7%), followed by streptomycin (22.8%) and rifampicin (20.8%). Resistance to pyrazinamide and ethambutol was 7.9 and 6.9%, respectively. There was a three-fold increase in resistance compared with the earlier study. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy. All rights reserved.

pub-2003	Risk factors for nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium bovis among HIV-infected patients	OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) among hospitalized human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients exposed during a nosocomial outbreak. DESIGN: Case control study. Cases were HIV-infected patients with MDR-TB due to Mycobacterium bovis (MDR-TBMb) who acquired the disease after exposure to an MDR-TBMb patient in an hospital ward. Controls were HIV-infected patients exposed to a case of MDR-TBMb in an hospital ward but who did not develop MDR-TBMb during the follow-up. RESULTS: Nineteen cases and 31 controls were included. CD4 cell counts were significantly lower among cases. Exposure in the infectious diseases ward or exposure to the index patient were associated with development of MDR-TBMb, while exposure during a single-room hospital stay and exposure in the respiratory isolation ward were associated with non-development of MDR-TBMb. A multiple regression logistic model showed that only a CD4 cell count below 50/muL and exposure to the index patient increased the risk of developing MDR-TBMb (P < 0.05). Hospitalization in a single room seemed to protect HIV-infected patients from developing nosocomial MDR-TBMb (P = 0.052). CONCLUSIONS: Over classic risk factors, such as length of exposure or sharing a room with a case, severe immunosuppression independently increases the risk of MDR-TB transmission in the context of a nosocomial MDR-TB outbreak among HIV-infected patients. This information must be considered in the management of tuberculosis outbreaks. Patients with CD4 cell counts below 50/<mu>L should be the principal group targeted for prevention strategies in nosocomial outbreaks.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; nosocomial infections; case control study; risk factors; CD4 cell count; Mycobacterium bovis	HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; HEALTH-CARE WORKERS; OUTBREAK; EPIDEMIC; DRUGS
pub-2004	Infection and disease among household contacts of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: Urban public teaching and referral hospital in Espirito Santo, Brazil. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether rates of infection and progression to active tuberculosis (TB) differed between household contacts of patients with multi drug-resistant (MDR) and drug susceptible (DS) pulmonary tuberculosis. DESIGN: Household contacts were assessed for evidence of TB infection and disease by purified protein derivative (PPD) skin testing, physical examination, chest X-ray, and sputum smear and culture. RESULTS: Among 133 close contacts of patients with MDR-TB, 44% were PPD-positive (greater than or equal to 10 mm) compared to 37% of 231 contacts of the DS-TB cases (P = 0.18, chi (2) test, or 1.2, 95%CI 0.8-2). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, after allowance for between-household variation in PPD responses, PPD positivity among household contacts of patients with MDR-TB remained comparable to PPD positivity in contacts of patients with DS-TB (OR 2.1, 95%CI 0.7-6.5). Respectively six (4%) and 11 (4%) contacts of the MDR- and DS-TB cases were found to have active TB at the time of initial evaluation or during follow-up (P = 0.78, chi (2) test). Five of six contacts of MDR-TB cases and nine of nine contacts of DS-TB cases who developed TB, and for whom drug susceptibility test results were available, had the same bacterial susceptibility profiles as their index cases. DNA fingerprinting analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was identical between household contacts with active TB and the index MDR or DS-TB case for all 14 pairs compared. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the prevalence of tuberculous infection and progression to active TB among household contacts exposed to DS and MDR-TB cases is comparable, despite a longer duration of exposure of contacts to the index case in patients with MDR-TB.	tuberculosis; MDR-TB; PPD; transmission	CALMETTE-GUERIN VACCINATION; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; TRANSMISSION; REACTIVITY; CHILDREN; BACILLI; BIRTH
pub-2005	Pulmonary resection in the treatment of patients with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Taiwan	SETTING: Chronic Disease Control Bureau, Department of Health, Taiwan. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of pulmonary resection in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid and rifampin (MDR-TB). DESIGN: In a retrospective cohort study, 27 MDR-TB patients who underwent pulmonary resection between December 1990 and March 1999 were reviewed. Individually-tailored treatment regimens were selected at a once-weekly staff conference following review of the patient's case history and drug susceptibility results. Surgery was performed for selected patients, essentially those: 1) whose medical treatment had failed, or for whom treatment failure seemed highly likely, or for whom posttreatment relapse seemed likely, 2) with predominantly localised disease, 3) with adequate cardiopulmonary reserve, and 4) whose treatment regimen had been composed of at least two effective drugs to diminish the mycobacterial burden. RESULTS: There was no surgical mortality apart from one peri-operative death (4%). Three patients (11%) developed complications, and 24 (92%) patients demonstrated sputum conversion and/or remained negative after surgery. Twenty-three patients have already completed treatment, and during a mean of 42 +/- 18 followup months (range 15-80 months), one patient relapsed. This patient was disease-free after another course of treatment. CONCLUSION: For selected patients, pulmonary resection may improve the outcome of pulmonary MDR-TB.	surgery; pulmonary resection; multidrug-resistant; tuberculosis; Taiwan	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG RESISTANCE; CHEMOTHERAPY; RIFAMPIN
pub-2006	Low failure rate in standardised retreatment of tuberculosis in Nicaragua: patient category, drug resistance and survival of 'chronic' patients	SETTING: IUATLD collaborative programme, Nicaragua. OBJECTIVE: To analyse reported trends in the retreatment failure rate (2SRHZE/1RHZE/5R(3)H(3)E(3)), and assess demographic characteristics, drug resistance and survival in patients who fail retreatment. DESIGN: A retrospective, descriptive study. Reports from 1988-1996 were analysed and records of 69 patients who failed retreatment were reviewed. RESULTS: The treatment success rate in new cases improved from 71% in 1988-1991 to 79% in 1992-1996, the default rate decreased from 16% to 10%, and the failure rate remained stable at 2-3%. The proportion of previously treated patients among all smear-positives decreased from 20% to 15%. In retreatment patients the failure rate declined from 6.6% to 4.3% and the average annual number of failures from 24 to 13. Tn 1992-1996, 64 patients, 0.8% of new smear-positive cases treated during this period, failed retreatment; the corresponding figures for 1988-1991 are 95 and 1.6%. Among 69 retreatment failure cases reviewed, there was male predominance and increasing age during the study period. Drug susceptibility results were available for 38, of whom 89% were resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin. The median survival of patients after failure was 3.9 years. CONCLUSION: Treatment results improved over the study period. The proportion of patients on retreatment out of all smear positives treated decreased, as did the absolute number of failures and the retreatment failure rate. Development of multidrug resistance has been largely prevented in Nicaragua; the low failure rate justifies the continued use of the standardised retreatment regimen.	tuberculosis; failure; retreatment; drug resistance; survival	MDR-TB; PROGRAM
pub-2007	Tuberculosis as an occupational hazard for health care workers in Estonia	SETTING: Tuberculosis incidence has been increasing in the Baltic states since the 1990s, accompanied by the emergence of drug resistance, including multidrug resistance (MDR). In this changing situation, the potential threat of nosocomial spread of tuberculosis to other patients and health care workers (HCW) has remained unrecognised. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk of tuberculosis in health care workers in Estonia. DESIGN: Cases of tuberculosis registered among HCWs from 1994 to 1998 were evaluated. The case records were analysed retrospectively and combined with bacteriological data including data on drug resistance. RESULTS: Sixty-seven HCWs (23 physicians, 23 nurses and seven laboratory technicians, 12 assistant nurses and two cleaners), all of whom tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus, were diagnosed as having active tuberculosis. The incidence of tuberculosis among HCWs (mean 91/100000/year) was 1.5 to three times higher than in the general population In a chest hospital in charge of regional tuberculosis care, the incidence was 30 to 90 times higher, and was highest among physicians. In 49 HCWs tuberculosis was confirmed by culture. Among these, drug resistance was detected in 23 (49%), 18 (38%) of whom had MDR tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: Health care workers, especially those working in a chest hospital where tuberculosis patients were treated, were found to be at an elevated risk of tuberculosis. MDR tuberculosis poses a particular threat which is difficult to combat.	tuberculosis; exposure; nosocomial transmission; drug resistance; MDR-TB	RESISTANT MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; NOSOCOMIAL TRANSMISSION; HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES; PHYSICIANS; RISK; INFECTION; OUTBREAK
10.1128_JCM.39.2.636_641.2001	Analysis for a limited number of gene codons can predict drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a high-incidence community	"Correct and rapid diagnosis is essential in the management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). In this population-based study of 61 patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis, we evaluated the frequency of mutations and compared the performance of genotypic (mutation analysis by dot blot hybridization) and phenotypic (indirect proportion method) drug resistance tests. Three selected codons (rpoB531, rpoB526, and katG315) allowed identification of 90% of MDR-TB cases. Ninety percent of rifampin, streptomycin, and ethambutol resistance and 75% of isoniazid resistance were detected by screening for six codons: rpoB531, rpoB526, rrs-513, rpsL43, embB306, and katG315. The performance (reproducibility, sensitivity, and specificity) of the genotypic method was superior to that of the routine phenotypic method, with the exception of sensitivity for isoniazid resistance. A commercialized molecular genetic test for a limited number of target loci might be a good alternative for a drug resistance screening test in the context of an MDR ""DOTS-plus"" strategy."

10.1098_rspb.2000.1328	Will tuberculosis become resistant to all antibiotics?	The discovery of high prevalences of antibiotic resistance in some pathogens, in some parts of the world, has provoked fears of a widespread loss of drug efficacy. Here, we use a mathematical model to investigate the evolution of resistance to four major anti-tuberculosis drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin) in 47 sites around the world. The model provides a new method of estimating the relative risk of treatment failure for patients carrying drug-resistant strains and the proportion of patients who develop resistance after failing treatment. Using estimates of these two quantities together with other published data, we reconstructed the epidemic spread of isoniazid resistance over the past 50 years. The predicted median prevalence of resistance among new cases today was 7.0% (range 0.9-64.3%), close to the 6.3% (range 0-28.1%) observed. Predicted and observed prevalences of resistance to isoniazid plus rifampicin (multidrug-resistant or MDR-TB) after 30 years of combined drug use were also similar, 0.9% (0.1-5.9%) and 1.0% (range 0-14.1%), respectively. With current data, and under prevailing treatment: practices, it appears that MDR-TB will remain a localized problem, rather than becoming a global obstacle to tuberculosis control. To substantiate this result, further measurements are needed of the relative fitness of drug-resistant strains.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; MDR-TB; isoniazid; rifampicin; mathematical modelling	
10.3201_eid0701.010117	Hospital control and multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis in female patients, Lima, Peru	We examined the prevalence of tuberculosis (TB), rate of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB, and characteristics of TB on a female general medicine ward in Peru. Of 250 patients, 40 (16%) were positive by sputum culture and 27 (11%) by smear, and 8 (3%) had MDRTB. Thirteen (33%) of 40 culture-positive patients had not been suspected of having TB on admission. Six (46%) of 13 patients whose TB was unsuspected on admission had MDRTB, compared with 2 (7%) of 27 suspected cases (p=0.009). Five (63%) of 8 MDRTB patients were smear positive and therefore highly infective. In developing countries, hospital control, a simple method of reducing the spread of MDRTB, is neglected.

pub-2011	Prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis in an HIV endemic area in northern Thailand	SETTING: Chiang Rai Province in Northern Thailand, where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been prevalent since the 1990s. OBJECTIVE: To observe the prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and investigate the factors related to the level of drug resistance in an HN endemic area. DESIGN: Population-based surveillance study covering the whole province. METHOD: Drug susceptibility testing was performed at the Thai Ministry of Public Health laboratory for all sputum smear-positive TB patients diagnosed in hospitals in Chiang Rai Province over a 25-month period in 1996-1998. Patient characteristics were obtained through interview by trained personnel. HIV testing was performed with informed consent. RESULTS: Among the 1077 incident patients without previous history of treatment, the proportion of patients with resistance to isoniazid was 13.2%, 10.8% to rifampicin, 15.6% to streptomycin, and 5.8% to ethambutol. Multidrug resistance (MDR), i.e., resistance to at least both isoniazid and rifampicin, was observed in 6.3%. Factors associated with primary MDR-TB were HIV positivity (OR 2.2, 95%CI 1.3-3.9), age < 50 years (OR 2.0), and treatment in the provincial hospital (OR 2.3), compared to patients treated in the community and private hospitals. Stratified analysis shows a significantly high prevalence of primary MDR-TB among HIV-positive patients treated in the provincial hospital against HIV-negative patients or HIV-positive patients in other hospitals. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of primary MDR-TB in this area was high. It is necessary to strengthen TB control activities in order to reduce the burden of MDR-TB.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; survey; HIV; Thailand	IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS INFECTION; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; GLOBAL SURVEILLANCE; SAN-FRANCISCO; EPIDEMIOLOGY; TRANSMISSION; BOVIS
pub-2012	Drug-resistant tuberculosis in foreign-born persons from Mexico, the Philippines, and Vietnam - United States, 1993-1997	SETTING: Foreign-born persons in the United States represent a growing proportion of the nation's tuberculosis(TB)cases. OBJECTIVE: To characterize drug resistance patterns in foreign-born TB patients from the three most common birth countries. DESIGN: A descriptive analysis of national TB surveillance data for 1993-1997. TB case reports for foreign-born persons who were at least 15 years old and born either in Mexico (6221), the Philippines (3624), or Vietnam (3351) were included. RESULTS: Among those with no prior history of TB, the proportions with isoniazid-resistant TB and MDR-TB (resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin) were 9.2% and 1.6% for persons from Mexico, 13.7% and 1.4% for those from the Philippines, and 17.8% and 1.4% for those from Vietnam. Levels of isoniazid resistance and MDR-TB did not change during the 5-year study period. Levels of isoniazid resistance decreased with older age for persons with no prior TB from all three countries; however, rates of MDR-TB did not vary with age. Persons with <1 year of residence in the US were more likely to have MDR-TB; however, duration of residence in the US was not associated with isoniazid resistance. CONCLUSION: Increased drug resistance in younger and more recent arrivals suggests that vigorous efforts to prevent further development of MDR-TB in the three countries are essential.	drug resistance; immigration; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SAN-FRANCISCO; EPIDEMIOLOGY; TRANSMISSION; INFECTION
pub-2013	Outbreak of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis at a methadone treatment program	SETTING: An out-patient methadone treatment program (MTP). OBJECTIVE: To investigate transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the MTP. DESIGN: Cases were defined as MTP clients or staff who developed TB between I January 1994 and 1 January 1996, with at least one positive culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid and rifampin. Contacts were identified, located and evaluated. RESULTS: Thirteen cases of MDR-TB occurred among 462 clients and staff. One fifth (6/30) of the members of a counseling group for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected clients developed MDR-TB. Individuals known to be HIV positive were at greater risk for TB than those who were HIV negative (RR 5.2, 95%CI 1.2-22.7). Of 449 clients and staff identified as contacts, 393 (87.5%) were located and screened. Among those with a negative baseline tuberculin skin test, 18.5% (56/303) were skin test converters. Attendance at the MTP during a period when the index case was infectious was associated with an increased risk of conversion (RR 2.5, 95%CI 1.1-6.0). CONCLUSION: Extensive transmission of MDR-TB occurred at an out-patient MTP serving numerous clients with HIV infection. This outbreak underscores the importance of developing effective strategies to prevent TB transmission in this setting.	tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; methadone; outbreak	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; HIV-INFECTION; SHELTER; TRANSMISSION; HOMELESS
10.1053_jinf.2000.0773	Can a nine-month regimen be used to treat isoniazid resistant tuberculosis diagnosed after standard treatment is started?	Objectives: National tuberculosis treatment guidelines suggest a regimen of 2RZE/10RE for the treatment of isoniazid resistant organisms. A retrospective clinical study of all patients treated for non-MDR-TB isoniazid-resistant organisms was undertaken. Methods: A continuous database of the patients treated between 1978-1999 inclusive was examined to determine the regimens used and the outcome of treatment for such patients. Results: Thirty-seven patients were identified. Eighteen had regimens of greater than 9 months, 19 had regimens of 9 months or less. No relapses occurred in those cases treated with a regimen of 2RZE/7RE during 12 months' minimum follow-up. Conclusions: A regimen of 2RZE/7RE may be possible for the treatment, of isoniazid-resistant organisms if given either under close supervision or as a formally supervised regimen. Larger clinical studies or a controlled clinical trial are needed to confirm these initial findings. (C) 2001 The British Infection Society.		PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS
10.1136_thorax.55.11.962	Resource implications of patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis	Background-Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) requires a complex drug regimen and lengthy multidisciplinary care. The financial cost of successful management of each case is potentially large. Methods-The costs of managing nine HIV negative patients with pulmonary MDR TB were compared with 18 age group and ethnicity matched controls with fully sensitive disease. Calculations included: cost of outpatient visits and inpatient stays including negative pressure isolation; costs of drug provision and toxicity monitoring; costs of additional procedures and multidisciplinary referrals. Results-The mean cost of managing a case of pulmonary MDR TB was in excess of pound 60 000 and for sensitive disease it was pound 6040. Conclusions-Clinicians and healthcare commissioning authorities may both be underestimating the costs of managing MDR TB, and accordingly the consequences for units dealing with such cases may be serious. Funding of care for MDR TB in the UK requires strategic decisions at regional or governmental level.	tuberculosis; multidrug resistance; healthcare resources	
pub-2016	Surveillance of drug-resistant tuberculosis and molecular evaluation of transmission of resistant strains in refugee and non-refugee populations in North-Eastern Kenya	SETTING: Three refugee camp complex clinics and an adjacent non-refugee treatment centre in North-Eastern Ken ya. OBJECTIVES: To use conventional and molecular epidemiology tools to determine: 1) the prevalence of drug resistance in newly diagnosed patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis in refugee and non-refugee populations; 2) risk factors for resistance in the two populations; and 3) whether ISG6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and spoligotyping showed similarities in DNA fingerprinting patterns of drug-resistant isolates that could infer transmission within and between the two populations. RESULTS: Of 241 isolates from the camps, 44 (18.3%) were resistant to one or more drugs, seven of which (2.9%) were multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Of 88 isolates from the non-refugees, five (5.7%) were resistant to one or more drugs without MDR-TB. Drug resistance was higher in the camps than in the non-refugee population (OR = 3.7; 95%CI 1.42-3.68; P < 0.007). Resistance was significantly higher in one camp compared with the other two, despite a comparable ethnic distribution. Unusually, females were more associated with drug resistance than their male counterparts in both populations (OR = 2.3; 95%CI 1.2-4.8; P = 0.008). There was evidence of transmission of streptomycin-resistant strains in the refugee population. DNA fingerprints of resistant strains from the non-refugee population were unique and different from those in the refugee camps. CONCLUSION: The observed high levels of drug resistance and MDR-TB, combined with evidence of transmission of strains resistant to streptomycin in the refugee population, suggest a need for strengthened TB control programmes in settings with a high risk of developing drug-resistant strains.	drug-resistant tuberculosis; transmission; refugee camps; non-refugee; North-Eastern Kenya	FRAGMENT-LENGTH-POLYMORPHISM; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; IMMIGRANTS; DIFFERENTIATION; REINFECTION; OUTBREAK; SOMALIA; AREA
pub-2017	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: long-term treatment outcome in the Netherlands	SETTING: Tuberculosis units (Beatrixoord, Haren; and Dekkerswald, Groesbeek) in the Netherlands. OBJECTIVE: TO study the long-term treatment outcome of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of all consecutively admitted patients with MDR-TB between 1 January 1985 and I September 1998, with follow-up until 1 August 1999. RESULTS: Of 44 patients (31 male) enrolled in the study, 33 were foreign born and none were human immunodeficiency virus positive. At diagnosis 38 patients had sputum-smear positive pulmonary TB, and convened culture negative after a mean of 6 weeks, while six convened to negative later (mean 69 weeks). Most patients had micro-organisms resistant to several antimycobacterial drugs (mean = median: 5), including resistance to isoniazid and rifampin. In-patient treatment lasted a mean of 164 days (range 31-481), and patients were treated with six drugs on average. Side effects were common. Treatment lasted for a mean of 608 days (range 268-1626); five patients are still on treatment. Four patients were operated for TB, and two others were operated for post-TB sequelae. During the follow-up Period six patients died, of whom three had active TB; 33 (75%) were considered cured. CONCLUSION: Mortality was only 14% after a mean follow-up period of 53 months. MDR-TB can be successfully treated, but requires much effort from both patients and carers, and the costs may be higher than is affordable in resource-poor countries.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; tertiary; care centre; outcome; survival	DIRECTLY OBSERVED THERAPY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANT; ISONIAZID RESISTANCE; DOTS STRATEGY; SOUTH-AFRICA; MUTATIONS; RIFAMPIN; COMMUNITY; SURVEILLANCE
10.1073_pnas.140102797	Criteria for the control of drug-resistant tuberculosis	Antibiotic resistance is a growing impediment to the control of infectious diseases worldwide, tuberculosis (TB) being among them. TB kills two million people each year and foci of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) have been identified in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. A critical question for health policy is whether standardized short-course chemotherapy for TB, based on cheap first-line drugs, can prevent and reverse the spread of drug resistance. Here we use mathematical modeling, in conjunction with treatment results from six countries, to show that best-practice short-course chemotherapy is highly likely to bring strains resistant to either of the two key drugs isoniazid and rifampicin under control and to prevent the emergence of MDR-TB, However, it is not certain to contain MDR-TB once it has emerged, partly because cure rates are too low. We estimate that approximately 70% of prevalent, infectious MDR-TB cases should be detected and treated each year, and at least 80% of these cases should be cured, in order to prevent outbreaks of MDR-TB. Poor control programs should aim to increase case detection and cure rates together for three reasons: (i) these variables act synergistically; (ii) when either is low, the other cannot succeed alone; and (iii) the second-line drugs needed to raise MDR-TB cure rates are few and extremely costly. We discuss the implications of these results for World Health Organization policy on the management of antibiotic resistance.		ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE; DISEASE
pub-2019	Surveillance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance France, 1995-1997	OBJECTIVE: To measure the rate of primary and secondary drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis on an ongoing basis. DESIGN: Data on all culture-positive tuberculosis were collected prospectively from 1995 through 1997 from a microbiological laboratory network of 19 university hospitals throughout France, and submitted quarterly to the National Reference Centre for Surveillance of Mycobacterial Diseases. RESULTS: A total of 2998 patients were included in the study. Among the 2333 (78%) previously untreated patients, 8.6% had isolates resistant to any drug, 4.8% to streptomycin (SM) alone, 1.2% to isoniazid (INH) alone, 1.8% to SM + INH, and 0.3% to INH + rifampicin (RMP) or multidrug resistance (MDR). Foreign birth was independently associated with a higher risk of primary resistance to any drug (odds ratio [OR] 1.5). Among the 268 (9%) previously treated patients, 20.9% had isolates resistant to any drug, 6.3% to SM alone, 3.4% to INH alone, 4.1% to SM + INH, and 3.7% to INH + RMP. Foreign birth (OR = 2.3), and human immunodeficiency virus positive status (OR = 4.4) were independently associated with a higher risk of secondary resistance to any drug. CONCLUSION: During the last 30 years there has been no increase in resistance to any drug among previously untreated patients. As expected, secondary resistance was highly associated with foreign birth. MDR-TB remains a rare event in France.

pub-2020	Clinical and programmatic mismanagement rather than community outbreak as the cause of chronic, drug-resistant tuberculosis in Buenaventura, Colombia, 1998	SETTING: Buenaventura, Colombia. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether antituberculosis drug resistance was generated by poor management or community transmission. DESIGN: Treatment-failure and new tuberculosis (TB) patients identified between May 1997 and June 1998 were interviewed and their treatment histories reviewed. Bacteriologic testing, including drug susceptibility profiles (DSP) and DNA fingerprinting by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), was performed and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was offered. RESULTS: DSP and RFLP fingerprints were obtained for isolates from 34 of 64 treatment-failure patients; 25 (74%) were resistant to greater than or equal to one drug. Fifteen of the 25 patients consented to HIV testing; none were positive. An average of 2.8 major treatment errors per patient was identified. RFLP from the treatment-failure patients revealed 20 unique isolates and six clusters (isolates with identical RFLP); 4/6 clusters contained isolates with different DSP. Analysis of the RFLP from both treatment-failure and new patients revealed that 44/111 (40%) isolates formed 18 clusters. Four of 47 (9%) new patients had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Eleven isolates belonged to the Beijing family, related to the MDR strain W. CONCLUSION: Drug resistance in Buenaventura results from both poor management and community transmission. Dependence on DSP to identify TB transmission is inadequate when programmatic mismanagement is common.	tuberculosis; DNA fingerprinting; RFLP; multidrug resistance; Colombia; Beijing family	LENGTH-POLYMORPHISM ANALYSIS; HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; NEW-YORK-CITY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; POPULATION; PHYSICIAN
10.1099_0022_1317_49_7_651	Simultaneous identification and typing of multi-drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates by analysis of pncA and rpoB	In Mycobacterium tuberculosis there is a strong correlation between in-vitro resistance to rifampicin (RIF) and pyrazinamide (PZA) and mutations in rpoB and pncA, respectively. Approximately 50 mutations associated with resistance have been reported for rpoB and 70 for pncA, and, theoretically, many more are possible. Therefore, the identification of rpoB and pncA mutations in M. tuberculosis might be used for the simultaneous determination of resistance and for typing multi-drug-resistant (MRD) strains during possible outbreaks. The present study examined four sensitive and six MDR isolates of M. tuberculosis from Turkey and eight isolates from a nosocomial MDR tuberculosis (TB) outbreak in the UK, Gene mutations were identified by the Innogenetics LiPA rpoB assay or automated sequencing, or both. All the sensitive isolates had rpoB and pncA wild-type genotypes, whereas all the RIF- and PZA-resistant isolates had rpoB and pncA mutations. All four mutations seen in rpoB, but none of the sis in pncA, had been reported previously The rpoB and pncA mutations seen in the Turkish isolates defined six distinct genotypes amongst the sir MDR isolates, while standard IS6110 typing discriminated only four. All isolates from the single strain MDR-TB outbreak had identical genotypes. Rapid genotyping was performed on the sputum from a patient who presented 2 years after the initial MDR-TB outbreak and this shelved rpoB and pncA genotypes identical to the other outbreak isolates. This result was available within 36 h, The analysis of rpoB and pncA is a rapid and practical means of simultaneously identifying and typing MDR isolates of M. tuberculosis.

pub-2022	Human immunodeficiency virus-related tuberculosis and primary drug resistance in Bangkok, Thailand	SETTING: Central Chest Hospital, a 500-bed referral hospital near Bangkok with a large out-patient department. OBJECTIVES: TO determine human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroprevalence among patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), and compare HIV-positive and HN-negative TB patients. DESIGN: From July 1995 through June 1996, a cross-sectional study was conducted of newly registered adults (greater than or equal to 16 years old) with suspected pulmonary TB. RESULTS: Of 2587 newly registered patients with suspected pulmonary TB, 2019 (78%) received HN pretest counseling and 1816 (90%) consented to testing. Of these, 364 (20%) were HIV-seropositive. Among 1091 patients with bacteriologically confirmed TB, HIV seroprevalence was 22%. HIV-positive patients were more likely to be young, unemployed, single men and to have a history of injection drug use. HN-positive patients with first-episode TB were more likely to have Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to isoniazid (10.9% vs 3.5%; P< 0.001), rifampicin (9.4% vs 2.9%; P < 0.001), and at least isoniazid and rifampicin (multidrug-resistant TB [MDR-TB]; 5.2% vs 0.4%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: HIV prevalence is high among TB patients at this Bangkok hospital and is associated with drug resistance, including a 12 times higher risk of MDR-TB. These findings underscore the urgent need to assure adherence to complete, effective TB treatment regimens for all patients, including persons who are potentially difficult to manage such as injection drug users.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; HIV; Thailand; Asia	HIV-INFECTED PERSONS; NEW-YORK-CITY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; COTE-DIVOIRE; CHIANG-RAI; HIV-1-INFECTED PATIENTS; ABIDJAN; MORTALITY; EMERGENCE; THERAPY
pub-2023	Redefining MDR-TB transmission 'hot spots'	Halting further spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) requires both new resources and a renewed discussion of priority setting informed by estimates of the existing burden of this disease. The 1997 report of the first phase of the global survey by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) uses the indicator of the proportion of TB cases that are MDR-TB to identify MDR-TB 'hot spots'. We sought to refine the definition of MDR-TB transmission 'hot spots'. For this purpose, we obtained estimates of two additional indicators for regions where data are available: MDR-TB incidence per 100 000 population per year, and expected numbers of new patients with MDR-TB per year. There is generally much agreement in the three indicators considered, and some differences also appear. We conclude that it is useful, when defining indicators of MDR-TB transmission 'hot spots', to include estimates of underlying TB incidence rates and of absolute numbers of MDR-TB cases. Estimating the force of morbidity of MDR-TB in a population is important for comparing this burden across settings with very different underlying TB incidence rates; estimating the absolute number of MDR-TB patients will be critical for planning the delivery of directly observed MDR-TB therapy and the rational procurement of second-line drugs. Through this exercise, we aim to initiate discussion about improved methods of quantifying and comparing current MDR-TB transmission 'hot spots' that require intervention.	transmission; 'hot spots'; tuberculosis; MDR-TB; priority setting; DOTS Plus	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; NEW-YORK-CITY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; DOTS-PLUS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; PREVALENCE; REGIMEN; HIV
pub-2024	Detection of rifampicin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from diverse countries by a commercial line probe assay as an initial indicator of multidrug resistance	The line probe assay (LiPA), a rapid molecular method for detecting rifampicin resistance (RMPr) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, correctly identified all 145 rifampicin-sensitive (RMPs) and 262 (98.5%) of 266 RMPr strains among 411 isolates collected from diverse countries. If used as a marker of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), detection of RMPr by LiPA would have detected 236 of the 240 MDR strains in this study but would have wrongly suggested the presence of MDR in 26 RMP-monoresistant isolates (sensitivity 98.3%, specificity 84.8%). Hence, the reliability of using LiPA (or any other rapid RMPr-detection method) as a surrogate marker of MDR-TB largely depends on the prevalence of RMP-monoresistance in the study population. This approach must therefore be validated in each local situation.	tuberculosis; rifampicin; multidrug resistance	RAPID DETECTION; RPOB MUTATIONS; GENE; PCR
pub-2025	Aerosolized interferon-alpha treatment in patients with multi-drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis	Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has emerged as an obstacle to the control of tuberculosis. Recent data however, suggest that interferon-(IFN)-gamma and IFN-alpha may improve disease evolution in subjects affected with pulmonary tuberculosis caused by multi-resistant (IFN-gamma) and sensitive (IFN-alpha) strains. The mechanisms involved are not known, even though it has been reported that IFN-gamma-secreting CD4(+) Th cells may possess antitubercular effects. In addition, IFN-alpha can induce IFN-gamma secretion by CD4(+) Th cells, and both types of IFN may stimulate macrophage activities. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility that aerosolized IFN-alpha, administered concomitantly with conventional antitubercular chemotherapy, may improve the course of pulmonary tuberculosis. After six months of directly observed therapy (DOT), seven patients who were non-responders to a second line antitubercular therapy were given an IFN-alpha aerosol (3 MU, three times a week) for two months as adjunctive therapy. All strains were resistant to at least two first-line drugs, After IFN-alpha administration, the patients were followed up for a further six months with the same DOT. Sputum samples were collected monthly during the study period, with the exception of the IFN-alpha administration period, when the observations were performed weekly. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest scans were performed before and after IFN-alpha inhalations. The analysis of the results showed that the mean number of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt) had remained statistically unchanged (p = 0.80) during the first 6 months of DOT. During the following 2 months of IFN-alpha administration, 5 patients became negative (p = 0.02). After the end of treatment a progressive increase in Mt number was observed (p = 0.02), Sputum cultures remained positive for all patients throughout the study period, although a significant decrease (p = 0.02) in the colony number per culture was observed after adjunctive treatment with IFN-alpha. After stopping administration of IFN-alpha, a significant increase (p = 0.03) in the colony number per culture was noted as well as in Mt numbers. HRCT scans were slightly improved in all patients. These preliminary data suggest that aerosolized IFN-alpha may be a promising adjunctive therapy for patients with MDR-TB. Optimal doses and schedules however, require further studies.

pub-2026	Anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in Portugal	SETTING: A survey based upon a representative sample of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients was undertaken in Portugal, as part of the World Health Organization's Global Project on Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance. OBJECTIVE: TO determine the level of primary antituberculosis drug resistance at both national and regional levels, and to assess its relative weight within the performance of the National Tuberculosis Programme (NTP). DESIGN: Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from 1105 patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis admitted to 46 randomly stratified treatment centres all over mainland Portugal were submitted to susceptibility testing with four drugs. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was included in the patients' evaluation scheme. RESULTS: Of the strains isolated, 197 (17.8%) were resistant to at least one drug. Primary resistance to isoniazid was 7.7% and to rifampicin 1.9%. Acquired drug resistance was 39.2% in total, any acquired resistance to isoniazid 31.1% and to rifampicin 20.9%. Primary multidrug resistance (MDR) was 1.8% and acquired MDR was 20.9%. HIV testing was positive in 29.2% of MDR-TB cases. CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistance in Portugal is high. Primary MDR and particularly acquired MDR occur in a high proportion of cases, indicating a need for improvement in NTP performance.	tuberculosis; multidrug resistance; Portugal	HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; NEW-YORK-CITY; OUTBREAK; EPIDEMIOLOGY
pub-2027	Using treatment failure under effective directly observed short-course chemotherapy programs to identify patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	SETTING: Public ambulatory care centers in three districts of northern metropolitan Lima, Peru. OBJECTIVE: TO document drug resistance patterns of isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from patients identified as treatment failures under a model tuberculosis (TB) control program based on directly observed, short-course chemotherapy (DOT-SCC). DESIGN: Case series. RESULTS: In a referred, consecutive sample of 173 patients identified as treatment failures on DOT-SCC, 160 (92.5%) had culture-positive TB. Of those 160, 150 (93.8%) had active, pulmonary multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB, resistance to at least isoniazid [INH] and rifampicin [RIF]). Sixty of the 150 (40.0%) had isolates resistant to at least INH, RIF,ethambutol (EMB) and pyrazinamide (PZA), the initial first-line empiric treatment regimen used locally: Forty-four (29.3%) had isolates resistant to at least INH, RIF, EMB, PZA and streptomycin (SM), the first retreatment regimen. This series of patients had isolates resistant to a mean of 4.5 of the ten drugs tested. The local profile of multidrug resistance is very different from that obtained from national data from Peru. CONCLUSION: In this setting, treatment failure on DOT-SCC is strongly predictive of active MDR-TB. Because of existing local drug resistance patterns in northern Lima, 89.3% of MDR-TB patients identified as treatment failures will receive ineffective therapy with two or fewer secondary TB drugs if they are given the five-drug empiric retreatment regimen endorsed by the World Health Organization. Further short-course chemotherapy for these patients would only serve to amplify ominous existing drug resistance patterns.	treatment failure; directly observed therapy; tuberculosis; multidrug resistance; Peru; DOTS-Plus	DRUG-RESISTANCE; INFECTION
pub-2028	Directly observed treatment, short-course strategy and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: are any modifications required?	"Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) should be defined as tuberculosis with resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin because these drugs are the cornerstone of short-course chemotherapy, and combined isoniazrd and rifampicin resistance requires prolonged treatment with second-line agents. Short-course chemotherapy is a key ingredient in the tuberculosis control strategy known as directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS). Far populations in which multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is endemic, the outcome of the standard short-course chemotherapy regimen remains uncertain. Unacceptable failure rates have been reported and resistance to additional agents may be induced. As a consequence there have been calls for well-functioning DOTS programmes to provide additional services in areas with high rates of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. These ""DOTS-plus for MDRTB programmes"" may need to modify all five elements of the DOTS strategy: the treatment may need to be individualized rather than standardized; laboratory services may need to provide facilities for on-site culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing; reliable supplies of a wide range of expensive second-line agents would have to be supplied; operational studies would be required to determine the indications for and format of the expanded programmes; financial and technical support from international organizations and Western governments would be needed in addition to that obtained from local governments."	antitubercular agents, administration and dosage; and supply and distribution; drug therapy, combination; treatment failure; tuberculosis, multidrug-resistant, drug therapy and epidemiology	SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; ANTITUBERCULOSIS-DRUG-RESISTANCE; NEW-YORK-CITY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; GLOBAL SURVEILLANCE; UNITED-STATES; DOTS-PLUS; MDR-TB; RIFAMPIN
pub-2029	Transmission of tuberculosis in an endemic urban setting in Brazil	SETTING: Two out-patient facilities in Sao Paulo, Brazil. OBJECTIVE: To study the transmission pattern of tuberculosis (TB) among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected and uninfected persons in a setting endemic for TB. DESIGN: A prospective study comparing HIV-seropositive and -seronegative TB patients identified consecutively between 1 March 1995 and 1 April 1997, The patients were stratified according to their Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate IS6110 RFLP patterns. Risk factors were sought for infection with an RFLP cluster pattern strain, inferred to represent recent transmission. RESULTS: Fifty-eight (38%) of 151 HIV-seropositive patients and 36 (25%) of 142 HIV-seronegative patients were infected with M. tuberculosis isolates that belonged to cluster patterns (OR 1.84, 95%CI 1.08-3.13). Multi-drug-resistant (MDR) strains were isolated from 19 patients, all of whom were HIV seropositive; 12 (63%) of these, and 46 (35%) of 132 drug-susceptible isolates had cluster patterns (OR 3.20, 95%CI 1.08-9.77). CONCLUSION: In a TB-endemic urban setting in Brazil, the proportion of casts resulting from recent transmission appears to be greater among HIV-seropositive than among HIV-seronegative patients. A large proportion of MDR-TB (63%) cases was caused by strains that had cluster RFLP patterns, suggesting recent transmission of already resistant organisms. This type of knowledge regarding TB transmission may help to improve locally appropriate TR control programs.	tuberculosis; transmission; RFLP; Brazil; multidrug-resistant TB	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; NEW-YORK-CITY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DNA; EPIDEMIOLOGY; POPULATION; POLYMORPHISM; INFECTION; OUTBREAK; STRAINS
pub-2030	Effectiveness of infection control measures in controlling a nosocomial outbreak of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among HIV patients in Italy	SETTING: Between October 1992 and February 1994, 33 cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were diagnosed among patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hospitalised in an HIV ward in Milan, Italy. This outbreak was part of a much larger outbreak, begun in another hospital and probably transferred through a patient. OBJECTIVE: TO evaluate risk factors for transmission and the effectiveness of infection control measures. DESIGN: 1) Active follow-up of exposed patients, 2) cohort study among HIV-infected patients exposed to MDR-TB cases before and after the implementation of control measures, 3) screening of close contacts of MDR-TB cases, and 1) molecular typing by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. RESULTS: The risk of MDR-TB was higher in patients with lower CD4+ lymphocyte percentages and longer duration of exposure. No difference in the daily risk was observed for in-patients vs day-hospital patients or by room distance from an infectious case. Of the 90 patients exposed before the implementation of infection control measures (i,e,, October 1992-June 1993) 26 (28.9%) developed MDR-TB, whereas none of the 44 patients exclusively exposed after implementation developed MDR-TB, despite the continuing presence of infectious MDR-TB cases in the ward. CONCLUSION: Simple control measures were effective in significantly reducing nosocomial transmission among patients.	tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; multidrug resistance; outbreak; HIV infection; infection control measures; effectiveness	NEW-YORK-CITY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; TRANSMISSION

pub-2032	Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance in Turkey, 1976-97	Drug-resistant tuberculosis is increasing day by day and is a significant threat to tuberculosis control because there are few drugs effective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This study evaluates the resistance of the microorganism to primary anti-tuberculosis drugs over the 21-y period 1976-97. Records from the bacteriology laboratory of the Department of Chest Diseases and Tuberculosis, Ankara University Medical Faculty were evaluated retrospectively. Among 3,418 mycobacteria strains, 3,319 (97.1%) M, tuberculosis were isolated and their susceptibility was examined by the proportion method in Loewenstein-Jensen medium. It was found that 60.8% of isolated strains were susceptible, whereas 39.2% were resistant to at least one drug. Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) was found in 194 (5.8%) materials. Over the 21-y period studied, total resistance to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RF) and streptomycin (SNI) were determined as 10.5, 6.9 and 7.0%, respectively. It was also observed that the resistance rates to INH or SM increased, whereas resistance to RF was not changed within this period. While resistance to the 2-drug combination RF+SM increased, resistance to INH+SM decreased significantly. There was no change in resistance to the 2-drug INH+RF or 3-drug INH+RF+SM combinations in the same period. In conclusion, combined therapy is still useful and available for the treatment of resistant tuberculosis, and INH should be included in the chemotherapeutic regimen even if high resistance rates are shown to exist.		
10.1345_aph.19008	Multidrug-resistant tuberculous meningitis: Clinical problems and concentrations of second-line antituberculous medications	OBJECTIVE: TO describe a case of culture-proven multidrug-resistant tuberculous (MDR-TB) meningitis, in which the patient survived long enough for clinicians to adjust antituberculous therapy to second-line therapeutic agents. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PATIENT: Twenty-one-month-old girl with MDR-TB meningitis. INTERVENTIONS: Initial standard treatment failed. Subsequent treatment with second-line therapeutic agents including ciprofloxacin, cycloserine, ethambutol, ethionamide, and rifabutin were given for approximately two years. Concentrations of these drugs were measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid in the presence and absence of meningeal inflammation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES/RESULTS: The patient survived for approximately two years after initiation of second-line anti-TB therapy. During this treatment, she developed a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt tunnel tract infection secondary to MDR-TB. CONCLUSIONS: All TB meningitis isolates for which the source case antibiotic susceptibility pattern is not known should be cultured and susceptibility tested using rapid broth techniques. Measurement and subsequent adjustment of therapeutic drug concentrations may optimize therapy with second-line anti-TB drugs in TB meningitis. Better pediatric formulations and pharmacokinetic data for second-line and anti-TB therapeutic agents are needed.	meningitis; tuberculosis; ethionamide; cycloserine	CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; ADENOSINE-DEAMINASE; CHILDREN; DIAGNOSIS; RIFAMPICIN
10.1086_315054	"Transmission of a multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain resembling ""strain W"" among noninstitutionalized, human immunodeficiency virus-seronegative patients"	Since 1990, several outbreaks of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) have been described among institutionalized patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We describe a community MDR-TB outbreak among HIV-seronegative patients in Cape Town, South Africa. Isolates were characterized by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and dot-blot hybridization analysis of mutations conferring resistance for isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, and ethambutol, All isolates were identical on RFLP analysis, In 2 patients, RFLP analysis showed exogenous reinfection during or after treatment for drug-susceptible TB, Mutation analysis confirmed the genotypic identity of the isolates. The infecting strain was genotypically related to strain W which is responsible for the majority of MDR-TB outbreaks in New York City. Transmission of MDR-TB is thus not limited to HIV-seropositive patients in an institutional setting but occurs within a community.

pub-2035	Emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in a community-based directly observed treatment programme in rural South Africa	OBJECTIVE: Although little studied in developing countries, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is considered a major threat. We report the molecular epidemiology, clinical features and outcome of an emerging MDR-TB epidemic. METHODS: In 1996 all tuberculosis suspects in the rural Hlabisa district, South Africa, had sputum cultured, and drug susceptibility patterns of mycobacterial isolates were determined. Isolates with MDR-TB (resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin) were DNA fingerprinted by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) using IS6110 and polymorphic guanine-cytosine-rich sequence-based (PGRS) probes. Patients with MDR-TB were traced to determine outcome. Data were compared with results from a survey of drug susceptibility done in 1994. RESULTS: The rate of MDR-TB among smear-positive patients increased six-fold from 0.36% (1/275) in 1994 to 2.3% (13/561) in 1996 (P = 0.04). A further eight smear-negative cases were identified in 1996 from culture, six of whom had not been diagnosed with tuberculosis. MDR disease was clinically suspected in only five of the 21 cases (24%). Prevalence of primary and acquired MDR-TB was 1.8% and 4.1%, respectively. Twelve MDR-TB cases (67%) were in five RFLP-defined clusters. Among 20 traced patients, 10 (50%) had died, five had active disease (25%) and five (25%) were apparently cured. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of MDR-TB has risen rapidly in Hlabisa, apparently due to both reactivation disease and recent transmission. Many patients were not diagnosed with tuberculosis and many were not suspected of drug-resistant disease, and outcome was poor.	multidrug resistance; community treatment; DOT	DIRECTLY OBSERVED THERAPY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; BURDEN
10.1164_ajrccm.160.2.9901012	Outcome of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in France - A nationwide case-control study	The factors related to the outcome of 51 cases of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) reported in 1994 to the French National Reference Center were retrospectively analyzed. The patients (median age, 45 yr) were mainly male (75%), foreign-born (63%), and had pulmonary involvement (95%). Sixteen percent were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-coinfected. The number of drugs to which the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were susceptible was four. Only 82% of the patients have been hospitalized at any time (median duration, 33 d). Five patients (9%) received no antituberculosis drugs, although three had drug susceptibility results, indicating that two or more active drugs were available; 46 (91%) received drugs, including 37 who received two or more active drugs. Among the nine cases who received only one active drug, three had drug susceptibility results, indicating that two or more active drugs were available. By December 1996, 10 patients were lost before treatment completion, 24 had treatment failure, and 17 had a favorable outcome. The median survival time was 31 mo. Factors related to a poorer outcome were HIV-coinfection (hazard ratio [HR] = 41), treatment with less than two active drugs (HR = 9.9), and MDR status knowledge at the time of diagnosis (HR = 3.3). The country of birth was not associated with a poorer outcome. The management and outcome of MDR-TB in France has to be improved. A solution would be to develop a specialized unit or team for the treatment of MDR-TB, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).

pub-2038	Pattern of defervescence in response to anti tuberculosis therapy in patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis and advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection	The pattern of fever response to empiric anti-tuberculosis therapy in patients with tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HN) infection, and the relationship between fever response patterns and anti-TB drug susceptibility profiles of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates are rarely described. In this study, we evaluated the fever responses to a four-drug anti-TB regimen in 26 HPV-infected patients with culture-proven extrapulmonary TB, and compared the results with those in 12 patients with disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (DMAC) infection treated with a clarithromycin-containing regimen. The CD4 lymphocyte counts did not differ significantly between TB and DMAC patients (26 x 10(6)/L in TB patients vs 5 x 10(6)/L in DMAC patients). Drug susceptibility data were available for 22 patients with TB. Most TB patients had rapid defervescence after initiation of anti-TB therapy. Fever resolved within 1 week in 85% (22/26) of patients, including three of six (50%) with multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. The median duration of fever in patients with drug-susceptible TB was similar to that in patients with drug-resistant TB (3 vs 4 days, p = 0.33). However, patients with MDR-TB were more likely than those with non-MDR TB to have fevers lasting longer than 1 week after initiating anti-TB therapy (3/6 vs 1/16, p = 0.046). Only 17% (2/12) of the patients with DMAC infection became afebrile within 1 week of begining anti-MAC therapy (p < 0.001 vs those with TB). Our observations suggest that in HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression, anti-TB regimens achieve significantly faster defervescence in TB patients than do anti-MAC regimens in DMAC patients. Rapid defervescence in patients with TB does not necessarily indicate that TB isolates are not MDR strains.	human immunodeficiency virus; acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; tuberculosis; disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex; antimycobacterial therapy; fever response	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; AVIUM COMPLEX BACTEREMIA; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; HIV-INFECTION; AIDS PATIENTS; DIAGNOSIS; SURVIVAL; RIFAMPIN
10.1086_520189	A comparison of outbreak- and nonoutbreak-related multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients in a South African hospital	Nosocomial multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people is recognized in Europe and America, We report the first such outbreak in South Africa. Six hospitalized women, identified by DNA fingerprinting, were infected with an outbreak strain of MDR-TB while receiving treatment for drug-susceptible tuberculosis. The putative source case was identified as an HIV-positive woman who underwent prolonged hospitalization for chronic cavitary tuberculosis. Compared with other HIV-positive patients in the hospital, outbreak patients were more immunocompromised, had fewer cavitary lung changes, and were less likely to have been treated before. They had high fevers, infiltrative patterns on chest radiographs, and a mean survival of 43 days. When individual isolation is not possible, separating highly immunocompromised patients with first-time tuberculosis from previously treated patients with cavitary lesions and from those with established drug resistance may reduce nosocomial transmission.

pub-2040	Universal pattern of RpoB gene mutations among multidrug-resistant isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex from Africa	SETTING: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) presents an increasing burden in Southern Africa. Rapid diagnostic tests for drug resistance to rifampicin have been developed based on mutation analysis of the rpoB gene. However, geographic differences of underlying mutations have recently been suggested. OBJECTIVE: Drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex from Africa were analysed for geographic differences in frequency and location of rpoB mutations. DESIGN: A random sample of rifampicin-resistant strains was collected from 87 patients with pulmonary MDR-TB treated in 12 hospitals from six different regions of South Africa. In addition, 18 isolates of M. tuberculosis complex from Namibia, Sierra Leone, and Uganda, including 13 isolates of M. africanum, were analyzed. Point mutations were detected by direct sequence analysis of the rpoB gene. RESULTS: Missense mutations were identified for 91 isolates (87%). Double mutations were present in eight (8%) MDR-TB isolates, two of which carried one mutation outside a previously described diagnostic region. We found no geographic differences regarding the frequency and pattern of single rpoB gene mutations. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that molecular genetic analysis of rifampicin resistance based on a core region within the rpoB gene is universally applicable to strains of M. tuberculosis complex from different geographic regions.

pub-2041	Early results from indirect drug susceptibility test for tubercle bacilli	The indirect susceptibility test results on L-J medium for tubercle bacilli against streptomycin, isoniazid and rifampicin were read at the end of 2 wk and compared with the results at 4 wk. It was found that drug resistance could be correctly predicted in over 70 per cent of cultures including multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) strains at the end of 2 wk. The susceptibility to para-nitrobenzoic acid (PNB) read at 2 wk was able to distinguish non-tuberculous mycobacteria from Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures. The early detection of resistance by this procedure requires only minimum inputs, and can benefit the majority of patients harbouring drug resistant tubercle bacilli.	early detection of resistance; indirect sensitivity tests	TUBERCULOSIS; SENSITIVITY
10.1086_501627	Trends in compliance with the guidelines for preventing the transimission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis among New Jersey hospitals, 1989 to 1996	OBJECTIVE: To determine trends in compliance with the guidelines for preventing the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in healthcare facilities among New Jersey hospitals from 1989 through 1996. DESIGN: A voluntary questionnaire was sent to all 96 New Jersey hospitals in 1992. The 53 that responded were resurveyed in 1996. RESULTS: Of the 96 hospitals surveyed in 1992, 53 (55%) returned a completed questionnaire; 33 (64%) were community, nonteaching hospitals. In 1991, patients with tuberculosis (TB) were admitted at 38 (72%) of 53 hospitals, and from 1989 through 1991, patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB were admitted at 15 (29%) of 52 hospitals. Twenty-nine (57%) of 51 reported having rooms meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) isolation. A nonfitted surgical mask was used as a respiratory protective device by healthcare workers (HCWs) at 28 (55%) of 51 hospitals. Attending physicians were included in tuberculin skin-testing (TST) programs at 5 (11%) of 45 hospitals. In the 1996 resurvey, 48 (94%) of 53 surveyed hospitals returned a completed questionnaire; 34 (81%) of 42 had TB patient admissions, and 4 (9%) of 43 had MDR TB patient admissions in 1996. Forty-five (96%) of 47 reported having rooms that met CDC criteria for AFB isolation. N95 respiratory devices were used by HCWs at 45 (94%) of 48 hospitals. Attending physicians were included in the TST programs at 22 (54%) of 41 hospitals. CONCLUSION: New Jersey hospitals have made improvements in availability of AFB isolation rooms, use of proper respiratory protective devices, and expansion of TST programs for HCWs from 1989 through 1996.

pub-2043	Inadequacy of the current WHO re-treatment regimen in a central Siberian prison: treatment failure and MDR-TB	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) threatens the progress of global control efforts. Prisons represent a high risk setting for development and transmission of MDR-TB. In a Siberian TB referral prison (Kemerovo region), the treatment failure rate is 35% (June 1996-March 1997), despite implementation of a strict DOTS program and use of the World Health Organization Category 2 re-treatment regimen for all new cases. Among 164 patients (December 1997-March 1998), initial resistance to isoniazid and rifampin is 22.6%. Such a rate is a warning call to reconsider prison control strategies, and importantly, to address the treatment regimens necessary to combat an institutional epidemic of MDR-TB.	tuberculosis; multidrug resistance; prisons	RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS
pub-2044	Predictors for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among HIV-infected patients and response to specific drug regimens	SETTING: Mortality associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) related multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is reduced with effective early therapy. Identifying predictors of, and effective regimens for, MDR-TB is critical. OBJECTIVE: A multicenter prospective study was initiated to 1) determine the demographic, behavioral, clinical and geographic risk factors associated with the occurrence of MDR-TB among HIV-infected patients, and 2) to evaluate the overall survival and clinical response of MDR-TB patients treated with specific drug regimens. METHODS: Patients were prospectively evaluated for MDR-TB. Information included history of prior treatment for tuberculosis, close contact with a known case of MDR-TB, and residence in a facility with known or suspected MDR-TB transmission. Patients with known MDR-TB, or those suspected to be at high risk, were offered enrollment in a treatment pilot study. Study drugs included levofloxacin and at least two additional drugs to which the patient's isolate was known, or most likely, to be susceptible, Survival was the primary endpoint. RESULTS: Complete data are available for 156 HIV-infected patients with confirmed tuberculosis. Sixteen (10%) had MDR-TB, Only a history of prior tuberculosis treatment was associated with MDR-TB in multivariate analysis (OR = 4.4, P < 0.02), Twelve patients with MDR-TB enrolled in the treatment pilot had a median CD-I cell count of 51/mm(3). The cumulative probability of survival at one year was 75% (95% CI 50.5-99.5) and at 18 months, 65.6% (95% CI 38.1-93.1). Toxicity requiring discontinuation of medications occurred in two patients. CONCLUSIONS: A history of treatment for tuberculosis was the only predictor for MDR-TB in a cohort of HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis. In addition, this prospective study supports the results of prior retrospective studies that effective treatment impacts on mortality. Current second-line treatment, including high dose levofloxacin, appears to be reasonably well tolerated.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; HIV; levofloxacin; predictors	NEW-YORK-CITY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; IN-VITRO; LEVOFLOXACIN; TRANSMISSION
pub-2045	Outbreak of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis in Lisbon: detection by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis	SETTING: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) mainly among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive patients in Lisbon hospitals in 1996-1997. OBJECTIVE: Detection of transmission of MDR-TB strains and epidemic outbreaks in several hospital units in the city of Lisbon, including a prison hospital. DESIGN: Use of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to fingerprint isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin, and one other drug. RESULTS: A total of 43 MDR-TB strains were typed. Sixty-seven per cent of the patients were HIV positive, 12% were HIV negative, and the remainder had unknown HIV status. About 88% of the isolates were grouped in three genetically similar clusters, suggesting possible recent transmission. A predominant cluster (cluster A), corresponding to 72% of the cases, was found, 45% of which came from the prison hospital. Strains from this cluster were resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, and sometimes ethambutol. A retrospective epidemiological investigation was conducted with respect to all patients in cluster A, and epidemiological links mere established between them. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest recent transmission of MDR-TB, mainly in HIV-positive patients, in Lisbon hospitals. Moreover, the predominant MDR-TB clustered strains were not confined to HIV-infected individuals, as they were also isolated in some immunocompetent patients.	tuberculosis; multi-drug resistance (MDR); RFLP; outbreak; Lisbon	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; STRAINS; TOOL; STABILITY; INFECTION
pub-2046	Phase II trial of recombinant interferon-alpha 2b in patients with advanced intractable multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis: long-term follow-up	SETTING: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, with Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to almost all of the available drugs. OBJECTIVE: Limited phase II trial with recombinant interferon-alpha 2b in five chronic multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients. METHODS: Three million units of r-IFN-alpha 2b were administered subcutaneously every week for 12 weeks. Before and after treatment, and during a 30-month follow-up period, the patients underwent clinical and radiological examination, together with bacteriological, immunological and routine laboratory testing. RESULTS: Two Of the five patients became long-term sputum smear and culture negative after r-IFN-alpha 2b therapy; one of the patients showed clinical improvement and negative smear after therapy, but remained culture positive. The other two patients showed no response. CONCLUSION: The results of this trial suggest that IFN-alpha 2b should be evaluated further in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis ill prospective controlled trials.

10.1089_mdr.1998.4.263	Comparison of PCR-heteroduplex characterization by automated DNA sequencing and line probe assay for the detection of rifampicin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa	Progress in understanding the basis of resistance to rifampicin (Rif(R)) has allowed molecular tests for the detection of drug-resistant tuberculosis to be developed. One hundred thirteen strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were investigated for genotypic analysis of Rif(R) by polymerase chain reaction-heteroduplex formation (PCR-HDF) and characterization of mutations by automated DNA sequencing of the rpoB gene. A subset of isolates (22) representative of different mutations as confirmed by sequence analysis were also evaluated by the Line Probe Assay (LiPA). In 106 of the RIP strains, 24 mutations within an 81-bp region of the rpoB gene affecting 13 amino acids were observed, Most isolates (7/8) harboring Leu(533) --> Pro codon mutation required minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of less than or equal to 8 mu g/ml. There was geographic variation in the frequency of occurrence of particular rpoB mutations, with the Ser(531) --> Leu/Trp codon mutation found in 59/113 of isolates. Although there are certain Limitations in the use of both the rapid PCR-HDF diagnostic assay and the LiPA for the detection of rifampicin susceptibility of M. tuberculosis, these provide important and convenient tools for identifying and managing patients with MDR-TB.

pub-2048	Outcome of second-line tuberculosis treatment in migrants from Vietnam	From 1990 to 1995, 410 441 prospective migrants were screened for tuberculosis (TB) in Ho-Chi-Minh City (Vietnam), within the framework of the Orderly Departure Programme. 161 individuals had multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB and were treated with a seven-drug regimen (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, capreomycin, cycloserine, and ethionamide) for at least 12 months. In January 1996, 31 of these patients were still on treatment. The cumulative percentage of cure was 21% at 18 months, 71.6% at 36 months, and 81.2% at 55 months. Sex, age, presence of cavities, and previous tuberculosis treatment did not affect the chance of cure, but age > 45 years significantly affected the chance of treatment failure (nonadherence, death, treatment stopped due to side effects).	tuberculosis; immigrants and emigrants; Vietnam	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS

pub-2050	Outcome of chemotherapy in 107 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid and rifampin	SETTING: National Masan Tuberculosis Hospital, Korea. OBJECTIVE: Treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is considered to be clinically important, but there are few reports on this topic. We therefore retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of chemotherapy only for pulmonary MDR-TB. DESIGN: We reviewed the clinical courses of 107 patients with pulmonary disease due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to rifampin and isoniazid who were under follow-up between March 1996 and June 1996 after hospitalization between January 1993 and January 1996. We performed a retrospective cohort study for all the patients' records. Their regimens were selected individually and preferably included four medications that they had not been given previously and to which the strain was fully susceptible. RESULTS: The 107 patients (mean age 38.3 years) had previously received a mean of five drugs, and were shedding bacilli that were resistant to a mean of four drugs. Of 63 patients with sufficient follow-up data, 52 (82.5%) responded to chemotherapy (as indicated by negative sputum cultures for at least three consecutive months); 11 (17.5%) had no response, as shown by continually positive cultures. In a univariate analysis, an unfavorable response was significantly associated with resistance to a greater number of drugs before the current courses of treatment (relative risk 21.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2-3.0; P < 0.05). The mean period of follow-up was 17 months. There was no subsequent relapse among the patients with responses, and there were no tuberculosis-related deaths. CONCLUSION: In this study, multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis responded relatively well to carefully selected regimens.

10.1258_0956462981922809	Cytomegalovirus pp65 antigenaemia as an indicator of end-organ disease in AIDS	We aim to assess the usefulness of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 antigenaemia test, also called the CMV direct antigen test (DAT), in the management of patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; we studied all patients who had pp65 assays between 8 September 1995 and 30 August 1996. Twenty-three patients had 31 tests. The mean CD4 cell count was 20/mm(3). The tests were negative in 16 patients, of whom 12 have not developed CMV end-organ disease after a mean follow up of 114 days (range 14-269 days), whilst the remaining 4 patients had previously treated CMV disease. Eleven patients had positive tests: 4 had active CMV disease, 2 subsequently developed CMV retinitis, 2 died within a fortnight of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), one was lost to follow up and 2 have remained disease-free. This test has a positive predictive value of 43% and a negative predictive value of 94%, Fisher's exact test P=0.03. The pp65 antigenaemia assay can be performed in a standard virology laboratory avoiding the problems associated with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a result is available within 5 h, and it is semi-quantifiable. However, a large prospective study is required to determine the comparative value and roles of the pp65 antigenaemia assay and DNA PCR in the management of CMV disease, especially with regard to the use of primary prophylaxis and preemptive therapy.	cytomegalovirus; antigens; AIDS	CMV ANTIGENEMIA ASSAY; HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS; DIAGNOSIS; BLOOD
pub-2052	In vitro activity of antimicrobial combinations against clinical isolates of susceptible and resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis	SETTING: University of Texas Medical Branch, Clinical Microbiology Laboratory. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in vitro the activity of rifabutin plus each of four other antimicrobial agents: isoniazid, amoxicillin/clavulanate, sparfloxacin and clarithromycin, against five susceptible (S-MTB) and five multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. DESIGN: The antimicrobial activity of each two-drug combination was assessed by macrodilution checkerboard technique using Bactec 460 and classified as synergistic, additive, or antagonistic, using the fractional inhibitory concentration index. RESULTS: For S-MTB, rifabutin + amoxicillin/clavulanate, rifabutin + isoniazid, rifabutin + sparfloxacin and rifabutin + clarithromycin acted synergistically against four, three, one and one isolate, respectively; clarithromycin + rifabutin was additive for one isolate. None of the combinations were antagonistic against S-MTB. For MDR-TB, rifabutin + amoxicillin/clavulanate, rifabutin + isoniazid, rifabutin + sparfloxacin and rifabutin + clarithromycin acted synergistically against one, one, one and two isolates, respectively, and additively against two, one, one and two isolates, respectively. Rifabutin + amoxicillin/clavulanate, rifabutin + isoniazid, and rifabutin + clarithromycin were antagonistic against one, two and two MDR-TB isolates, respectively. CONCLUSION: Certain drug combinations acted synergistically against MDR-TB; however, the clinical predictive value of these in vitro experiments is unknown.

pub-2053	Drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated from re-treatment cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in Ethiopia: susceptibility to first-line and alternative drugs	SETTING: Addis Ababa Tuberculosis Demonstration and Training Center, Ethiopia. OBJECTIVES: To determine the pattern of drug resistance among re-treatment cases of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), to determine the risk factors associated with multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB, and to propose re-treatment regimens based on the patterns of susceptibility to first-line and alternative drugs. DESIGN: One hundred and seven Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated from an equal number of re-treatment cases of pulmonary TB were included in the study. Drug susceptibility was determined by the Bactec method. RESULTS: About 50% of the strains were resistant to one or more of the first-line drugs and 12% of the strains were multi-drug resistant, i.e., resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin. Previous treatment with rifampicin was the most important predictor of MDR-TB. All MDR strains were susceptible to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, ethambutol, ethionamide and clofazimine. CONCLUSION: The WHO re-treatment regimen would theoretically be effective for the treatment of all non-MDR-TB patients in this study. A proposed 12-month re-treatment regimen for MDR-TB patients would include a fluoroquinolone in combination with streptomycin, pyrazinamide, isoniazid, ethambutol and clofazimine. There is an urgent need for more research to define safe and inexpensive treatment regimens for MDR-TB patients in low-income countries.	multidrug resistance; tuberculosis; Ethiopia	
pub-2054	Comparison of three molecular assays for rapid detection of rifampin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is an emerging problem of great importance to public health, with higher mortality rates than drug-sensitive TB, particularly in immunocompromised patients. MDR-TB patients require treatment with more-toxic second-line drugs and remain infectious for longer than patients infected with drug-sensitive strains, incurring higher costs due to prolonged hospitalization. It is estimated that 90% of United Kingdom rifampin-resistant isolates are also resistant to isoniazid, making rifampin resistance a useful surrogate marker for multidrug resistance and indicating that second-and third-line drugs to which these isolates are susceptible are urgently required. Resistance in approximately 95% of rifampin-resistant isolates is due to mutations in a 69-bp region of the rpoB gene, making this a good target for molecular genotypic diagnostic methods, Two molecular assays, INNO-LiPA Rif,TB (Innogenetics, Zwijndrecht, Belgium) and MisMatch Detect II (Ambion, Austin, Tex,), were performed on primary specimens and cultures to predict rifampin resistance, and these methods were compared with the resistance ratio method. A third method, the phenotypic PhaB assay, was also evaluated in comparison to cultures in parallel with the genotypic assays. In an initial evaluation 16 of 16, 15 of 16, and 16 of 16 rifampin-resistant cultures (100, 93.8, and 100%, respectively), were correctly identified by line probe assay (LiPA), mismatch assay, and PhaB assay, respectively. Subsequently 38 sputa and bronchealveolar lavage specimens and 21 isolates were received from clinicians for molecular analysis, For the 38 primary specimens the LiPA and mismatch assay correlated with culture and subsequent identification and susceptibility tests in 36 and 38 specimens (94.7 and 100%), respectively. For the 21 isolates submitted by clinicians, both assays correlated 100% with routine testing.		STRAND CONFORMATION POLYMORPHISM; AVIUM COMPLEX; BETA-SUBUNIT; MUTATIONS; SINGLE; MORTALITY; GENE; PCR
10.1007_s001470050147	Fatal primary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in a heart transplant recipient	The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) worldwide is currently on the rise, not only in the general population but also quite notably among immunosuppressed patients. Its incidence among patients undergoing antirejection therapy is considerably higher than in the general population, and heart transplant recipients have been found to carry the highest risk of TB. There are no reported data, however, on primary TB caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) in heart transplant recipients. We describe the case of a patient who developed active primary MDR TB following the reactivation of a latent tuberculous infection 6 months after transplantation. The patient was most likely infected by M. tuberculosis during a period of time he spent in prison 10 years before undergoing transplantation, but he never developed active tuberculosis, nor did he ever receive antituberculous medication prior to transplantation. Because of the atypical clinical presentation, establishment of the diagnosis was postponed, and the resistance pattern of the isolate grown from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens (resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin) led to treatment failure and a fatal outcome. The adoption of the most rapid diagnostic tools for the identification of M. tuberculosis and for a quick screening of drug-resistant isolates is urgently needed in those centers where organ transplantation is carried out.	tuberculosis; heart transplantation	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; RIFAMPICIN-RESISTANCE; SPECIMENS; PCR
10.1097_00002030_199809000_00017	An outbreak of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis involving HIV-infected patients of two hospitals in Milan, Italy	Objective: To describe an outbreak of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), amongst HIV-infected patients, spread from one hospital in Milan to another. Design: Descriptive epidemiological investigation and molecular typing. Methods: All cases identified by intensive case-finding were described in terms of clinical characteristics, previous nosocomial exposure to an infectious MDR-TB patient, previous stays in other institutional settings where exposure to MDR-TB could have occurred, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) pattern. Results: Between October 1991 and July 1995, 116 cases of MDR-TB were identified (85 at hospital A and 31 at hospital B). A single case patient, infected at hospital A, introduced the strain into hospital B. Eighty-two of the 92 strains available for fingerprinting revealed an identical pattern; 10 strains had unique RFLP patterns. Nosocomial exposure to an infectious MDR-TB patient was ascertained for 39 of the 56 patients with the 'outbreak' RFLP strain at hospital A (69.6%) and for 24 of the 26 patients at hospital B (92.3%). The median duration of exposure was 32 days at hospital A and 40 days at hospital B. For eight patients with the outbreak strain, exposure was determined to have probably occurred in other hospitals, in the community or in prison. Conclusions: This is the largest nosocomial outbreak of MDR-TB reported in Europe. Exposure to MDR-TB cases in other institutions caring for HIV-infected patients probably contributed to the spread of this epidemic. Strict control measures should be immediately adopted in order to prevent the spread of TB amongst HIV-infected patients in institutional settings in Europe.

pub-2057	Differential gene expression in response to adjunctive recombinant human interleukin-2 immunotherapy in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients	Administration of low-dose recombinant human interleukin 2 (rhuIL-2) in combination with multidrug chemotherapy to patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) induces measurable changes in in vitro immune response parameters which are associated with changes in the clinical and bacteriologic status of the patients. To determine the molecular basis of these changes, we have used semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-initiated PCR (RT-PCR) and differential display technology. During rhuIL-2 treatment of MDR TB patients, decreased levels of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) relative to baseline levels were observed. However, at the site of a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD), the expression of cellular IFN-gamma and IL-2 mRNAs was increased during rhuIL-2 therapy. Levels of other cytokine mRNAs were not significantly affected by rhuIL-2 administration. Using differential-display RT-PCR, we identified several genes expressed at the DTH skin test site which were up-or down-regulated during rhuIL-2 treatment. Cytochrome oxidase type I mRNA was increased in response to rhuIL-2, therapy relative to baseline levels, as was heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein G mRNA. CD63, clathrin heavy chain, and beta-adaptin mRNAs, all of which encode proteins associated with the endocytic vacuolar pathway of cells, were also differentially regulated by rhuIL-2 administration. The differential effects of IL-2 were confirmed in vitro by using PBMC obtained from PPD-positive individuals stimulated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and IL-2. The differential expression of genes may provide a surrogate marker for leukocyte activation at a mycobacterial antigen-specific response site and for the development of an enhanced antimicrobial response which may result in improved outcomes in MDR TB patients.

pub-2058	Drug-resistant tuberculosis in the Dominican Republic: results of a nationwide survey	SETTING: The Dominican Republic. OBJECTIVE: TO assess the extent of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) following the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO)/International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) new global surveillance project on drug resistance in TB. METHODS: Using a multi-step proportional weighted approach, a sample of 688 sequential cases of smear positive pulmonary TB diagnosed between April 1994 and April 1995 was studied in six of the country's eight health regions. Pre-treatment sputum samples were cultured on Loewenstein-Jensen medium and drug susceptibility tests were performed using the economic variant of the proportion method. RESULTS: Of 420 cases with drug susceptibility results, resistance to one or more drugs was observed in 43.8%; resistance was found in 52.1% of 117 TB cases with a history of previous antituberculosis treatment and in 40.6% of 303 new TB cases. In five of the six health regions surveyed, greater than or equal to 41% of strains were resistant to one or more drugs. Multidrug resistance (MDR) to isoniazid and rifampicin with or without resistance to other drugs was found in 43 (10.2%) of 420 cases, including 6.6% of new TB cases. In five of the six health regions greater than or equal to 8% of strains were classified as MDR. Independent predictors of MDR-TB included being in the age group 25 to 44 years (odds ratio [OR] = 4.2, 35% confidence interval [CI] 1.5, 11.6; P = 0.005), being aged 45 years and over (OR = 4.5, 35% CI 1.4, 14.4; P = 0.003), and having a prior history of TB (OR = 3.7, 95% CI 1.9, 7.4; P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The proportion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to one or more anti-TB drugs in the Dominican Republic is among the highest observed world-wide. The severity of the problem urgently requires the full implementation of TB control strategies endorsed by the WHO and the IUATLD, which include political commitment to a National TB Program, case detection utilizing sputum-smear microscopy, directly observed treatment, regular drug supply, and standardised recording and reporting systems. Also, the sale of TB drugs in the private market should be controlled.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; surveillance; Dominican Republic	SURVEILLANCE
10.1016_S0195_6701_98_90324_3	An outbreak of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in a London teaching hospital	We describe the epidemiology and control of a hospital outbreak of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative patient with drug-sensitive tuberculosis developed MDR-TB during a period of unsupervised therapy. She was admitted to an isolation room in a ward with HIV-positive patients, but the room, unbeknown to hospital staff, was at positive-pressure relative to the main ward. Seven HIV-positive contacts developed MDR-TB. The diagnosis in the second patient was delayed, partly because acid-fast bacilli in his sputum were assumed to be Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare. All the available Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were indistinguishable by molecular typing. Nearly 1400 staff and patient contacts were offered screening, but the screening programme detected only one of the cases. Despite therapy, the index patient and two of the contacts died. HIV-positive patients are more likely than others to develop tuberculosis after exposure, and the disease may progress more rapidly. In these patients the possibility that acid-fast bacilli may represent M. tuberculosis must always be considered. Patients with tuberculosis (suspected or proven) should not be nursed in the same wards as immunosuppressed patients, and should be isolated. MDR-TB cases must be isolated in negative-pressure rooms. Hospital siderooms may be positive-pressure as a fire safety measure; infection control teams must be aware of the airflows in all isolation rooms, and must be consulted during the design of hospital buildings. Good communication between infection control teams and clinicians is important, and all medical and nursing staff must be aware of the principles of management of patients with proven or suspected tuberculosis and MDR-TB.	tuberculosis; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; drug resistance; cross-infection; infection control; HIV; airflow; isolation; supervised therapy; contact tracing; typing	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; TRANSMISSION; THERAPY
pub-2060	Drug-resistant tuberculosis in human immunodeficiency virus infected persons in Italy	OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence and epidemiological-clinical characteristics of tuberculosis (TB) resistance to first-line drugs in Italian human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects. DESIGN: Prospective, observational multicenter (25 Centers of Infectious Diseases) study. Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains from 167 HIV co-infected subjects with TB (149 new cases, 18 relapses) were tested at a central laboratory for susceptibility to rifampin (R), isoniazid (H), pyrazinamide (Z), ethambutol (E) and streptomycin (S) and for DNA fingerprint type. Drug susceptibility results were related to patients' epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features. RESULTS: Drug resistance patterns among new TB cases were as follows: R = 1%, Z = 6%, S = 8%, H + S = 3%, S + Z = 4%. TB resistant to at least R + H (MDR-TB) was detected in 36% of new cases due to an MDR-TB outbreak which was the largest thus far in Europe, involving 7/25 participating institutions, and was demonstrated by conventional and molecular epidemiology evidence. With multivariate analysis, MDR-TB was associated with hospital exposure to MDR-TB (OR = 39.3, P < 0.001) and previous use of anti-TB drugs (OR = 9.8, P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: As drug-resistant tuberculosis in Italy is thus far relatively scarce, detection of a large MDR-TB epidemic among HIV-infected subjects was alarming. Aggressive control measures are urgently needed to prevent the spread of MDR-TB throughout the country and among the general population.	drug-resistant tuberculosis; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; HIV	NEW-YORK-CITY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; HIV-INFECTION; TRANSMISSION; OUTBREAK
10.1093_ije_27.1.121	Epidemiology of drug-resistant tuberculosis in New Jersey from 1991 to 1995	Background In a nationwide survey in 1991, the proportion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin (MDR-TB) in New Jersey (6.6%) was ranked second highest in the United States. The objectives of this study were to describe drug-resistant TB trend and to investigate risk factors for TB patients with isolates resistant to isoniazid or rifampin or both. Methods TB surveillance data in New Jersey from 1991-1995 were analysed. Data on Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture and drug susceptibility testing of all TB isolates were obtained from public health and clinical laboratories. Logistic regression was performed to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and to adjust for potential confounders. Results From 1991 to 1995, the proportion of MDR-TB was 5.7%, 4.1%, 2.7%, 3.3% and 2.6%, respectively. There was 10.6% isoniazid resistance and 4.3% rifampin resistance among TB patients in 1993-1995. As expected, recurrent TB was the most important risk factor for resistance to isoniazid (OR = 4.5, 95% CI:2.6-7.6), rifampin (OR = 5.5, 95% CI: 2.8-11) or both (OR = 6.1, 95% CI:2.9-13). HIV infection was significantly associated with MDR-TB (OR = 3.6, 95% CI: 1.5-8.8). Drug resistance was not found to be significantly associated with homelessness, injecting drug use and excess alcohol use. Conclusions The proportion of MDR-TB in New Jersey declined significantly from 1991 to 1993, but remained at a plateau from 1993-1995. The results suggest that continuous efforts should be directed at the prevention of MDR-TB among people infected with HIV and at improving the proportion who complete chemotherapy among those with TB.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; trend; risk factors	NEW-YORK-CITY; ACQUIRED-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-SYNDROME; HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; UNITED-STATES; OUTBREAK; TRANSMISSION; EMERGENCE
10.1001_jama.278.13.1073	Transmission of a highly drug-resistant strain (strain W1) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis - Community outbreak and nosocomial transmission via a contaminated bronchoscope	Context.-Nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) has been reported primarily in New York State and has generally been presumed to occur via respiratory aerosols. Objective.-To assess nosocomial transmission of MDR TB. In 1995, 8 patients with MDR TB were identified in South Carolina; all were resistant to 7 drugs and had matching DNA fingerprints (strain W1). Community links were identified for 5 patients (Patients 1-5). However, no links were identified for the other 3 patients (Patients 6-8) except being hospitalized at the same hospital as 1 community patient. Design.-Outbreak investigation. Setting.-Community and hospital. Patients.-Eight patients whose MDR TB isolates had DNA fingerprint patterns matching strain W1. Main Outcome Measures.-Clinical characteristics of patients with strain W1 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. Results.-Patient 5 (community patient) and Patient 8, diagnosed April 1995 and November 1995, respectively, had clinical courses consistent with MDR TB, with smear-positive and culture-positive specimens and cavitary lesions on chest radiograph; both died of MDR TB less than 1 month after diagnosis. Patients 6 and 7 (diagnosed May 1995) each had 1 positive culture for MDR TB; specimens were collected during bronchoscopy. Patient 6 had a skin test conversion after bronchoscopy. Neither Patient 6 nor Patient 7 had a clinical course consistent with MDR TB, neither was treated for MDR TB, and both are alive and well. No evidence of laboratory contamination of specimens, transmission on inpatient wards, or contact among patients was found. All 4 received bronchoscopies in May 1995; Patients 6, 7, and 8 had bronchoscopies 1, 12, and 17 days, respectively, after Patient 5. Observations revealed that bronchoscope cleaning was inadequate, and the bronchoscope was never immersed in disinfectant. Conclusions.-Inadequate cleaning and disinfection of the bronchoscope after the procedure performed on Patient 5 led to subsequent false-positive cultures in Patients 6 and 7 and transmission of infection to Patient 6 and active MDR TB to Patient 8.

10.1001_jama.278.10.833	Trends in drug-resistant tuberculosis in the United States, 1993-1996	Context.-With the resurgence of tuberculosis (TB) disease in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the United States, multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB emerged as a serious challenge to TB control. In response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1993 added drug susceptibility test results to the information collected for the national surveillance system to monitor trends in drug resistance. Objective.-To determine the extent of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in the United States. Design.-Descriptive analysis or TB surveillance data. Study Population.-Patients reported to the national TB surveillance system as confirmed TB cases with culture-positive disease from 1993 through 1996 by the 50 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia (DC). Main Outcome Measure.-Percentage of case patients with culture-positive disease whose isolates are resistant to specific anti-TB drugs. Results.-Overall resistance to at least isoniazid was 8.4%; rifampin, 3.0%; both isoniazid and rifampin (ie, MDR TB), 2.2%; pyrazinamide, 3.0%; streptomycin, 6.2%; and ethambutol hydrochloride, 2.2%. Rates of resistance were significantly higher for case patients with a prior TB episode. Among those without prior TB, isoniazid resistance of 4% or more was found in 41 states, New York City, and DC. A total of 1457 MDR TB cases were reported from 42 states, New York City, and DC; however, 38% were reported from New York City. Rates of isoniazid and streptomycin resistance were higher for cases among US-born compared with foreign-born patients, but rates of rifampin resistance and MDR TB were similar. Among US-born patients, resistance to first-line drugs, particularly rifampin mono-resistance, was significantly higher among those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Conclusions.-Compared with recent US surveys in 1991 and 1992, isoniazid resistance has remained relatively stable. In addition, the percentage of MDR TB has decreased, although the national trend was significantly influenced by the marked decrease in New York City. Foreign-born and HIV-positive patients and those with prior TB have higher rates of resistance. The widespread extent of isoniazid resistance confirms the need for drug susceptibility testing to guide optimal treatment of patients with culture-positive disease.

pub-2064	Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Denmark 1993-1995	SETTING: All bacteriologically confirmed new cases of tuberculosis and treatment relapses in Denmark are examined for drug resistance. In the years 1993-1995, nine cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), all acquired outside Denmark, were identified among 1354 cases of tuberculosis. OBJECTIVE: To examine incidence, treatment and prognosis for patients with tuberculosis due to MDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis. DESIGN: Retrospective evaluation of routine data. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Multidrug resistance was present in less than one percent of patients with tuberculosis. One patient died from tuberculosis without revision of treatment, and eight patients responded favourably to a regimen of pyrazinamide, streptomycin or amikacin, ofloxacin and cycloserine. In two patients, this regimen was supplemented with para-aminosalicylic acid and thiacetazone respectively. All patients needed prolonged hospitalization and had observed treatment. It is possible to cure such patients, but it is a lengthy and expensive process. It is expected that similar cases will be imported into the country and that they will occur within Denmark in the future.	tuberculosis; multidrug resistance; national survey	NEW-YORK-CITY
pub-2065	Risk factors and outcome of human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with sporadic multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in New York City	SETTING: An 880 bed university teaching hospital in New York City. OBJECTIVE: To assess risk factors and outcome for sporadic cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. DESIGN: In a retrospective cohort analysis, 13 HIV-positive patients with MDR-TB (cases) diagnosed between January 1991 and December 1993 were compared to 31 HIV-infected patients with susceptible or single drug-resistant tuberculosis (controls) diagnosed during the same time period to assess for differences in risk factors and outcome. RESULTS: Risk factors for MDR-TB included homosexual contact as a risk for HIV transmission, prior anti-retroviral therapy and Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis. Fatality rates were 62% for MDR-TB patients and 26% for controls (P < 0.04). The median survival time was 5.8 months for cases and 9.8 months for controls. Risk factors associated with death included multidrug-resistance and CD4-lymphocyte counts below 200. CONCLUSION: Sporadic MDR-TB infection in HIV-infected patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality compared to infection with susceptible or single-drug-resistant TB. The median survival for HIV-infected patients with MDR-TB in this study is, however, two to three times longer than previously reported in MDR-TB outbreaks.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; HIV; MDR-TB; outcome	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; UNITED-STATES; HIV-INFECTION; TRANSMISSION; OUTBREAK; EPIDEMIOLOGY; BACILLI
pub-2066	A retrospective study of human immunodeficiency virus infection and drug-resistant tuberculosis in Durban, South Africa	SETTING: King George V hospital, a specialist referral hospital for tuberculosis (TB) patients in Durban, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between drug-resistant TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive study of 295 patient records, for the period January 1991 to April 1994, which were reviewed to collect data on HIV status, drug susceptibility and outcome as well as age, race, gender and previous TB treatment. RESULTS: Overall, 42 patients (14.2%) were HIV-seropositive while the rate of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was 10.2%. Of those previously treated, 6.1% were HIV-seropositive while of those with no known history of previous TB, 5.4% were HIV-seropositive. A history of previous antituberculosis treatment was the strongest predictor for the presence of organisms resistant (Odds Ratio = 3.1; P = 0.0016) to one or more of the antituberculosis drugs. The prevalence of HIV infection was 13.1% in patients with drug-resistant TB and 14.9% in patients with drug-sensitive TB. CONCLUSION: The HIV epidemic has not exacerbated the occurrence of drug-resistant TB. History of previous TB treatment, and not HIV infection, was the principal factor associated with TB which is resistant to at least one primary anti-TB drug. However, as the HIV epidemic progresses in a milieu of high TB prevalence, the link with drug-resistant TB warrants constant monitoring and investigation.	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; HIV	NEW-YORK-CITY; HIV-INFECTION; OUTBREAK
10.1016_S0140_6736_96_12273_X	Treatment of multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis with interferon-gamma via aerosol	Background Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is associated with substantial morbidity, despite drug therapy. Interferon-gamma, a cytokine produced mainly by CD4 T lymphocytes, can activate alveolar macrophages, important effector cells in host immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We investigated safety and tolerability of aerosolised interferon-gamma in patients with MDR-TB, and assessed its efficacy in terms of sputum-smear grades. Methods We did an open-label trial of aerosol interferon-gamma given to five patients with smears and cultures positive for pulmonary MDR-TB, despite documented adherence to therapy. The patients received aerosol interferon-gamma 500 mu g three times a week for 1 month. Safety and tolerability were assessed, and, as well as routine clinical assessments, sputum samples for smear and culture were collected al entry and weekly. Computed tomography scans of the chest were done at baseline and after therapy ended, Findings Interferon-gamma was well tolerated by ail patients, In ail five, bodyweight stabilised or increased. Sputum acid-fast-bacillus smears became negative in all patients, and the time to positive culture increased (from 17 to 24 days, not significant), which suggested that the mycobacterial burden had decreased. The size of cavitary lesions was reduced in all patients, 2 months after treatment had ended. Interpretation Preliminary data suggest that aerosol interferon-gamma is a weil-tolerated treatment that may be useful as adjunctive therapy in patients with MDR-IB who are otherwise not responding well to therapy.

10.1378_chest.111.5.1162	Retreatment tuberculosis cases - Factors associated with drug resistance and adverse outcomes	Study objective: Risk factors associated with treatment failure and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) were examined among HIV-seronegative patients who were previously treated for tuberculosis (TB). Design: Prospective, cohort study of patients referred to the study hospital for retreatment of TB between March 1986 and March 1990. Patients: The patients belonged to three groups, according to outcomes following their previous treatment: 37 patients who abandoned treatment car suffered release after completion of therapy (group A), 91 patients who failed to respond to the first-line drug regimen (group B), and 78 patients who failed to respond to the second-line drug regimen (group C), Results: Patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to rifampin and isoniazid were found in 2 (6%) in group A, 29 (33%) in group B, and 49 (65%) in group C, Cure was achieved in 77% in group A, 54% in group B, and 36% in group C. Death occurred in none of the patients in group A, 8% in group B, and 24% in group C. Inn a multivariate logistic regression analysis, unfavorable response (failure to sterilize sputum culture, death, and abandonment) was significantly associated with infection with a multidrug-resistant M tuberculosis strain (p = 0.0002), cavitary disease (p = 0.0029), or irregular use of medications (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: These observations show that a previous treatment outcome and current clinical and epidemiologic histories can be used to predict the development of MDR-TB and adverse outcomes in patients undergoing retreatment for TB. Such information may be useful for identifying appropriate patient candidates for programs such as directly observed therapy.

10.1183_09031936.97.10051120	Rapid detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Transmission of multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) presents a serious problem for infection control in hospitals, particularly in the context of co-infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We report on the use of molecular genetic tools to allow rapid assessment of samples from patients potentially infected with MDR-TB. Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were obtained from two HIV-positive patients with suspected tuberculosis, who had previous contact with a known MDR-TB index case, Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used directly on clinical samples to amplify genetic loci associated with rifampicin resistance (rpoB), and strain-specific polymorphisms (the direct repeat (DR) region), Drug resistance was determined using a commercially available kit for detection of point mutations in the rpoB gene (Inno-Lipa RifTB; Innogenetics, Belgium), and confirmed by nucleotide sequencing, Strain variation was determined using the spoligotyping method, based on the presence or absence of variable linker sequences within the DR region. In one patient, infection with a MDR strain identical to that of a known index case was demonstrated, A second patient, although positive for M. tuberculosis, was found to be infected with a rifampicin-sensitive strain. Results were obtained within 48 h, allowing appropriate treatment to be initiated and infection control measures to be implemented. PCR-based tests for strain-typing and for identification of rifampicin resistance provide important tools for identifying patients with h MDR-TB and for rapid monitoring of potential nosocomial spread of MDR-TB, Prompt confirmation or exclusion of possible transmission allows early clinical intervention to prevent future outbreaks of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis.	direct repeat; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; polymerase chain reaction; rifampicin; rpoB gene; spoligotyping	POLYMERASE CHAIN-REACTION; HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS; NEW-YORK-CITY; POLYMORPHIC DNA ANALYSIS; HEALTH-CARE WORKERS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; NOSOCOMIAL TRANSMISSION; STRAIN DIFFERENTIATION; GENE; DISCRIMINATION
pub-2070	A city-wide outbreak of a multiple-drug-resistant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in New York	SETTING: Incident patients with active tuberculosis (TB) resistant to two or more drugs in New York City hospitals in 1992. OBJECTIVE: To examine the New York-wide distribution of Public Health Research Institute (PHRI) strain W of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an extremely drug-resistant strain identified by a 17-band Southern hybridization pattern using IS6110, during the peak tuberculosis year of 1992. We also compared strain W with other strains frequently observed: in New York. DESIGN: Blinded retrospective study of stored M. tuberculosis cultures by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) DNA fingerprinting, and chart review. RESULTS: We found 112 cultures with the strain W fingerprint and 8 variants in 21 hospitals among incident patients hospitalized in 1992. Almost all isolates were resistant to four first-line drugs and kanamycin. This single strain made up at least 22% of New York City multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) TB in 1992, far more than any other strain. Almost all W-strain cases were acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. The cluster is the most drug-resistant cluster identified in New York and the largest IS6110 fingerprint cluster identified anywhere to date. CONCLUSION: Because recommended four-drug therapy will not sterilise this very resistant strain, there was a city-wide nosocomial outbreak of W-strain TB in the early 1990s among New York AIDS patients. Other frequently seen strains were either also very resistant, or, surprisingly, pansusceptible. Individual MDR strains can be spread widely in situations where AIDS and TB are both common.	tuberculosis; drug resistance; multiple drug resistance (MDR); outbreak; New York	HIV-INFECTION; TRANSMISSION; EMERGENCE; TRENDS
pub-2071	Cycloserine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome in an AIDS patient with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	We report a case of cycloserine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) in a 38-year-old male with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The patient developed a cutaneous reaction after 60 days of therapy with ofloxacin, streptomycin (SM), pyrazinamide (PZA), ethambutol (EMB), and cycloserine (CSN). All drugs were stopped and the rash improved. Due to the severity of his disease, anti-tuberculosis drugs were resumed, one at a time. The patient developed a recurrent rash consistent with SJS, which began when CSN was restarted. CSN was stopped and the SJS began to gradually resolve with palliative treatment despite continuation of the other anti-tuberculosis drugs. However, the patient's overall condition gradually deteriorated and he died. To our knowledge, this is the first case of probable CSN-related SJS.	cycloserine; Stevens-Johnson syndrome; AIDS; MDR-TB	TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS; ERYTHEMA MULTIFORME; DRUGS; GERMANY
pub-2072	Nature of drug resistance and predictors of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among patients seen at the Philippine General Hospital, Manila, Philippines	SETTING: This Study was conducted at the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH), Manila, Philippines. OBJECTIVES: To determine the nature of drug resistance among patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and to establish clinical predictors of drug-resistant tuberculosis. DESIGN: Descriptive, prospective study. METHODS: Patients with positive culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were interviewed regarding past history of anti-tuberculosis treatment, BCG vaccination, chest X-ray and family contact. M. tuberculosis isolates from 299 patients were tested for susceptibility to rifampicin, isoniazid (INH), ethambutol and streptomycin using the submerged disc proportion method. Pyrazinamide (PZA) susceptibility test was done with standard laboratory powder in 7H10 media. RESULTS: Of the 299 M. tuberculosis isolates, 17% were fully susceptible to the 5 primary drugs and 54% were resistant to 2 or more drugs (multidrug resistant TB [MDR-TB]). Initial drug resistance rate was high with ethambutol (39%) and INH (17%). Previous history of anti-tuberculosis treatment was significantly associated with MDR-TB (Odds Ratio [OR] 2.44, 95% confidence interval). Incomplete anti-TB treatment taken for longer than 3 months increased the likelihood of MDR-TB (OR 4.6, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The high rate of MDR-TB was associated with previous anti-tuberculosis treatment. The chance of developing MDR-TB was significantly increased when inadequate prior treatment was given for more than 3 months.	tuberculosis, pulmonary; tuberculosis, drug-resistant; MDR-TB (multidrug-resistant tuberculosis); drug resistance	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS
10.1378_chest.111.1.142	The significance of Mycobacterium avium complex cultivation in the sputum of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis	Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) is a ubiquitous environmental microorganism whose pathogenicity ranges from innocuous colonization to disease, in immunocompetent as well as immunocompromised individuals, We sought to determine the clinical significance of MAC in sputum cultures of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). A retrospective analysis between January 1994 and March 1995 at Bellevue Hospital Center revealed both Mycobacterium tuberculosis and MAC in 35 patients (11% of all patients with TB), Of 27 patients reviewed, 52% were HIV-1 infected (median CD4 + 25 cells per microliter). Radiographic manifestations in patients with TB and MAC were similar to those seen in patients with TB alone. Both mycobacteria were cultured primarily from respiratory sources. M tuberculosis was usually cultured first or concurrent with MAC, and in nearly all cases, both species were recovered within 2 months of each other, Most patients improved clinically, bacteriologically, and radiographically with standard antituberculous therapy, except those with advanced AIDS, multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), or disseminated MAC. We conclude that recovery of MAC in sputum is common in patients with pulmonary TB, regardless of HIV-1 infection, MDR-TB, or other clinical, bacteriologic, or radiographic attributes. MAC cultivation in most of these patients likely represents transient colonization, and in most cases is not clinically significant.

10.1378_chest.111.1.148	Drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria isolated from patients with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis in Honduras	Background: Tuberculosis is a major health problem in Central America. In Honduras, with an incidence rate of 81/100,000, it is an increasingly common cause of morbidity and hospitalization. This study was conducted to examine drug-resistant tuberculosis and prevalence of infection with atypical mycobacteria in Honduran patients with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. Methods: Pulmonary specimens from 235 Honduran patients with suspected tuberculosis were examined by acid-fast smears and culture. The 95 mycobacterial strains isolated were identified to species level and drug susceptibility tests were carried out. Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains were tested for susceptibility to six additional drugs. Their possible relationship was studied by DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results: Drug-resistant strains were found in 13 of 85 culture-verified tuberculosis patients, including 10 with isolates of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Seven of the patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis had smear-positive disease. Nine of them had a history of specific therapy. Two patients with drug-resistant disease were shown to be infected by identical strains. Only one of 11 HIV-positive patients had drug-resistant tuberculosis. Most resistant strains were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, amikacin, kanamycin, and pyrazinamide. Atypical mycobacteria were isolated from 10 patients with suspected tuberculosis. Seven of them were receiving antituberculosis chemotherapy and five had smear-positive samples. Conclusions: These results illustrate the importance of mycobacterial culture and subsequent species identification and in vitro susceptibility testing for identification of patients with drug-susceptible or drug-resistant tuberculosis and those infected or colonized with other mycobacteria.	atypical mycobacteria; drug resistance; Honduras; multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB); tuberculosis	RADIOMETRIC METHOD
10.1016_S0962_8479_97_90026_5	rhuIL-2 adjunctive therapy in multidrug resistant tuberculosis: a comparison of two treatment regimens and placebo	Setting. Low-dose recombinant human interleukin 2 (rhulL-2) adjunctive immunotherapy in multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients. Objective: Evaluation of the effects of daily versus pulse-administered rhulL-2 compared to placebo. Design: MDR-TB patients on best available antituberculous chemotherapy received rhulL-2 for 30 consecutive days (daily therapy), or for 5 days followed by a 9-day 'rest', for three cycles (pulse therapy). Placebo control patients received diluent, The cumulative total dose of rhulL-2 given to each patient in either rhulL-2 treatment group was the same. Patient immunologic, microbiologic, and radiologic responses were compared, Results: The three treatment schedules induced different results. Immune activation was documented in patients receiving daily rhulL-2 therapy. Numbers of CD25(+) and CD56(+) cells in the peripheral blood were increased in these patients, but not in patients receiving pulse rhulL-2 or placebo. In addition, 5/8 (62%) patients receiving daily rhulL-2 demonstrated reduced or cleared sputum bacterial load while only 2/7 (28%) pulse rhulL-2 treated and 2/8 (25%) controls showed bacillary clearance. Chest radiographs of 7/12 (58%) patients receiving daily rhulL-2 indicated significant improvement over 6 weeks. Only 2/9 (22%) pulse rhulL-2-treated patients and 5/12(42%) placebo controls showed radiologic improvement. Conclusion: Daily low dose rhulL-2 adjunctive treatment stimulates immune activation and may enhance the antimicrobial response in MDR-TB.		RECOMBINANT INTERLEUKIN-2; RESPONSES; CYTOKINE; IL-2
10.1001_jama.276.24.1980	Misdiagnosis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis possibly due to laboratory-related errors	Objective.-To describe 9 cases where a misdiagnosis of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) was made, possibly due to laboratory-related errors. Design.-Case series. Setting.-Public and private hospitals, outpatient clinics, and mycobacteriology laboratories serving those institutions in Los Angeles County, Calif. Patients.-Consecutive sample of 70 patients diagnosed with MDR TB who were identified between August 1993 and August 1994 by the Multidrug-Resistant Unit within TB Control in Los Angeles County. Outcome Measure.-Detection of laboratory-related diagnostic errors. Results.-Pulmonary MDR TB was misdiagnosed in 9 (13%) of 70 patients. Reasons why the diagnoses appeared to be erroneous are as follows. growth of MDR TB from an old tuberculous lesion in a patient who was never treated for TB and whose diagnosis predated anti-TB drugs (1 case), documented contamination with Mycobacterium avium complex (1 case), suspected cross-contamination (1 case), suspected specimen mislabeling (1 case), successful treatment using drugs to which the isolate was reportedly resistant (4 cases), discrepant susceptibility test results on additional sputum specimens submitted by the patient (2 cases), and no clinical evidence of TB (3 cases). Conclusions.-These cases emphasize the diagnostic errors that can occur if mycobacterial susceptibility results are not correlated with all clinical data including other laboratory results for a given patient. We conclude that susceptibility results alone are not enough to dictate treatment, and that careful clinical correlation is necessary in making the diagnosis of MDR TB.		MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS
pub-2077	The 5-year outcome of multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients in the Cape Province of South Africa	Little is known about the outcome of multidrug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) in developing countries. In this study, 443 patients with MDR-TB, defined as resistance to two or more antituberculosis drugs, were identified over the 2-year period 1987 and 1988 in the Cape Province of South Africa. The 5-year outcome of the 343 (77%) patients that could be traced by questionnaire was evaluated retrospectively during 1992 and 1993. Of these, 240 (70%) were resistant to both isoniazid (H) and rifampicin (R) with or without resistance to other first-line antituberculosis drugs and 103 (30%) were resistant to H or R and/or other antituberculosis drugs. Mortality was 116 (48%) and 28 (27%) in these groups respectively with a significantly greater risk of death in the first group. Only 114 (33%) of all the MDR-TB patients were cured after 5 years, 50 (15%) were respiratory disabled and 44 (13%) were still bacteriology positive. Twenty-four (7%) patients were lost during follow-up. Taking into account the high costs involved in treating MDR-TB patients and the scarce resources available in developing countries, more emphasis should be placed on direct observed therapy to cure newly diagnosed infectious drug sensitive tuberculosis patients, thus preventing MDR-TB rather than treating it.	multidrug resistant; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; outcome; mortality; morbidity; contacts	
10.1007_s002849900095	In vitro activities of fourteen antimicrobial agents against drug susceptible and resistant clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and comparative intracellular activities against the virulent H37Rv strain in human macrophages	Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 14 first and second-line antituberculous drugs against drug-susceptible and drug-resistant clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (including the multiple drug-resistant or MDR-TB isolates), as well as the type strain H37Rv, were determined radiometrically by the Bactec 460-TB methodols. MICs (mu g/ml) of all the fourteen drugs were within an extremely narrow range in case of susceptible strains; isoniazid (0.02-0.04), rifampin (0.2-0.4), ethambutol and streptomycin (0.5-2.0), ethionamide (0.25-0.5), D-cycloserine (25-75), capreomycin (1-2), kanamycin (2-4), amikacin (0.5-1.0), clofazimine (0.1-0.4), ofloxacin (0.5-1.0), ciprofloxacin (0.25-1.0), and sparfloxacin (0.1-0.4). The activity of second-line drugs remained unaltered against MDR-TB isolates resistant to routine first-line drugs. With peak serum level concentrations (Cmax), the intracellular killing of the virulent H37Rv strain was studied in detail in cultured human macrophages. Based on an decreasing order of bactericidal activity, our results showed the following spectrum of intracellular drug action: among the first-line drugs, rifampin > ethionamide = isoniazid > ethambutol > streptomycin > D-cycloserine; among second-line drugs, clofazimine = amikacin > kanamycin = capreomycin; among fluoroquinolones, sparfloxacin > ofloxacin > ciprofloxacin. On the other hand, contrary to atypical mycobacteria, the macrolide drug clarithromycin was inactive against both extracellular and intracellular M. tuberculosis.

10.1016_S0196_6553_96_90054_1	Status of tuberculosis infection control programs at United States hospitals, 1989 to 1992	Background: Recent nosocomial outbreaks have raised concern about the risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission in United States hospitals. Methods: To determine current tuberculosis (TB) infection control practices, we surveyed a sample of approximately 3000 acute care facilities about the number of patients with drug-susceptible or multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), health care worker (HCW) tuberculin skin test (TST) results, and compliance with the 1990 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) TB guidelines. Analyses were restricted to one response per hospital. Results: Personnel at 1494 (49.8%) hospitals returned a completed survey. Respondent hospitals had a mean of 881 HCWs (range 8 to 10,000) and 196 (range 6 to 2450) beds; 62% percent were community nonteaching hospitals. Of respondent hospitals providing data for 1989 through 1992, the proportion that cared for patients with TB or MDR-TB increased from 46.4% to 56.6% and 0.8% to 4.5%, respectively. The pooled mean HCW TST positivity rate at hire rose from 0.95% to 1.14%, and the pooled mean HCW TST conversion rate increased from 0.40% To 0.51%. In 1992, when we compared hospitals with zero, one to five, or six or greater patients with TB, the risk of a positive HCW TST result at hire or at routine testing significantly increased with increasing number of patients with TB. From 1989 through 1992, the number of hospitals reporting the use of surgical masks for HCW respiratory protection decreased from 96.8% to 66.8%. In 1992, 66% of the hospitals reported compliance with four or more of the AFB isolation room criteria specified in the 1990 CDC TB guidelines. Conclusions: Contrary to prior surveys, this study shows that many U.S. community hospitals admit patients with TB less frequently than do teaching hospitals, and infrequently admit patients with MDR-TB. Because the risk of HCW TST conversion varies with hospital characteristics, these data show the importance of performing a risk assessment, as recommended in the CDC TB guidelines, for each ward and hospital so that TB control measures can be individualized.

10.4065_71.3.221	Prospective evaluation of the utility of molecular techniques for diagnosing nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis	Objective: To compare molecular techniques with conventional diagnostic methods for evaluating nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Design: We conducted a 12-week postexposure inception cohort study of health-care personnel who had been exposed to a patient with MDR-TB. Material and Methods: In addition to baseline and follow-up tuberculin skin tests and chest roentgenography, meekly pulmonary specimens were evaluated by (1) auramine-rhodamine fluorescent staining, (2) culture for mycobacteria, and (3) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify IS6110, a nucleic acid insertion sequence unique to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Results: The index patient's isolate of M. tuberculosis showed a mutation in codon 531 of the RNA polymerase beta subunit (rpoB) gene of M. tuberculosis, which is associated with rifampin resistance and considered a marker for this MDR-TB strain. All pulmonary and gastric specimens from study participants had negative auramine stains and cultures for mycobacteria. One person, however, had separate specimens with repeatedly positive PCR results for IS6110 sequences, but the specimens contained a wildtype M. tuberculosis rpoB codon 531 dissimilar from the index patient's strain. Conclusion: Although both molecular and conventional testing showed that no exposed person was infected with the MDR-TB strain, molecular test results were available sooner and seemed more sensitive for detecting M. tuberculosis in one exposed person, presumably in a preinfection or ''colonized'' stage. Molecular methods provided information that helped distinguish this person's M. tuberculosis strain from the index patient's MDR-TB strain. Additional prospective studies should assess the value of these molecular techniques in similar clinical settings.		MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; HIV-INFECTION; BACILLI; RISK
10.1164_ajrccm.153.1.8542137	Outcome of MDR-TB patients, 1983-1993 - Prolonged survival with appropriate therapy	We analyzed the clinical and laboratory findings and outcome of 173 patients hospitalized at our institution from 1983 to 1994 with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and evaluated outcome. The 173 patients (mean age 40 +/- 1 yr) were predominantly male (92%), African American or Hispanic (80%), and mostly undomiciled. Over half (52%) were known to be HIV-infected. HIV-positive MDR-TB patients had significantly more pulmonary and constitutional symptoms, more extrapulmonary disease, and fewer cavitary lesions on chest radiographs. Fifty-five percent of the patients in the cohort have died; mortality was significantly greater for HIV-positive than HIV-negative (72% versus 20%, p < 0.01). The median duration of survival of MDR-TB patients was 22 +/- 1 mo. Overall, extrapulmonary involvement was a risk factor for shorter survival, while a cavitary lesion on initial chest film and institution of appropriate treatment were positive predictors of survival. In HIV+ patients, only appropriate therapy was associated with prolonged survival (median of 14.1 mo). Interestingly, there was a trend toward better outcome in the first half of the decade reviewed. We conclude that although mortality from MDR-TB is high in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients, institution of appropriate therapy is the factor most strongly associated with a favorable outcome. Development of new and therapeutic strategies for MDR-TB are urgently needed.

10.1016_0962_8479_95_90522_7	Drug resistant tuberculosis in sub-Saharan Africa: An estimation of incidence and cost for the year 2000	Objectives: To evaluate the tuberculosis (TB) drug resistance in Rwanda on smear positive sputa, collected prospectively at the start of the National TB programme, before the start of any treatment or retreatment. To adapt the scenarios of Schulzer et al (1992) to the data from Rwanda, in order to obtain an estimation of the number of drug resistant and multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB cases expected by the year 2000. Design: A total of 298 specimens (236 randomly selected new cases and 62 retreated cases), collected between January 1991 and June 1993, were sent to Belgium in 1% cetylpyridinium chloride. Drug resistance was determined using the proportion method. Results: MDR, i.e. resistance to at least rifampicin (R) and isoniazid (H), was observed in 3 (1.3%) out of 236 new cases and in 4 (6.5%) out of 62 retreated cases. For new cases, single drug resistance to H, R and ethambutol (E) was 3%, 0.4% and 4.2% respectively; for retreated cases it was 14.5%, 1.6% and 6.5% respectively. Based on the estimate of the size of the TB problem in sub-Saharan Africa by the year 2000 (Schulzer), we calculated that the region should expect between 15 543 and 223 417 cases of MDR, all forms combined (between 2.3 and 32.7 per 100 000 inhabitants), by the end of the century. Conclusion: The results from Rwanda during the period studied do not appear dramatic. However, for some other developing countries, they may just represent the tip of the iceberg. Rapid recognition of resistance to the major antituberculosis agents is essential for control of TB. Integration of an MDR increase factor into the TB budget would not dramatically increase the total TB budget. Our data urgently point to the need for drug resistance surveys, followed by continuous drug resistance monitoring in high TB prevalence areas.		EMERGENCE
10.1093_clinids_21.5.1238	IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS WITH MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS	We conducted a retrospective study of patients with culture-confirmed multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center (South Bronx, NY) to determine what factors affected clinical and microbiological responses and survival. For the 38 patients with MDR-TB, reporting of first-line drug susceptibilities was relatively rapid (median time, 30 days). Thirty-four patients (89%) were infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and initial and overall response rates were 59% and 50%, respectively; the median survival was 315 days; and 50% of these patients died of tuberculosis. Bivariate analysis revealed that the following factors had a positive impact on response and survival: receiving greater than or equal to 2 consecutive weeks of appropriate therapy with at least two drugs to which the isolate was susceptible in vitro; starting appropriate therapy within 4 weeks of the diagnosis; and having tuberculosis that was limited to the lungs. Multivariate analysis revealed that the only variable associated with response was receipt of appropriate therapy for greater than or equal to 2 consecutive weeks. In contrast to findings in the published literature, our results indicate the outcome of MDR-TB can be improved, particularly for severely immunosuppressed HIV-infected patients. Rapid reporting of susceptibilities and prompt initiation and continuation of appropriate antituberculous therapy improved response and survival.

10.1093_clinids_21.5.1245	PREDICTORS AND OUTCOME OF MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS	We identify early predictors of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and describe improved clinical outcomes, including survival, for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) when they are prospectively identified and receive treatment under direct observation. Analysis by means of a Cox proportional hazards model revealed that failure to defervesce while receiving a standard four-drug antituberculous regimen was independently associated with multidrug resistance (P = .004), When patients with HIV-related MDR-TB were prospectively identified and treated with at least two agents that were active in vitro, 100% bacteriologic conversion and improved survival (greater than or equal to 4 months for 88% of patients and greater than or equal to 1 year for 59% of patients) were observed. For patients with HN-related tuberculosis, poorer survival was associated with a CD4(+) lymphocyte count of <25 mm(3) (P = .03); multidrug resistance was not a predictor of poor outcome (P = .82). These data suggest that patients with prolonged fever who are receiving antituberculous therapy may be an appropriate subgroup to target for broader empirical therapy. The findings also demonstrate that improved outcomes can be achieved with HIV-related MDR-TB when patients are prospectively identified and treated with agents that are active in vitro.

pub-2086	CLINICAL AND IMMUNE-RESPONSES OF TUBERCULOSIS PATIENTS TREATED WITH LOW-DOSE IL-2 AND MULTIDRUG THERAPY	The immune response to infection with M. tuberculosis depends on cytokine activation of effector cells. We therefore conducted a pilot study of recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhuIL-2) as an adjunct to multidrug therapy (MDT) to evaluate the safety of this approach and to determine whether IL-2 can enhance the cellular immune response in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Patients included in this study presented with a wide range of extent and duration of infection, and were grouped into three categories for data analysis: (1) patients with newly diagnosed, acute-stage TB who were lust beginning MDT; (2) patients who had received a minimum of 45 days MDT before the start of the study and who had responded to treatment; and (3) patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB who had been on MDT for at least seven months without apparent beneficial clinical response. Twenty patients received 30 days of twice-daily intradermal injections of 12.5 pg of IL-2. Patients from all three groups showed improvement of clinical symptoms over the 30-day period of treatment with IL-2 and MDT. Results of direct smear for acid fast bacilli (AFB) demonstrated conversion to sputum negative following IL-2 and MDT treatment in all newly diagnosed patients and in 5/7 MDR TB patients. (The size of the skin test response to purified protein derivative (PPD) of tuberculin Increased during the 30-day IL-2 adjunctive therapy in newly diagnosed patients, but decreased or disappeared in the other two groups of treated patients.) Assays in vitro for phenotype distribution, natural killer (NK) cell activity, frequency of cells proliferating in response to exogenous IL-2, and antigen-induced blastogenesis demonstrated systemic responses to Intradermally administered rhuIL-2. Levels of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) IFN-gamma mRNA and IFN-gamma mRNA in biopsy of site of skin test response to purified protein derivative (PPD) were highest in those patients with the most acute symptoms at the beginning of the study, and decreased during rhuIL-2 and MDT. IL-2 immunotherapy did not modify levels of mRNA expression for other cytokines. Patients receiving IL-2 did not experience clinical deterioration or significant side effects. These results suggest that IL-2 administration in combination with conventional MDT is safe and may potentiate the antimicrobial cellular immune response to TB.

STATUS OF TB INFECTION-CONTROL PROGRAMS AT MEMBER HOSPITALS, 1989-1992	OBJECTIVE: To determine trends in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in healthcare workers, tuberculosis (TB) control measures, and compliance with the 1990 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guideline for preventing transmission of TB in healthcare facilities. DESIGN: Voluntary questionnaire sent to all members of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, representing 359 hospitals. RESULTS: Respondents' hospitals (210 [58%]) had a median of 2,400 healthcare workers (range, 396 to 13,745), 437 beds (range, 48 to 1,250), 5.6 patients with TB per year (range, 0 to 499), and 0 multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB patients per year (range, 0 to 33). Of 166 respondents' hospitals for which data were provided for 1989 through 1992, the number caring for MDR-TB patients increased from 10 (6%) in 1989 to 49 (30%) in 1992. Reported policies for routine healthcare worker tuberculin skin testing varied. The median skin-test positivity rate for healthcare workers at the time of hire increased from 0.54% in 1989 to 0.81% in 1992, but the median conversion rate during routine testing remained similar: 0.35% in 1989 and 0.33% in 1992. Among 196 hospitals with reported data on respiratory protection use for 1989 through 1992, the use of either surgical submicron, dust-mist, or dust-fume-mist respirators for healthcare workers increased from 9 (5%) in 1989 to 85 (43%) in 1992. Of 181 hospitals with reported data, 113 (62%) had acid-fast bacilli isolation facilities consistent with the 1990 CDC guideline (ie, a single patient room, negative air pressure relative to the hallway, air exhausted directly outside, and greater than or equal to 6 air exchanges per hour). CONCLUSIONS: While the number of surveyed hospitals caring for TB and MDR-TB patients increased during 1989 through 1992, TB infection control measures at many hospitals still did not meet the 1990 CDC guideline recommendations		RESISTANT MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; NOSOCOMIAL TRANSMISSION; OUTBREAK
pub-2088	EVALUATION OF INFECTION-CONTROL MEASURES IN PREVENTING THE NOSOCOMIAL TRANSMISSION OF MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS IN A NEW-YORK-CITY HOSPITAL	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended infection control measures implemented in response to an outbreak of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort studies of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients and healthcare workers. The study period (January 1989 through September 1992) was divided into period I, before changes in infection control; period II, after aggressive use of administrative controls (eg, rapid placement of TB patients or suspected TB patients in single-patient rooms); and period III, while engineering changes were made (eg, improving ventilation in TB isolation rooms). SETTING: A New York City hospital that was the site of one of the first reported outbreaks of MDR-TB among AIDS patients in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: All AIDS patients admitted during periods I and II. Healthcare workers on nine inpatient units with TB patients and six without TB patients. RESULTS: The epidemic (38 patients) waned during period II and only one MDR-TB patient presented during period III. The MDR-TB attack rate among AIDS patients hospitalized on the same ward on the same days as an infectious MDR-TB patient was 8.8% (19 of 216) during period I, decreasing to 2.6% (5 of 193; P=0.01) during period II. In a small group of healthcare workers with tuberculin skin test data, conversions during periods II through III were higher on wards with than without TB patients (5 of 29 versus 0 of 15; P=0.15), although the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission of MDR-TB among AIDS patients decreased markedly after enforcement of readily implementable administrative measures, ending the outbreak. However, tuberculin skin-test conversions among healthcare workers may not have been prevented by these measures.

pub-2089	NOSOCOMIAL TUBERCULOSIS - AN OUTBREAK OF A STRAIN RESISTANT TO 7 DRUGS	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB). DESIGN: Outbreak investigation: review of infection control practices and skin test results of healthcare workers (HCWs); medical records of hospitalized TB patients and mycobacteriology reports; submission of specimens for restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing; and an assessment of the air-handling system. SETTING: A teaching hospital in upstate New York. RESULTS: Skin-test conversions occurred among 46 (6.6%) of 696 HCWs tested from August through October 1991. Rates were highest on two units (29% and 20%); HCWs primarily assigned to these units had a higher risk for conversion compared with HCWs tested following previous incidents of exposure to TB (relative risk [RR]=53.4, 95% confidence interval [CI95]=6.9 to 411.1; and RR=37.4, CI95=5.0 to 277.3, respectively). The likely source patient was the only TB patient hospitalized on both units during the probable exposure period. This patient appeared clinically infectious, was associated with a higher risk of conversion among HCWs providing direct care (RR=2.37; CI95=1.05 to 5.34), and was a prison inmate with TB resistant to seven antituberculosis agents. The MDR-TB strain isolated from this patient also was isolated from other inmate and noninmate patients, and a prison correctional officer exposed in the hospital. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from all of these patients had matching RFLP patterns. Infection control practices closely followed established guidelines; however, several rooms housing TB patients had marginal negative pressure with variable numbers of air changes per hour, and directional airflow was disrupted easily. CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly suggest nosocomial transmission of MDR-TB to HCWs, patients, and a prison correctional officer working in the hospital. Factors contributing to transmission apparently included prolonged infectiousness of the likely source patient and inadequate environmental controls.

pub-2090	TRANSMISSION OF MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS AMONG PERSONS EXPOSED IN A MEDICAL EXAMINERS OFFICE, NEW-YORK	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of and risk factors for having a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) result among employees at a medical examiner's office (MEO). DESIGN: Cohort study, environmental investigation. SETTING: Several employees at a medical examiner's office were found to have positive TST results after autopsies were performed on persons with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). PARTICIPANTS: Employees of the MEO. RESULTS: Of 18 MEO employees, 5 (28%) had a positive TST result; 2 of these 5 had TST conversions. We observed a trend between TST conversion and participation in autopsies on persons with MDR-TB (2 of 2 converters versus 3 of 13 employees with negative TST; relative risk=4.3; 95% confidence interval 1.61 to 11.69; P=0.10). The environmental investigation revealed that the autopsy room was at positive pressure relative to the rest of the MEO and that air from the autopsy room mixed throughout the facility. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic approach to preventing transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in autopsy suites should include effective environmental controls and routine tuberculin skin testing of employees		IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS INFECTION; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; IMPACT

Measures similar to those subsequently recommended in the 1990 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines were implemented on the HIV ward by June, 1990, and in September, 1992, we evaluated the efficacy of these control measures. Among MDR-TB patients and healthcare workers with tuberculin-skin-test conversions on the HIV ward, we looked for evidence of exposure to HIV ward MDR-TB patients positive for acid-fast bacilli in sputum during initial January-May, 1990) and follow-up (June, 1990-June, 1992) periods. Exposure before implementation of control measures to an infectious MDR-TB patient on the HIV ward was recorded in 12 of 15 (80%) MDR-TB patients during the initial period and 5 of 11(45%) MDR-TB patients during follow-up. After implementation of control measures, no episodes of MDR-TB could be traced to contact with infectious MDR-TB patients on the HIV ward. Skin-test conversions among workers on the HIV ward declined from 7 of 25 (28%) during the initial period to 3 of 17 (18%) in the early (June, 1990-February, 1998) and 0 of 23 in the late (March, 1991-June, 1992) follow-up periods (p<0.01). Skin-test conversions among healthcare workers were not associated with increased exposure to MDR-TB patients, and were not significantly higher among workers on the HIV ward than on a control ward without tuberculosis patients (3/27 vs 0/16). These data demonstrate that implementation of measures similar to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1990 tuberculosis-control guidelines were effective in halting transmission of MDR-TB to healthcare workers and HIV-infected patients.

pub-2092	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS IN AN HIV DENTAL CLINIC	OBJECTIVE:To investigate possible transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in a dental setting. DESIGN: A retrospective, descriptive study of dental workers (DWs), patients, and practice characteristics. PATIENTS: Two dental workers (DW1 and DW2) with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and MDR-TB. SETTING: A hospital-based (Hospital X) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) dental clinic in New York City. METHODS: To identify dental patients with tuberculosis (TB), patients treated in the dental clinic at Hospital X during 1990 were cross-matched with those listed in the New York City Department of Health Tuberculosis Registry. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from both DWs and from dental patients with TB were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and typed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Infection control practices were reviewed. RESULTS: M tuberculosis isolates infecting DWI and DW2 were resistant to isoniazid and rifampin and had identical RFLP patterns. DW1 and DW2 worked in close proximity to each other in a small HIV dental clinic in Hospital X during 1990. Of 472 patients treated in the dental clinic in 1990, 41 (8.7%) had culture-proven M tuberculosis infection. Of these 41, 5 had isolates with resistance patterns similar to both DWs; however, for four available isolates, the RFLP patterns were different from the patterns of the DWs. Sixteen of the 41 patients received dental treatment while potentially infectious. Dental patients were not routinely questioned about TB by dental staff, nor were all dental staff screened routinely for TB. No supplemental environmental measures for TB were employed in the dental clinic in 1990. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation suggests that MDR-TB transmission may have occurred between two DWs in an HIV dental clinic. Opportunities for transmission of TB among dental staff and patients were identified. TB surveillance programs for DWs and appropriate infection control strategies, including worker education, are needed to monitor and minimize exposure to TB in dental settings providing care to patients at risk for TB		INFECTED PATIENTS; NOSOCOMIAL TRANSMISSION; OUTBREAK
10.1378_chest.106.2.431	PREVENTIVE THERAPY FOR CONTACTS OF MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS - A DELPHI SURVEY	Objective: Several outbreaks of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) have recently occurred in which healthcare workers and others have become infected. Given the lack of clinical data to guide preventive therapy for such contacts, a Delphi survey of a panel of 31 TB therapy experts was undertaken to identify a consensus regimen. Design: An initial questionnaire presented three scenarios describing persons with significant exposure to MDR-TB and with new tuberculin skin test reactions >15 mm (except one anergic patient) without evidence of disease. Panelists were asked to suggest possible preventive therapy regimens. Methods: During a second round survey, the panel members were asked to review the suggested regimens provided for each scenario and to rank them from one to nine as extremely inappropriate to extremely appropriate. Results of this second survey were tabulated and shared with the members of the panel who were then asked to rerank each regimen in light of the previous cumulative panel responses. Results: No specific regimen achieved initial positive consensus by predefined criteria. In two of the three scenarios the no treatment option, however, was deemed clearly inappropriate. The data were also analyzed by what percentage of respondents who ranked a regimen as at all appropriate tie, six or more on the nine point scale). For scenarios involving a nurse, an HIV-positive tuberculin reactor, and a patient who was anergic HIV-positive, treatment with pyrazinamide 1,500 mg daily with ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice a day for 4 months received a somewhat appropriate rating from more than 50 percent of respondents. Conclusions: The management of persons exposed to and infected by patients with MDR-TB has become a serious problem in the context of MDR-TB outbreaks. This panel of experts agreed that some form of preventive therapy was warranted; however, they were not able to reach defined consensus on what regimen should be used, although a regimen of pyrazinamide 1,500 mg daily with ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice a day for 4 months was considered somewhat appropriate. Clinical data on the efficacy of alternative preventive therapy regimens for such contacts are urgently needed.

Inmate lists were linked to 1990-1992 TB registries, medical records were reviewed, and movement histories for inmates with MDR-TB were examined within and between prisons and hospitals. In 1990-1991, 171 inmates were diagnosed with TB. This rate (156.2/ 100,000) was significantly higher than the 1990-1991 US rate (10.4/100,000) and the 1986 rate among NYS inmates (105.5/100,000). Of 171 cases, 155 were culture-confirmed; 37 (32%) of 116 with drug susceptibilities determined had MDR-TB. Two other inmates with TB before 1990 were diagnosed with MDR-TB in 1990-1991. Of 39 inmates with MDR-TB, 38 (97%) were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus and 34 (87%) have died. These 39 lived in 23 of the 68 NYS prisons while potentially infectious; 12 were transferred through 20 prisons while ill with MDR-TB. Policies of correctional systems on infection control and inmate transfers need to be reevaluated to prevent spread of TB.

10.1001_jama.271.9.665	NATIONWIDE SURVEY OF DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS IN THE UNITED-STATES	Objective.-To determine antituberculosis drug resistance patterns, geographic distribution, demographic characteristics, and risk factors of reported tuberculosis (TB) patients in the United States. Design.-Survey of reported TB cases in the United States. For culture-positive cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we asked health departments to provide drug susceptibility test results from initial Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. Study Population.-Culture-positive TB cases in the United States reported during the first quarter of 1991. Main Outcome Measures.-Individual TB case reports submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and drug susceptibility test results. Result.-Resistance to one or more antituberculosis drugs was found in 14.2% of cases. Resistance to isoniazid and/or rifampin was found in 9.5% of cases whose isolates were tested against one or both drugs; such cases were found in 107 counties in 33 states. Resistance to both isoniazid and rifampin (multidrug-resistant [MDR] TB) was found in 3.5% of cases whose isolates were tested against both drugs; such cases were found in 35 counties in 13 states. New York City accounted for 61.4% of the nation's MDR TB cases. The 3-month population-based incidence rate of MDR TB in New York City was 52.4 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 35.5 to 78.3) that of the rest of the nation (9.559 vs 0.182 cases per million population). Compared with the rate in non-Hispanic whites in the rest of the nation (0.032 cases per million), the relative risk of MDR TB in New York City non-Hispanic whites was 39.0 (95% CI, 8.1 to 164.5), 299.3 (95% CI, 112.5 to 927.1) in Hispanics, 420.9 (95% CI, 121.0 to 1515.8) in Asian/Pacific islanders, and 701.0 (95% CI, 296.4 to 2018.1) in non-Hispanic blacks. Conclusions.-With nearly 10% of TB patients resistant to isoniazid and/or rifampin, greater use of four-drug regimens and directly observed therapy is indicated. Aggressive intervention to prevent the further spread of MDR TB is needed to find every TB patient and to provide optimal patient, management to ensure completion of chemotherapy.

10.1378_chest.105.1.45	THE 3RD EPIDEMIC-MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS	We recently observed a striking increase in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) among patients admitted to the Chest Service at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York. We reviewed the laboratory susceptibility test results of 4,681 tuberculosis (TB) cases over the past 20 years. Combined resistance to isoniazid and rifampin increased hum 2.5 percent in 1971 to 16 percent in 1991 with higher rates noted for individual drugs. We reviewed the medical records of 100 patients with drug-resistant TB, finding that these individuals were predominantly less than 40 years of age, minority, male, jobless, undomiciled, with a high percentage of drug abuse and human immnnodeficiency virus infection. We conclude that the epidemics of AIDS and TB are complicated by a third epidemic of MDR-TB. This third epidemic requires urgent attention to achieve more rapid diagnosis, to develop new therapeutic regimens, and to address the social and hospital environment to care for these individuals.

10.1016_0923_2508_93_90025_W	NOSOCOMIAL TRANSMISSION OF MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS	Concomitant with the resurgence of tuberculosis in the United States have been increasing reports of nosocomial transmission of TB. From January 1990 through September 1992, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) investigated eight nosocomial outbreaks of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Over 200 patients were infected; approximately 75 % of these patients died. Risk factors for infection included human immunodeficiency virus infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and recent hospitalization on the same ward as other MDR-TB patients. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of M. tuberculosis isolates revealed unique strains were transmitted in each hospital. In three hospitals, health care workers (HCW) assigned to wards with MDR-TB patients were shown to be more likely to have tuberculin skin test (TST) conversions than HCW assigned to wards without MDR-TB patients. These outbreaks demonstrate the serious morbidity and mortality associated with nosocomial MDR-TB and emphasize the importance of adhering to current CDC guidelines for preventing the transmission of tuberculosis in healtheare settings, with special focus on HIV-related issues.

pub-2100	THE MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS CHALLENGE TO PUBLIC-HEALTH EFFORTS TO CONTROL TUBERCULOSIS	After years of steady decline, there has been an unprecedented resurgence of tuberculosis (TB) in the United States and outbreaks of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The authors assess the nature, epidemiology, and implications of MDR-TB; provide suggestions for preventing drug resistance among patients with drug-susceptible TB; and offer recommendations for managing patients with MDR-TB. They outline the National Action Plan to Combat MDR-TB. Close collaboration among medical practitioners and staff members of TB control programs is needed to ensure the most effective management of patients with TB and their contacts. This collaboration is one of the most important steps for successful control of MDR-TB.
